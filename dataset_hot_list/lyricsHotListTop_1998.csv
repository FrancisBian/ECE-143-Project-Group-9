0,Lately,"[Intro: Witt Lowry]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
Lately, I been reminded, they say that time's of the essence
You pulled me deep from the trenches, I guess we're here for confessions
And lately, I been reminded that love is patient and blind
I could write a million lines and never find the words to define us
I know it's best not to rush
I know you're unsure of your worth, I know how deep that can cut
He broke you down, so you don't feel much, there's forty-thousand strings
Holding back our past precaution, not often I let you in
It's not often you let me in, I get it, I mean why would you to
Take a chance on me then? I get it, I mean why should you?
'Cause me, I'm just a waiter with lucid dreams of the music
And you, you could find any guy, open mind in a student
I say it, in case we lose it, I hope that that never happens
I know our love runs deeper than just lust and attraction
I guess it's all the little things lately that make me think
I remember nights by the beach and us laughin' 'til we can't breathe
Or that CVS down the street, I don't know if you would agree
But I think

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry]
Lately, I been reminded that love is all that is timeless
The pain you paint on your face, I see strength behind both your eyelids
And lately I been reminded, I'm flawed, and nobody's perfect
The distance isn't easy, but nothin' is when it's worth it
I'm workin' to bring your wall down, I sense the weight that you carry
I wish you would let it all out and trust me, because I can't see
I wish you wouldn't compare me, he loved you without your clothes
But no, he's never seen you naked, never seen into your soul
And I love the way I see your mind wander when I get deep with you
I wonder why you cry when I tell you that I believe in you
I wish that I could take away the pain of how he treated you
My favorite nights were nights when it felt like it were just me and you
Damn, and if you ever cannot stand me
I hope that I made an impact and showed your heart what love can be
Envision us with a family, envision us where it's sandy
I feel you bringin' me closer in love with lovin' what can be
I know

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

[Verse 3: Witt Lowry]
I think about the nights you cried as you reminisce on your parents
And the way you know that money can't buy love is apparent
You're self-conscious of your ears, your hair's always down when you wear it
And you know I never drink when I'm Saké drunk, it's apparent
I know, I just love watching you grow, you feel the weight on my soul
I always mess with a temp, I'm always hot when you're cold
And if they told us our love was just for a season
I want you to know I loved you, I gave my all and I mean it
I know…

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better",Witt Lowry,1998,"[3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 20, 22, 30, 36]",16
1,From This Moment On,"[Intro: Shania Twain]

For better for worse, I will love you
With every beat of my heart

From this moment life has begun
From this moment, you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong

And for your love, I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

[Chorus 1: Shania Twain, Bryan White, Both]

3,Because Of You,"[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

4,Doo Wop (That Thing),"[Intro]
Yo, remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like
Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

[Hook]
Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again, come again
Come again, come again

[Bridge]
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Hook]
Girls, you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys, you know you'd better watch out
'Cause girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Skit/Outro]
Class!
Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”, I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay, You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this: You’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(She poetic)
She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?",Lauryn Hill,1998,"[7, 5, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1]",7
5,Love Like This,"[Verse 1]
Running through the heat, heart beat
You shine like silver in the sunlight
You light up my cold heart
It feels right in the sun, the sun
We're running around and 'round
Like nothing else could matter in our lives
But wait, but wait, but wait
The sun will stop shining soon
And you'll be dark in my life
Yeah, you'll be gone
It's as simple as a change of heart
But I'm not gonna think about the future

[Chorus]
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, I don't really mind
I don't really mind at all

[Verse 2]
Step into the night, love
It grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the back streets, yeah, you'll never notice me
All that I was thinking about
Was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart
Mm, just as simple as a change of heart

[Chorus]
I know now, a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I

[Bridge]
I know that a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, and I
I don't mind at all

[Outro]
A love like this won't last forever
A love like this (a love like this)
A love like this won't last forever

6,Have You Ever?,"[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything to make them understand
Have you ever had someone steal your heart away
You'd give anything to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

[Verse 2]
Have you ever found the one
You've dreamed of all of your life
You'd do just about anything to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to
Only to find that one won't give their heart to you
Have you ever closed your eyes and
Dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

[Bridge]
What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby
What do I gotta say to get to your heart
To make you understand how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world
Cause baby I can't sleep

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night (just can't sleep at night )
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever, ever, ever
Have you ever",Brandy,1998,"[9, 10, 10, 15]",4
7,Lullaby,"[Intro]
I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

[Verse 1]
On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

[Bridge]
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

[Outro]

8,Goodbye,"[Intro]
Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
Bitch, you're a black hole, sucking me in your vacuum
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future, then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?
(Why you acting like a peasant?)
I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes
Goodbye, bye
(Fucked it all up! Stupid!)
Goodbye!

[Verse 2]
Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!
(That's just one bum you should've told)
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye (Know you fucked this up!), bye
(And I'ma call you from the Grammies, too!)
Goodbye! (Hopefully you pick up, so I can tell you again)
Goodbye-bye-bye!",Russ,1998,[11],1

I'm going out tonight again
Anything to capture your attention (Your attention)
And she's a real sweet girl
And you know I got a boy
Details we both forgot to mention (Forgot to mention)

And you...
I always know where you are
And you always know where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end

[Chorus]
This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss
(This kiss, this kiss, this kiss)

[Verse 2]
You know you're just my type
And your eyes are lock and key
To my heart, tempting my confession (My confession)
And you're a real hot thing
But you know I've got a boy somewhere
So, can you feel the tension? (Feel the tension)

Boy, this evening, was it only me
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of getting in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinking

[Chorus]
I should make a move but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

[Verse 2]
We were chillin, watching your TV
I thought you were coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carrying on
Try to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's getting too late
I'm thinking

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

(If) If you want me
You got to know me
And if you want my love
You gotta win my love

Hey baby
That's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me, get to know me
So we can do this

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't

I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again

21,My Favorite Mistake,"[Intro]
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh

[Verse 1]
I woke up and called this morning
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore

[Verse 2]
I made up the bed we sleep in
I looked at the clock when you creep in
It's 6 a.m. and I'm alone

[Chorus]
Did you know when you go
It's the perfect ending
To the bad day I was just beginning?
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake

[Verse 3]
Your friends are sorry for me
They watch you pretend to adore me
But I'm no fool to this game

[Verse 4]
Now here comes your secret lover
She'd be unlike any other
Until your guilt goes up in flames

[Chorus]
Did you know when you go
It's the perfect ending
To the bad day I’d gotten used to spending?
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake

[Bridge]
Well, maybe nothing lasts forever
Even when you stay together
I don't need forever after
It's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way

[Verse 5]
Did you know, could you tell
You were the only one
That I ever loved?
Now everything's so wrong

[Outro]
Did you see me walking by?
Did it ever make you cry?
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake",Sheryl Crow,1998,"[24, 20, 23, 23]",4

23,Thank U,"[Verse 1]
How 'bout getting off of these antibiotics
How 'bout stopping eating when I'm full up
How 'bout them transparent dangling carrots
How 'bout that ever elusive kudo

[Chorus 1]
Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you, thank you silence

[Verse 2]
How 'bout me not blaming you for everything
How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once
How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you
How 'bout grieving it all one at a time

[Chorus 1]
Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you, thank you silence

[Bridge]
The moment I let go of it
Was the moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it
Was the moment I touched down

[Verse 3]
How 'bout no longer being masochistic
How 'bout remembering your divinity
How 'bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How 'bout not equating death with stopping

[Chorus 2]
Thank you India
Thank you providence
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you nothingness
Thank you clarity
Thank you, thank you silence

24,One Week,"[Verse 1]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
""Get that together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

[Chorus]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Verse 3]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Verse 4: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

[Chorus]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

[Verse 5]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

[Outro]
It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say ""Wasabi""

Never thought that love could feel like this
And you've changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle

Your love is like a river: peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep

You are the one that surpasses them all

The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child

[Intro]
Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked

Not to kiss you over, under
Feel you inside, feel my thunder

Make me the man (oh, yes you do)
God knows I'm proud to be

35,Changes,"[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Interlude: 2Pac]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
(You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

At half past a heartache at quarter to four
Were you starting to worry I was finally getting over you
I almost forgot you looked so fine
If you told me some lies, it would be like old times
Just getting to see you is almost worth the things you do


You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart

I got to admit to you got a smile
That really reeled me in for awhile
But it ain't funny, honey, what you put me through
So why don't you send me your photograph
It'd hurt a lot less than taking you back
Then I could still have my favorite part of you


Cause you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone & Thug Queen]
The name is Krayzie, big bad-ass Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with it so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double crossed by the law so there's nobody to run to
Yeah its just me and my sawed off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face
I'm headed for the west
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well uh, I oughtta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin' dark so now now I'm watchin' for them damn injuns
They like to catch us, then they rob and split
I be a rootin', tootin', shootin' damn fool, protecting my chips
All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse ""whoa nellie""
Who in the bushes you betta speak out or I'ma let my shotgun song sing out
Who is this? Hope this ain't the lawJar out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun
Come on out right now I'm gettin angry
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot its just me Thug Queen the horse stealer
Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes
I'm wanted in four counties
For armed robberies
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law that's why I jumped in them bushes
Goodness, now she was hotter than the barrel of fire
But I could use her for the job so I told her to ride come on
May I ask you what you headed to the west for?
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you down you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you with it
We out before the sunrise
Gotta stallion for ya partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine
Down for whatever lets ride lets ride
These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the morning for details and hookups

[Chorus]
You betta count your money (ghetto)
You betta count your money (cowboy)
You betta count your money (ghetto)
You betta count your money (cowboy)

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone, Thug Queen]
Rise and shine, good morning howdy
Nine o clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now I done came along way I don't wanna be late
Tell him we make it to him
You know where we at (Move Out!)

[Chorus 2]
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up
You betta count your money (ghetto)
You betta count your money (cowboy)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone, Powder P, Krayzie Bone & Thug Queen]
I'm peepin' Krazyie's warning poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glance across the room I see this youngster gettin' ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So I approach him and I pause
""Look man I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws
Come messing up this master plan?""
Since he already rowdy I just asked the man, hey
""You want some work, well partna put in ya bid
Now by the was whats your name? They call me Layzie the Kid""
""The names Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlaw everyday on the front page
Mr Kid, if you give me the low down
Me and Blackjack, we ready for the showdown
With two double barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm perdy clever""
So saddle up jump on the bandwagon
Because its all goin' down
I heard a guy run in the bar screaming Krayzie's in town
Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside and dont' be stealin' nobody's damn horses
Stepped inside the bar, Layzie Kid, you son of a gun!
Hey man I'm glad you made it safely
Now let's go have some fun
And this my partner powder hes a young gun
Howdy
Mighty glad to meet ya son
Oh yeah you know I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen the horse peddler
Straggler, just met her
Howdy partner
Already got the horses saddled up
I hope you good at robbing banks
Like you rustle that cattle
Now y'all

I think you right
I say we move come on let's move out!

43,I Don't Want To Miss A Thing,"[Verse 1]
I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping

I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

And I don't want to miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating

REASON
Look this time it's darker nigga
This for the soul
Figure this shit out
Look

[Verse]
It's hard to handle the tragedy God givin' me
I mix revenge with apple juice and Hennessey
Combine that with a lost friend and memories
And there you have it, create a deadly savage
Boy this a story of young'ns who grew up with automatics
That made a living with robbin' like Paula Patton, uh
See this is what happens when there's money demand my nigga, shit
There's always money demands brotha
I done came from the bottom, stuck to the hustle
My niggas like ponytails we came from the struggle
Nigga look how I grew
My nigga shoulder to shoulder with me like crowded rooms
The blessings came raining down like showers do
I accept everything God gave me: The good, bad, the ugly
Lot of work to show a little growth, the flow's scruffy
So when I'm done I rather say I'm deservin' of it than lucky
Reason is standing on his own two
I used to be the guy but now I step out, fly
That's Clark Kent in the phone booth
Workin' hard to say that I got it
Boy, I'm tryna go from Dada to Prada, K-Swiss to Balenciagas
We work hard for most, weren't much given
I came up off Fila jackets and lunch tickets
Going broke, doing music, the grind harder than shell toes
Treat it like velcro, we stuck with it
From a bucket getter to a tough spitter
I earned blessings to duck bitches
Learned lessons, so fuck niggas
Niggas speak behind your back
Don't associate if you even gotta ask did he hate
That's Puff dissin'
Determination like good pussy, I dug in it
And look what came from it
It ain't the best if it ain't got my fuckin' name on it
There you have it",REASON,1998,"[48, 54, 65, 65]",4
45,Wrong Again,"[Verse 1]
It was only
Just a little slow dancing
Just a little romancing
On a Friday night
We shared some drinks
Yeah only a couple
But it sure wasn't nothing
That would change my life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I just knew there was
Nothing to it just
Me and you and a
Quick kiss goodbye

[Chorus]
Wrong again
'Cause your hand's still sitting here in mine
This kiss been going on all night
Look at you baby, look at you
Just goes to show what I thought I knew
Moon's gone but here comes the sunrise
Find myself getting lost in your eyes
Never thought I'd feel something so right
Wrong again

[Verse 2]
It was only just
A couple months dating
Just anticipating
For it to go south
It'd been nothing more
Than anything else
Oh 'cause everybody else
Didn't stick around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I just knew there was
Nothing to it just
Me and you until
We just burned out

[Chorus]
Wrong again
'Cause your hand's still sitting here in mine
This kiss been going on all night
Look at you baby, look at you
Just goes to show what I thought I knew
Moon's gone but here comes the sunrise
Find myself getting lost in your eyes
Never thought I'd feel something so right
Well it looks like I'm wrong again

[Bridge]
I was never ever ever
Absolutely never ever
Gonna hit one knee
And you would never ever ever
Absolutely never ever
Gonna say yes to me

'Cause your hand's still sitting here in mine
This kiss been going on all night
Look at you baby, look at you

46,Husbands And Wives,"[Verse]
Two broken hearts
Lonely looking like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each
Having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives

The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the numbers of husbands and wives

Let's begin with the day I met her
And how fast this good ole boy's world got better
Sky got bluer, the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I'd first seen her

[Verse 2]
Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broke-in sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

[Chorus]
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's right on the money

[Verse 3]
She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothing but net
A hand full of aces, when the dealer's done dealin'
I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feeling

[Chorus]
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's right on the money

[Bridge]
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

[Chorus]
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's

[Outro]

World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins
I continue goin', I get to the boar and
I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'
Then I just yawn and forget to mourn and
Give to the star, it's 6, the reward",Lil Wayne,1998,"[53, 45, 48, 52]",4

I will cross the ocean for you (I will cross the ocean for you)
I will go and bring you the moon
I will be your hero your strength

I will light your way for all time

51,Let Me Let Go,"[Verse 1]
I thought it was over, baby
We said our goodbyes
But I can't go a day without your face
Going through my mind
In fact, not a single minute
Passes without you in it
Your voice, your touch, memories of your love
Are with me all of the time

[Chorus]
Let me let go, baby
Let me let go
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart?
Are you still in my soul?
Let me let go

[Verse 2]
I talked to you the other day
Looks like you make your escape
You put us behind, no matter how hard I try
I can't do the same

[Chorus]
Let me let go, baby
Let me let go
It just isn't right
I've been two thousand miles
Down a dead-end road

[Chorus]
Let me let go, darling, won't you?
I just gotta know, yeah
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart?
Are you still in my soul?
Let me let go

[Bridge]
The lights of this strange city are shining
But they don't hold no fascination for me
I try to find the bright side, baby
But everywhere I look, everywhere I turn
You're all I see

[Chorus]
Let me, let me let go, baby, won't you?
Let me let go
It just isn't right
I've been two thousand miles
Down a dead-end road

[Outro]
Oh, let me let go, darling, won't you?
I just gotta know
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart?
Yeah, you're still in my soul
Let me let go
Let me let go
Let me let go",Faith Hill,1998,"[55, 39, 33, 39]",4
52,When You Believe,"[Verse 1: Whitney Houston]
Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

[Chorus: Whitney Houston]
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston]
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you    believe

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston]
They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small but still resilient voice says, ""Help is very near!""

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston]
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
Now, you will, you will when you believe
You will when you believe, just believe
Just believe, you will when you believe",Whitney Houston,1998,"[56, 53, 53, 51]",4
53,"Spirit Of A Boy, Wisdom Of A Man","He was 16, tender & tough
She was too, & he'd do anything to prove his love

With so much riding on the choice at hand
The spirit of a boy, the wisdom of a man

Hearts caught fire, love ran wild
She cried the day she called to say
She was carrying his child
With so much riding on the choice at hand
The spirit of a boy, the wisdom of a man

It's a constant contradiction
What feels good & what feels right
You live with the decisions you make in your life
And what steers your direction is hard to understand
The spirit of a boy, the wisdom of a man

He drives a diesel out of Dallas
Hauling cars out to the coast
It ain't the dream that he remembers
Just a few short years ago

Tonite at the truck stop he drinks a cup
The waitress grins, winks at him & says
""my shift's almost up""

With so much riding on the choice at hand
The spirit of a boy with a pocket full of plans
And so much riding on the choice at hand

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'""
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
André, got to her station, here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head
For hours, took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group
Ain't comin' with it, but I'm witchya 'cause you probably goin' through it
Anyway, but anyhow, when in doubt
Went on out and bought it 'cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky, awfully
Sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, ""Them niggas earned that crown"", but until then

57,Westside,"Songtekst van Josylvio – ""Westside"" ft. Killer Kamal & 3robi

[Verse 1: Josylvio]
Ik ging van rennen op de streets naar rennen op de beats
Wanneer ze vragen op bureau vertel ik helemaal niets
We blowen smoke in de jeep, roll alleen met de G's
Ze blijven plakken aan m'n body als die bitches me zien
Ik wil een brand new Benz en de banden verbranden
We hebben haast, a mattie
Nee we hebben geen tijd om te wachten
On the road voor die flappen, ik heb een zieke gedachte
Assie is van die zachte, stack niet onder matrassen
De attitude is ma3seb, kon nog weg bij Van Klasse
Maar ik ben real a mattie, hoef geen deal, a mattie
Je mag die voorschot bij je houden, ik ben hier, a mattie
Die rappers praten over gannoes voor de sier, a mattie
Als ik pull up met me jongens is het spel al gewonnen
Rook de hele dag dikke, denk niet eens aan m'n longen
Al die mannen gaan longen wanneer ik kom voor die prijs
Catch je ass wel ergens lacking, alles komt met de tijd

[Hook: Josylvio]
Je kan niet komen waar we staan, met m'n strijder in de laan
Ik geef geen fock om deze faam, ik ben nog steeds de same
We moven undercover, altijd zijn we ready voor cake

Je kan me vinden in de Westside
Je kan me vinden in de Westside

We really shouldn't be doing this and we both know why

This kinda talk will lead us to somewhere
We're getting way too close to going there
The farther off the better to resist, we really shouldn't be doing this

[Verse 1]
Only an isolated incident, but the acquaintance left me stunned
The first attraction was the hardest hit I thought I'd ever overcome
This kinda situation has to pass, this chance encounter has to be the last
To take it further we would be remiss, we really shouldn't be doing this

We'd each be hurting somebody else if we don't say our good-byes real fast
Won't even think about a farewell kiss, we really shouldn't be doing this

In the air tonight
Waiting alone inside for survival
Cruising this place

Brighten up my life tonight
Before the candle flickers

Stand beside me
I will never let you fall
Stand beside me
I'll come whenever you call
I will take it to the wall

Like a rumble fish
Waiting to drown like all of my rivals
Hiding in rooms so hot
To the human touch

Choose your poison if you can
Take this heart of mine and...

If I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers
Just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way
To get to where you are
There's no place that far

It wouldn't matter why we're apart
Lonely months, two stubborn hearts
Nothing short of God above
Could turn me away from your love
I need you that much

If I had to swim a hundred rivers
Just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way
To get to where you are

Who doesn't know what I'm talking about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

[Verse 2]
Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

[Chorus]
She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes

[Verse 3]
She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

[Chorus]
She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes

As her folks drive away her dad yells, ""Check the oil""
Mom stares out the window and says, ""I'm leavin' my girl""
She said, ""It didn't seem like that long ago""
When she stood there and let her own folks know

She needed, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes

Who told the world that I was older?
Who laughed at all I had?
Who said the race was over?

I am a small and gentle man
Who carries the world upon his shoulders
Kindly lend a helping hand...
Come over

And hold onto me
Hold onto me
And hold onto me
Hold on

And my behavior is hard to understand
When I'm like a phone with no connection
But I'm still doin' all I can
To try and get me some redemption
And I'm knee deep in sinking sand
Crying out for your attention
Kindly lend a helping hand
For once defy convention

And hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold on

And hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold on

[Dialogue]
Our task is to transform ourselves
Into awakened multidimensional beings
Thus fulfilling our dream
The 4th and 5th dimensions to the third
It is the inner meaning between Earth ascending and Heaven descending
This sacred magic has already been achieved by many of us
The nameless others are awakening daily
As the cause steadfastly intensifies
We are the claiming of divine birthright and heritage
Remembering that we are angels incarnate;
Vast starried beings of light
We are no longer limited and bound by the illusions of time, space, and matter
We are ready to join as dominations of the one
The doorways cannot be opened or passed by any of us
Still operating as individual units of consciousness
They are brought into manifestation from our unified presence;
Through our focused intent;
Through our total commitment to serving a higher purpose
This is the bridge to an entirely different energy pattern
It is the step beyond the mound dimensional universe
It is a journey into the unknown which shall lead us ever closer to home",Placebo,1998,"[68, 73, 82, 91]",4

Girl, you got me high, just with your eyes
Every word you say, well, it's a lullaby
Pull me inside out
Put me upside down
Silence all of the noise that I can do without

Like the shadows that dance up on the silver screen
And years from now, when I look back
Still under your spell somehow

Help me make the beds in the living room.

Come on down here!

Hey, son!

Big fella. Hey, little guy! Little guy!

Pete's brother and his family are here.

Trish is going to Montreal.

Montreal? Oh, her family's there.

- Then we're off. - When?

- Tomorrow. - You're not ready, are you?

KEVIN:
Mom, Uncle Frank won't let me watch the movie, but the big kids can. Why can't I?

KATE:
Kevin, I'm on the phone. (Back on the phone) When do you come back? Not 'til then?

KEVIN:
It's not even rated R. He's just being a jerk.

KATE:
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no, then it must be really bad. No, we put the dog in the kennel for the-- (Kevin gets on the bed and starts reading a magazine) Hey hey hey, get off! Kevin, out of the room.

KEVIN:
Hang up the phone and make me, why don't ya?

KATE:
This kid.  (Peter enters)

PETER:
Kate, did you pick up a voltage adaptor thing?

KATE:
No, I didn't have time to do that.

KEVIN:
Then how do I shave in France?

KATE:
Grow a goatee.

KEVIN:
Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

PETER:
You don't have anything to do? I have something for you to do. You can pick up those MicroMachines that are all over in there. Aunt Leslie stepped on one of them and almost broke her neck.

KATE:
He was in the garage again playing with the glue gun.

PETER:
Didn't we talk about that?

KEVIN:
Did I burn down the joint? I don't think so. I was making ornaments out of fish hooks.

PETER:
My new fish hooks?

KEVIN:
I can't make them out of old ones, with dry worm guts stuck on them.

KATE:
Peter...?

PETER:
Come on, Kevin. Out. (Peter picks up Kevin; enter Leslie)

LESLIE:
Peter, Kate, do you guys have a voltage adaptor?

PETER:
Here! Here's a voltage adapter! (He gives Kevin to Leslie)

LESLIE:
Oh God, you're getting heavy! (Drops Kevin) Go pack your suitcase.

KEVIN:
Pack my suitcase?

(CUT TO ? AND FULLER DOWNSTAIRS)

?: Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller?

FULLER: I don't live here.

?: I don't believe. in a house with this many people, there's no shampoo.

HARRY:
Are your folks home?

?:
Yeah, but they don't live here. (Walks up the stairs while Tracy walks down; Exit ?) Tracy, did you order the pizza?

TRACY:
Buzz did.

HARRY:
Excuse me, Miss? Are your parents home?

TRACY:
My parents live in Paris, sorry. (Exit Tracy, enter Sondra)

HARRY:
Hi!

Sondra:
Hi!

HARRY:
Are your parents home?

Sondra:
Yeah.

HARRY:
Do they live here?

SONDRA:
No. (Exit Sondra)

HARRY:
No. Why should they? All kids, no parents. Probably a fancy orphanage.

I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I've never done this once in my whole life.

JEFF:
Tough.

KEVIN:
That's what Megan said. (Enter Megan)

MEGAN:
What did I say?

JEFF:
You told Kevin ""Tough.""

MEGAN:
The dope was whining about a suitcase. What was I supposed to say? ""Congratulations, you're an idiot""?

KEVIN:
I'm not an idiot!

MEGAN:
Oh, really? You're completely helpless! Everyone has to do everything for you.

JEFF:
She's right, Kev.

KEVIN:
Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than you. I don't know how to pack a suitcase. (Enter Linnie)

LINNIE:
I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff.

JEFF:
Shut up, Linnie.

KEVIN:
Do you know what I should pack?

JEFF:
Buzz told you, cheek-face. Toilet paper and water. (Exit Jeff)

LINNIE:
Listen, Kevin, what are you so worried about? You know Mom's gonna pack your stuff, anyway. You're what the French call ""les incompetents"".

KEVIN:
What?

(CUT TO JEFF AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS)

JEFF:
Bombs away! (Jeff throws bag that lands right at Harry's feet.)

(CUT TO KEVIN AND LINNIE)

LINNIE:
P.S.: You have to sleep on the hide-a-bed with Fuller. If he has something to drink, he's going to wet the bed. (Exit Linnie)

KEVIN:
This house is so full of people. It makes me sick! When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone! Did you hear me? I'm living alone! I'm living alone!

(CUT TO BUZZ'S ROOM)

ROD:
Who's gonna feed your spider while we're gone?

BUZZ:
He just ate a load of mice guts. He should be good for a couple of weeks. Is it true French babes don't shave their pits?

ROD:
Some don't.

BUZZ:
But they got nude beaches.

ROD:
Not in the winter. (Enter Kevin)

KEVIN:
Buzz?

BUZZ:
Don't you know how to knock, phlegm-wad?

KEVIN:
Can I sleep in your room? I don't want to sleep in the hide-a-bed with Fuller. If he has something to drink, he'll wet the bed.

BUZZ:
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ass. (Buzz looks out the window) Check it out. Old man Marley. (Rod, Kevin, and Buzz watch Old Man Marley outside Buzz's window)

ROD:
Who's he?

BUZZ:
You ever heard of the South Bend Shovel Slayer?

ROD:
No.

BUZZ:
That's him. Back in '58, he murdered his whole family and half the people on his block... with a snow shovel. Been hiding out in this neighborhood ever since.

ROD:
If he's the shovel slayer, how come the cops don't arrest him?

BUZZ:
Not enough evidence to convict. They never found the bodies. But everyone around here knows he did it. It'll just be a matter of time, before he does it again.

ROD:
What's he doing now?

BUZZ:
He walks up and down the street every night, salting the sidewalks.

ROD:
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

BUZZ:
No way. You see that garbage can full of salt? That's where he keeps his victims. The salt turns the bodies into mummies.

ROD:
Wow.

KEVIN:
Mummies! (Old Man Marley looks up)

BUZZ:
Look out! (Buzz closes the drapes)

PIZZA BOY:
Okay, that's $122.50.

HARRY:
Not from me, kid. I don't live here.

PIZZA BOY:
Oh, you just around for the holidays?

I guess you could say that.

Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

PETER:
Yeah.

HARRY:
The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

PETER:

PIZZA BOY:
Good, because somebody owes me $122.50.

HARRY:
I'd like a word with you, sir.

PETER:
Am I under arrest or something?

HARRY:
No, no, no, no. It's Christmas time. There's always a lot of burglaries around the holidays. So we're just checking the neighborhood to see if everyone's taking the proper precautions; that's all.

PETER:
Oh, yeah. Well we have automatic timers for our lights, locks for our doors. That's about as well as anybody can do these days, right? Did you get some eggnog or something like that? (Enter Buzz)

BUZZ: Come on, Dad. Let's eat. (Exit Buzz and Peter)

HARRY: Eggnog? (Enter Kevin) Listen, are you going to be leaving...?

KEVIN: Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

LESLIE:
Frank, you've got money! Come on...

FRANK:
Traveler's checks.

KATE:
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

PETER:
You probably got the checks that don't work in France.

KEVIN:
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

BUZZ:
Oh, yeah, we did. But if you want any, somebody's gonna have to barf it up, because it's gone.

LESLIE:
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

BUZZ:
Kev! Kev, get a plate. (Buzz chokes on the cheese; Kevin pushes him into the table and Buzz barfs)

PETER:
Passports! (Peter spills Pepsi)

Watch it! (Frank's chair is pulled out and hits Fuller; people start to clean up kitchen table quickly)

No, no. Get these passports out of here. (Peter throws away a bunch of napkins, along with Kevin's airline ticket; Leslie picks Fuller up)

LESLIE:
Are you okay, honey? Come here. Are you all right? (Kate grabs Kevin's hand)

KATE:
What is the matter with you?

KEVIN:
He started it! He ate my pizza on purpose. He knows I hate sausage and olives...

Look what you did, you little jerk!

Kevin, get upstairs right now.

KEVIN:
Why?

Kevin, you're such a disease.

KEVIN:
Why do I always get treated like scum?

KATE:
Oh, I'm sorry. This house is just crazy. We've got all these extra kids running around and my brother-in-law drove in from Ohio today. It's just nuts. (Kate hands Pizza Boy money)

KEVIN:
How come you didn't bring more cheese pizzas?

PIZZA BOY:
Nice tip. Thanks a lot. (Exit Pizza Boy, enter Harry)

KATE:
Thanks.

HARRY:
Having a reunion or something?

KATE:
Oh no. My husband's brother transferred to Paris last summer and both of his kids are still going to school here, and I guess he missed the whole family. (Harry smiles at Kevin, showing his gold tooth) He's giving us all this trip to Paris for the holidays, so we can be together.

HARRY:
You're taking a trip to Paris?

KATE:
Yes. We hope to leave tomorrow morning.

HARRY:
Excellent. Excellent.

KATE:
If you'll excuse me, this one's a little out of sorts. I'll be right back. (Kate and Kevin go upstairs)

Don't worry about me. I spoke to your husband already. And don't worry about your home. It's in good hands. (Exit Harry)

KEVIN:
I am upstairs, dummy! (Kate opens the door to the third floor) The third floor?

KATE:
Go.

KEVIN:
It's scary up there.

KATE:
Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.

KEVIN:
I don't want to sleep with Fuller. You know about him: he wets the bed. He'll pee all over me. I know it.

KATE:
Fine, we'll put him somewhere else.

KEVIN:
I'm sorry.

KATE:
It's too late. Get upstairs. (Kevin walks up stairs and stops)

KEVIN:
Everyone in this family hates me.

KATE:
Then maybe you should ask Santa for a new family.

KEVIN:
I don't want a new family. I don't want any family. Families suck!

KATE:
Just stay up there! I don't want to see you again for the rest of the night.

KEVIN:
I don't want to see you again for the rest of my whole life. And I don't want to see anybody else either.

KATE:
I hope you don't mean that. You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow morning and you didn't have a family.

KEVIN:
No, I wouldn't.

KATE:
Then say it again. Maybe it'll happen.

KEVIN:
I hope I never see any of you jerks again. (Kevin walks upstairs, Kate closes the door)

(Kate gets on the phone, hearing a man speaking in French) What am I doing? Oh, hello? Hello? Oh, she'll have to call you back.

ROSE:
Okay, let me connect you with the Family Crisis Intervention.

KATE:
No, this is not a family crisis.

Has he been involved in a household accident?

KATE:
I don't know. I d-- I hope not.

LARRY:
(Takes another bite out of his doughnut) Has the child ingested any poison and/or any other object lodged in his throat?

KATE:
No! He's just home alone! And I'd like somebody to go over to the house to see if he's all right. Just to check on him.

LARRY:
You want us to go to your house, just to check on him?

KATE:
Yes!

LARRY:
Let me connect you to the Police Department.

PETER:
I can't believe you can't bump somebody or ask somebody...

AGENT:
I'm sorry, but there's no way I can do that.

PETER:
Well, isn't there a way like if you ask somebody? I mean, if you brought somebody up here and explained to them that this is an emergency...

AGENT:
I wish I could, but I cannot ask someone... (Enter Kate)

KATE:
They're sending a policeman over to the house to check on Kevin.

PETER:
Well, that's a relief. Everything here is booked.

KATE:
There's nothing to Chicago?

PETER:
There's nothing to Chicago, New York, Nashville, you name it. Everything's gone.

KATE:
What about a private plane?

AGENT:
No, I'm sorry. We don't do that.

PETER:
The only thing is a booking for all of us on Friday morning.

KATE:
Friday morn-- That's two days away.

PETER:
Look, honey. The kids are exhausted. You are exhausted. There's absolutely nothing more that we can do at this airport. Now I say we go over to Rob's, and that way we can call the police again. And they can get back to us.

KATE:
Peter, Kevin is there all by himself. I'm not leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

AGENT:
Madame, we are doing everything we can. Now, if you want to stay at the airport, maybe we can get you on standby. It is a possibility that a seat will open up.

PETER:
Is that okay?

KATE:
Yes. I'll wait.

KEVIN:
Can you please find out?

CASHIER:
Herb.

HERB:

MARV:
Harry, It's our calling card!

HARRY:
Calling card.

MARV:
All the great ones leave their mark. We're the wet bandits.

HARRY:
You're sick, you know? You're really sick.

MARV:
I'm sick...?

HARRY:
Yes, you are.

MARV:
I'm not sick.

HARRY:
It's a sick thing to do!

(CUT TO HARRY AND MARV DRIVING; KEVIN IS WALKING WITH HIS HEAD DOWN)

I saw a hundred kids this week.

MARV:
Let's see what house he goes into. (Harry follows Kevin slowly; Kevin looks back to find Harry and Marv whistling and looking away from him; Kevin starts running; Harry and Marv continue to follow him)

MARV:
Why's he going faster?

HARRY:
I told you something's wrong. See, I knew he looked at me weird. Why would he run? (Kevin disguises himself right outside the church)

MARV:
Maybe he went in the church.

HARRY:
I'm not going in there.

MARV:
Me neither.

(CUT TO ROB'S LIVING ROOM)

MEGAN:
This is so pointless.

BUZZ:
What?

MEGAN:
We're here rotting in this apartment. Kevin's at home. Mom's at the airport.

BUZZ:
So?

MEGAN:
You're not at all worried about Kevin?

BUZZ:
Why should I be? He's acted like a jerk one too many times and this time he caught it in the butt.

MEGAN:
He's so little and helpless. Don't you think he's flipped out?

BUZZ:
The little trout can use a couple of days in the real world.

MEGAN:
You're not at all worried something might happen to him?

BUZZ:
No. For three reasons: A. I'm not that lucky, 2: We have smoke detectors, and D: we live in the most boring street in the United States of American, where nothing even remotely dangerous will ever happen. Period.

Snakes? Snakes. Snakes. I don't know no Snakes.

MARV:
Snakes! Let's get out of here. (Harry is about to start the car)

HARRY:
Hold it. Hold it. Let's wait and see who it is. We work this neighborhood, too. Supposing the cops finger us for a job, and they start asking us questions about a murder in the area. Wouldn't it be nice to have a face to go with their questions?

In Chicago?

No, Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan. They love us--

KATE:
I'm sorry, did you say you could help me?

GUS:
Anyway, I'm rambling on here. Our flight was canceled, so we got to drive. See the guy in the yellow jacket over there? He's going to rent us a nice big van and we're going to drive to Milwaukee. Now, I heard you had some problems getting to Chicago? To see your kid or something?

KATE:
My son. He-- We left, and he's there.

GUS:
Oh, jeez. If you have to get to Chicago, we'll gladly drive you. It's on the way to Milwaukee.

KATE:
You'd give me a ride?

GUS:
Sure we would, why not? You know, you've got to get home to see your kid.

A ride to Chicago?

Shoot.

KEVIN:
I'm Kevin McCallister, 671 Lincoln Blvd. Do you need the phone number?

CHRIS:
No, that's all right.

KEVIN:
Okay, this is extremely important. Would you please tell him that instead of presents this year, I just want my family back. No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate, Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff. And my aunt and my cousins. And if he has time, my Uncle Frank. Okay?

CHRIS:
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

KEVIN:
Thanks. (Turns around)

CHRIS:
Wait. My elf took the last of the candy canes home to her boyfriend.

KEVIN:
That's okay.

CHRIS:
No, don't be silly. Everybody who sees Santa has got to get something. Here, hold out your little paw there. (Chris gives Kevin 3 tic-tacs) There you go. Don't spoil your dinner.

KEVIN:
I won't. Thanks. (Exit Kevin; Chris starts his car and starts to drive off, but he gets stuck)

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Merry Christmas. (Kevin has a confused look on his face) May I sit down? (Kevin nods; Old Man Marley sits down) There's my granddaughter up there. The little red-haired girl. She's about your age. You know her?

KEVIN:
No.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You live next to me, don't you? (Kevin nods) You can say hello when you see me. You don't have to be afraid. There's a lot of things going around about me, but none of it's true. Okay? (Kevin nods) You've been a good boy this year?

KEVIN:
I think so.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You swear to it?

KEVIN:
No.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I had a feeling. Well, this is the place to be if you're feeling bad about yourself.

KEVIN:
It is?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I think so.

KEVIN:
Are you feeling bad about yourself?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
No.

KEVIN:
I've been kind of a pain lately. I said some things I shouldn't have. I really haven't been too good this year.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Yeah.

KEVIN:
I'm kind of upset because I really like my family, even though sometimes I say I don't. Sometimes I even think I don't. Do you get that?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I think so. How you feel about your family is a complicated thing.

KEVIN:
Especially with an older brother.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Deep down, you'll always love him. But you can forget that you love him. You can hurt them, and they can hurt you. That's not just because you're young. You want to know the real reason why I'm here right now?

KEVIN:
Sure.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I came to hear my granddaughter sing. And I can't come hear her tonight.

KEVIN:
You have plans?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
No. I'm not welcome.

KEVIN:
At church?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You're always welcome at church. I'm not welcome with my son. Years back, before you and your family moved on the block, I had an argument with my son.

KEVIN:
How old is he?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
He's grown up. We lost our tempers, and I said I didn't care to see him anymore. He said the same, and we haven't spoken to each other since.

KEVIN:
If you miss him, why don't you call him?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I'm afraid if I call that he won't talk to me.

KEVIN:
How do you know?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I don't know. I'm just afraid he won't.

KEVIN:
No offense, but aren't you a little old to be afraid?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You can be a little old for a lot of things. You're never too old to be afraid.

KEVIN:
That's true. I've always been afraid of our basement. It's dark, there's weird stuff down there, and it smells funn; that sort of thing. It's bothered me for years.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Basements are like that.

KEVIN:
I made myself go down to do some laundry, and I found out it's not so bad. All this time I've been worried about it, but if you turn on the lights, it's no big deal.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
What's your point?

KEVIN:
My point is, you should call your son.

OLD MAN MARLEY
What if he won't talk to me?

KEVIN:
At least you'll know. Then you could stop worrying about it. Then you won't have to be afraid anymore. I don't care how mad I was, I'd talk to my dad ad. Especially around the holidays.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I don't know.

KEVIN:
Just give it a shot, for your granddaughter anyway. I'm sure she misses you, and the presents.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I send her a check.

KEVIN:
I wish my grandparents did that. They always send me clothes. Last year I got a sweater with a big bird knitted on it.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Oh, that's nice.

KEVIN:
Not for a guy in the second grade. You can get beat up for something like that.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Oh?

KEVIN:
Yeah. I have a friend who got nailed because there was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You better run along home where you belong. Think about what I said. All right?

KEVIN:
Okay.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
It's nice talking to you.

KEVIN:
Nice talking to you. (Old Man Marley and Kevin shake hands) What about you?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Me?

KEVIN:
Yeah. You and your son.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
We'll see what happens. Merry Christmas.

Wait, wait. Just what he wants us to do: is go back downstairs through his fun house so we get all tore up.

And we're going to smash his face with an iron. (Enter Old Man Marley with a shovel)

You're not. You know, You're beating yourself up there, you know. This happens. These things happen, you know. Gee, you want to talk about bad parents? Look at us. We're on the road 48, 49 weeks a year. We hardly see our families. You know, Joe, over there. Gosh, you know, he forgets his kids' names half the time. Ziggy over there, he's never even met his kid. Eddy: let's just hope none of them write a book about him.

KATE:
Tell me, have you gone on vacation and left your child home?

GUS:
No. But I did leave one at a funeral parlor once. Yeah, it was terrible, too. I was all distraught and everything. The wife and I, we left the little tyke there in the funeral parlor all day. All day. You know, we went back at night, when we came to our senses, there he was. Apparently, he was there all day with a corpse. Now, he was okay. You know, after 6, 7 weeks. He came around and started talking again. But he's okay. They get over it. Kids are resilient like that.

Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.

I set my mind to it said I wasn't going to do it

Going to keep my guard up and save it for another

Got lost in your eyes and flew right out the door

Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
Uh, yeah
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest

[Verse 1]
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it
Bastards ducking when B.I.G. be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my back room fucking
It ain't nothing
They know B.I.G. be handling
With the MAC in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen, they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q
Forty-five by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like Dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya but I have to
You see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame
And them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot? Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable

B-I-G, G-I-E
A-K-A., B-I-G
Get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appétit
Rappers can't sleep need sleeping
B.I.G. keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A: Don't fuck with B-I
That's that ""Oh I, thought he was wack""
Oh, come, come now, why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer sauté, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
""He sounds demented""
Car weed scented, if I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil, or unbelievable

[Verse 3]
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here
I damage and tear, MC's fear me
They too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable

72,Believe,"[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will

73,Father Of Mine,"Father of mine
Tell me where have you been?
You know I just closed my eyes
My whole world disappeared
Father of mine
Take me back to the day
Yeah, when I was still your golden boy
Back before you went away

I remember blue skies walking the block
I loved it when you held me high
I loved to hear you talk
You would take me to the movie
You would take me to the beach
You would take me to a place inside
That's so hard to reach

Oh!
Father of mine
Tell me where did you go?
Yeah, you had the world inside your hand
But you did not seem to know
Father of mine
Tell me what do you see?
When you look back at your wasted life
And you don't see me

I was ten years old
Doin' all that I could
It wasn't easy for me to be a scared white boy
In a black neighborhood
Sometimes you would send me a birthday card
With a five dollar bill
I never understood you then
And I guess I never will

And the world disappeared

Tell me how do you sleep?
With the children you abandoned
And the wife I saw you beat

I will never be safe
I will never be sane
I will always be weird inside
I will always be lame
Now I'm a grown man
With a child of my own
And I swear, I'll never let her know
All the pain I have known

74,When A Woman's Fed Up,"[Verse 1]
I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying ""damn"" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

[Chorus]
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
(Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

[Verse 2]
Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around

[Chorus]
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
Running out of love
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

La da da da da la la da da
La da da da da la la da da
Whoa, listen...
If you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays

[Chorus]
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
Mama taught me a long time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it (Oh no, oh no)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

[Outro] (throughout repeating chorus)
""You can cry a river
'Til an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you""
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago

Yes, it was and I miss her

I said I miss you baby",R. Kelly,1998,[79],1
75,What It's Like,"[Verse 1]
We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange
He ask the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
""Get a job, you fucking slob"" is all he replies

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

[Verse 2]
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
He said. ""Don't worry about a thing, baby doll
I'm the man you've been dreamin' of.""
But three months later he said he won't date her or return her calls
And she sweared, ""Goddamn, if I find that man, I'm cuttin' off his balls!""
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door:
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore!

[Hook 2]
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

[Bridge]
I've seen a rich man beg
I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad
And the down side of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon
Drank from the golden cup
Smoked the finest green

I stroked the baddest dimes
At least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart

You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start

[Verse 3]
I knew this kid named Max
He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late at night
Liked to get shit faced
And keep pace with thugs

Until late one night there was a big gunfight
Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45
Talked some shit
And wound up dead

Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way
At least that's what they say
When you play the game

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
To have to lose...",Everlast,1998,"[80, 83]",2

Do you think about me cause I don’t have any doubt
You must in this life
Even though you’re never there, I didn’t feel you disappear
From sight, you did it well

[Chorus]
And now you and I share the same life missin' out
And so the story goes
That we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
I know that if I
I had the chance, I’d let you know that I understand
I’ve let you go

I don’t need you by my side I think by now I’m doin' fine
Myself, on my own
And I feel you time to time, like you're sending out a sign
I can tell you're not alone

Because you and I share the same life missin' out

80,Back 2 Good,"[Verse 1]
It's nothing, it's so normal
You just stand there
I could say so much
But I don't go there because I don't want to
I was thinking if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

[Chorus]
Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking about
Somebody else
Well, it's best if we all keep this under our heads
I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But I'm lonely now
And I don't know how
To get it back to good

[Verse 2]
This don't mean that, you own me, well
This ain't no good, in fact it's phony as hell
Yeah, but things worked out just like you wanted too
If you see me out, you don't know me
Try to turn your head, try to give me some room
Oh, to figure out just what I'm going to do

[Chorus 2]
Because everyone here, hates everyone here for doing
Just like they do
And It's best if we all keep this quiet instead
And I couldn't tell, why everyone here was doing me like they do
But I'm sorry now, and I don't know how
To get it back to good
Everyone here, is wondering what it's like to be with
Somebody else
And everyone here's to blame, and everyone here
Gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain, well everyone hides
Shades of shame, yeah but looking inside we're the same
We're the same
And we're all grown now, yeah, but we don't know how
To get it back to good

[Chorus 3]
Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking 'bout
Somebody else
And it's best if we all keep this under our heads
I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But it's over now, yeah and I don't know how, because it's over now
There's no getting back to good",Matchbox Twenty,1998,[85],1

Somebody you really don't wanna be with
And others left to figure it out

[Verse 1: Case]
She was more than a women, a goddess for all it seems
All I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were cool and the groovin' love was on
But I still remember how it felt when our love was gone

[Chorus 1]
In a tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago
(Secret memories in her mind)
Secret memories in her mind
How could love be so unkind?
Heartbreak time (my heart is breaking)

[Chorus 2]
Faded pictures in a broken glass (broken glass)
Like a mirror revealing (I see... I see)
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past? (way back long ago)
'Cause it's breaking my heart
To watch her stare into the glass (Joe help me out!)

[Verse 2: Joe]
As she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face
I could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way
Then she stopped and she came to a page where her diary ends
To smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose

[Chorus 1]
In a tattered picture book (tattered picture book)
Was a photograph she took (she took) years ago
(Secret memories in her mind)
Secret memories in her mind, (oh oh)
How could love be so unkind? (unkind)
Heartbreak time

Faded pictures in a broken glass (Oh baby)
Like a mirror revealing (Like a mirror revealing)
What the woman is feeling
(was it someone from a distant past?)
Was it someone from a distant past? (Oh oh)
'Cause it's breaking my heart (it's breaking my heart)
To watch her stare into the glass (stare into the glass)

[Interlude (x2)]
(Oh na na na na)
Just keep spinning
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
'Cause she's lost inside the past

(lost inside the past)

Faded pictures in a broken glass (in a broken glass)
Like a mirror revealing (I feel it)
What the woman is feeling

I met up with an acrobat
In Brooklyn or some place like that
With life and taxis flying past
We tore that dance hall down

[Verse 2]
Pocket change and subway cars
Our big ideas filled empty bars
You might be from the moon or Mars
Either way, I'm never going home

[Pre-Chorus]
So, let's hang an anchor from the sun
There’s a million city lights but

You're the reason I’m still
Up at dawn
Just to see your face
We'll be going strong
With the vampires, baby
We belong, we belong awake

[Verse 3]
I was drinking from the wishing well
Some junkie metal-head hotel
When we boarded the carousel
The roof was caving in

[Verse 4]
On the stage, my Oxblood friend
Was singing songs about the end
The bankers in the lion's den
Were dropping lines like beggars in the snow

[Pre-Chorus]
So, let's hang an anchor from the sun
There’s a million city lights but

84,My Little Secret,"[Intro: JD]
See baby you're my little secret
If you don't tell, I won't tell
And that's how we gotta keep it

[Verse 1: Kandi]
Did anybody see you coming to my house last night?
When I got your message on my beeper
That you wanna do everything I like
Alright, alright

[Pre-Chorus: LaTocha]
I like being in the same room as you and your girlfriend
The fact that she don't know
That really turns me on
She'll never guess in a million years
That we've got this thing going on

[Chorus]
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
It's on everybody's mind, about you and I
They think so, but they don't really know
Or wanna know that
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
We should never let 'em know
Never let it show
If you know, like I know
We should never let it go

[Verse 2: Tiny]
If anybody knew that it was you and your house
That I was creepin' to all the time
I'd probably still do it
Cause I find it hard to keep you off of my mind

[Break: Kandi]
Everybody cheats
But you gotta know how, you gotta know when
You gotta know why my infatuation with you
Is taking me on an emotional high

Still the truth I can't reveal

You ain't never gonna be by yourself
Cause the love that we share
It stays on my mind

Standing in the spotlight
On such a perfect night
Knowing that your out there listening
I remember one time
When I was so afraid
Didn't think I had the courage
To stand up on this stage
Then you reached into my heart
And you found the melody
And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
It was you
It was you

It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song

Every night I pray
Before the music starts to play
That I'll do my best and I won't let you down
And for all the times I've stood here
This feeling feels brand new
And any time I doubt myself I think of you

[Chorus]
Because It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong

Someone crossed that yellow line
The day we laid 'em in the ground
Is the day I lost my mind
Right now I'm down to holdin'
This little cardboard sign

Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes, we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings

That town will always be you
And in every crowd on every corner

I drove away without looking back

Going anywhere as fast as I can

Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you

These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are

Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of the breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
But I'm still a far cry from gone

Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you

92,Can't Get Enough,"[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World, Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know

“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr

When do you say ""I do""
When is the perfect time
To spend the rest of your life
Seasons may come and go
Sometimes it rains and snows
And there will be highs and lows
So only you will know

You never know just where it will find you
'Cause it can come on you so fast
Or seems like it takes forever
When you want it so bad
But don't ever take it for granted
'Cause it's more than sowing some seeds
It takes sun and water
So give it what it needs

That's how you fall in love
That's when you say ""I do""
That's when you know its time

From the block to the cages
You our main inspiration when we rockin' on stages
We came a little way from beats in the basements
Stick-up kids, throw the heat to your faces
And even though we don't be meetin' them cases
But we stuck on these chases to get these papers
And the system is ancient, we dishin' the haters
Wishin' that our Clik never make it, but

There are times when I see you talking to other girls
I feel insecure
And every time I see you walking out
I wonder if you're coming back to me

You tell me I've got nothing to worry about
They've got nothing on me
You tell me I'm a good girl and you know it
Are you so strong, or is the weakness in me?

I've never had someone like you
Who makes me feel the way you do
Sometimes I believe that I might die
If I lost you
If I lost you
If I lost you

Fears formed so long ago
So stupid to hold on to them all
Not every man is made the same
So unevolved to think that way

Sometimes I believe that I might die
If I lost you
If I lost you

Does the darkness help when you lie down with the truth?

Do you see me when you close your eyes?
How do you sleep at night?

We live together separately
We don't want to fall apart
But every time we kiss there's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

How did we lose it, why did this happen
When did we take it all for granted
We sit in silence, inside we're cryin'
How can we keep our love from dyin'

108,Time After Time,"[Verse 1]
Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after—
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow.""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
See, I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame
But maybe you misunderstood

Wanna change something that's so good

And try to understand why

I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine

116,Just The Two Of Us,"[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
Come on Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada musta runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch – it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 2]
See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
‘Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out!
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear  (Mama!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free — whee! (woosh!)
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restrainin' order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her (Mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us

And when we ride

Just you and I

[Outro]
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your dada will always be there for you

117,When The Lights Go Out,"[Verse 1: Slug]
Do you remember that knife you wouldn't part with?
You  kept it sharp just to carve my fuckin' heart like a park bench
Well I found it this morning in a Southside bus stop
And I'm smiling for this mugshot
That's when I knew the plan was bound to fail
By the time you hear the song I'll be singing it from down at county jail
Still filled to the maximum
So fuck Bill Clinton with his saxophone
And cut, I'm trying to follow a lit fuse
I must have missed a day's allowance of fish food
Like who's tit do you think that this is dude?
She ain't your bitch to misuse
And when there ain't nothing more to grab
I might give something back to the floor of this cab
I might tag my name on the door of your building
Might even make a couple of your children
When all the lights go out

[Hook: Slug + Kool Keith + (MF DOOM)]

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Click is when he go in, we keeps it flowin'
Wrote this poem from a swollen place of deep knowin'
Winter showin', we scared of the dark as night approaches
Until a time comes, some run like roaches
Stop, drop, pop a slug out the mag, tag
Thug it out, brag, hold on to your bug out bag
When he's out on tour [of bowser?] and the drink go down
Grab your girl, he might arouse her — yowzers
What dreams may come
Some plot and scheme on the scene, he play dumb
From the load out, true emissary who forever ready
Ask your secretary 'bout the melonberry
It's elementary, fedora or the ski hat
Drawers or Dungaree slacks, where you gonna be at?
Don't repeat that, she ain't the type no doubt
If she wanna eat it's goin' right in her mouth

[Mia X]
I tried to feed you everything you needed
And if I wrote I love you in the sky, you probably wouldn't read it
Cause, you actin like it don't even matter no more
Sometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin to make it to the door
Is it that I bore you, is it someone else again?
Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friends
I'm tryin to be mature, but mentally, I'm so tired
And you can't even tell me why
I cry feelin stupid, used and alone
When it's four in the mornin and you still not home
Where did we go wrong, it used to be all gravy
Makin love all night, callin me your baby
But things got shady, now we ain't even close
Treat me like I should leave, and then don't want me to go
Sometimes I think I'm stuck, ?some say we goin on that path?
And then you raise me on the phone and please let you come back
Whatcha Wanna Do?

[Chorus:  Charlie Wilson]
Cause my heart is yearnin for your love

Now we been through all kinds of drama
But I'm the only other woman who loves you just as much as mama
I'm tryin to hold on, cause what we had was so deep
And in relationships, you got to take the bitter with the sweet
You keep runnin in and out, messin with my feelings
Playin with my mind and I know you see me trying
But even soldiers fall, remember when you fell
Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin me your ex
Can't keep runnin in and out
Can't keep runnin

When everything was so right

122,All My Life,"[Intro]
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

[Verse 1]
Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I've got nothing to hide
On and on, I've got nothing to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste

Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, motherfuck the fag
Well anyway, I did pick ups, lift and click-ups
Too many stick-ups, cause niggas had the trigger hiccups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip with just a clip, who wanna hit
They got 'em quick, I had to eat, this money's good as spent
A 'do in braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the lead to any telling crackhead
I'd still'a been broke, so a lot of good it woulda did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none
Why did I have to live a life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played I was a sad one
And always wanted to live like this or that one

[Verse 2: Treach]
A ghetto bastard, born next to the projects
Living in the slums with bums, I said, ""now why, Treach""
""Do it have to be like this""
Momma said I'm priceless
So I am all worthless, starved, and it's just what being nice gets
Sometimes I wish I could afford a pistol then, though
To stop the hell, I would've ended things a while ago
I ain't have jack but a black hat and knapsack
War scars, stolen cars, and a blackjack
Drop that, and now you want me to rap and give?
Say something positive?
Well positive ain't where I live
I live right around the corner from West Hell
Two blocks from South Shit and once in a jail cell
The sun never shone on my side of the street, see
And only once or twice a week I would speak
I walked alone, my state of mind was home sweet home
I couldn't keep a girl, they wanted kids with cars and chrome
Some life, if you ain't wear gold your style was old
And you got more juice and dough for every bottle sold
Hell no, I say there's gotta be a better way
But hey, never gamble in a game that you can't play
I'm slowin' and flowin' and going in on and knowing not now
How will I do it, how will I make it
I won't, that's how
Why me, huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Treach]
My third year into adulthood, and still a knucklehead
I'm better off dead huh, that's what my neighbor said
I don't do jack but fighting, lightin' up the streets at night
Playing hide-and-seek with a machete sexing Freddy's wife
Some say I'm rolling on, nothing but a dog now
I answer that with a ""fuck you"" and a bow-wow
Cause I done been through more shit within the last week
Than a fly flowing in doo-doo on the concrete
I been a deadbeat, dead to the world and dead wrong
Since I was born that's my life, oh you don't know this song
So don't say jack, and please don't say you understand
All that man-to-man talk can walk, damn
If you ain't live it, you couldn't feel it, so kill it skillet
And all that talk about it won't help it out, now will it?
In Illtown, pure luck got stuck-up, props got shot
Don't worry got hit by a flurry, and his punk-ass dropped
But I'm the one who has been labeled as an outcast

But that's cool with the fool, smack 'em backwards

126,How's It Going To Be,"[Verse 1: Stephan Jenkins]
I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I want to get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm going to miss

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

[Bridge: Stephan Jenkins]
And how's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
And how's it going to be
Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion (Oblivion)

I don't like when, you know, I'm in a club

And I'm with my honey

They wanna be tough guys all of a sudden

Little do they know, the girl roll harder than
Some of yo' niggas
You dig?

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now what the hell is you lookin' for?
Can't a young man get money anymore?
Let my pants sag down to the floor
Really do it matter as long as I score?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors?
I was Murda, P. Diddy made me pretty
Did it for the money, now can you get with me?
People wanna know who is he, he get busy
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy
Niggas on the block know Mase motto
One thing about Harlem World, we all got dough
'98 Tahoe, Tommy and a Roscoe
Case I'm ever chased by Donnie Brasco

Yo, I can't get mad 'cause you look at me
'Cause on the real, look at me
Yo, it always be the haters that be sittin' in the rear
Dissin' every year, but they better listen here
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on your own
'Cause bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone
Plus it won't be long 'til they send me the dome
Sit gently, while I'm on the Bentley phone
Why you don't like me? 'Cause I'm mad fly and icy?
And why you can't satisfy your wifey
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure
CD, TV's, really would I know ya?
Now me and Blink float in a gold Rover
So it's only right you get the cold shoulder
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed
'Cause Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it

We was all at the Greek Fest, it's hot and sandy

Who look good enough to be Miss Miami
But say since some her peeps call her Candy
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's
""He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties?""
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties?
Please, tell me something that I don't know
Like if we have sex, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem you can meet me at 10

129,If You Could Read My Mind,"[Verse 1]
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

[Verse 2]
If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind that drugstores sell
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take

[Verse 3]
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back

[Verse 4]
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelin's that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it

This song is dedicated
To all the up and coming rappers, singers, hustlers, actors
Whatever you may be remember:
Without no struggle, you get no progress
So keep grindin, keep on mashin, get yours

[Chorus: Gerald Levert]
You're nothin far from comin up (keep on)
Money's just a touch away (keep on)
So keep on grindin don't give it up (keep on)
There'll always be another day (keep on)

[Mack 10]
And now I'm sittin at the pad, teary eyed and depressed
Starvin and sufferin from mental stress
Now a true center to the game of beginner
But hard to feel like a winner when you eat spreads for dinner
Hit the streets late night in the form of star mushin
On the 211 mission just to pay tuition
For my kids I got to grind and develop street savvy
Servin stress cause I just ain't got enough to cop cavi
But I can't stop, I won't stop, til I got it made
Either build my clientele, get a job or learn a trade
Like hip-hop, and make enough to live good forever
So I learned to write the rhymes and get my metaphors together
Then I joined a rap crew, with the homies on my street
Sellin underground tapes out the local swap meet
Gettin tighter on the mic, as I worked day to day
So now I lay down at night, and I hear voices say, ""Mack""

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
Now I'm new to the scene, H as in Hard, N as in Nympho
So like EPMD, could you _Please Listen to My Demo?_
I left the local crew, felt like I was the man
In popular demand and now ready for SoundScan
So I searched for a deal with no luck I kept rappin
Felt like it would take a miracle to make it all happen
Marble said it was a test, ""Mack don't do nuttin wrong!
Just have faith in God and keep your hustle goin strong
Stay hongry, keep writin, don't quit you're too close
Remember good things come to those who want it most""
So I never left the house, without my rap book
Thought I found a new crew but eventually got shook
First they said I was cool, but then started to doubt me
Put me on the backburner and just forgot all about me
Partna said I wasn't fresh, and sent me on my way, but you know what?
As I was leavin, I could hear voices say, ""Mack""

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
Now the tables turned, but I remember they used to clown me
The hard work paid off, and luck finally found me
So call every publication, Billboard and the editor
And tell em Mack's being signed by dude workin on _The Predator_
I got the Midas touch, now everything be the bomb
Hooked up with The Don, now made a few mill-ion
I don't bang I write the good rhymes, you know about mines
Man I'm the tightest MC, Ice Cube ever signed
Now if ain't the radio, it's a video shoot
Livin life in the limelight, with a bank full of loot
Now my crew is solid, shook the haters and the leeches
Runnin full court at my house with our girls on the beaches
Plus the violence is ceased, no more bi-coastal beef
Cause now I get down with the North South and the East
I reminisce on hard times, seem like yesterday, but now
Hoo Bangin' is official and I remember they used to say, ""Mack""

[Chorus]

[Levert] Money's just a touch, just a simple touch
Money's just a touch away..
Money's just a touch, just a simple touch
Money's just a touch away..

Pimping hard with a female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family

136,Don't Let It Go To Your Head,"[Produced by Chris Liggio]

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
Now a lot of people think this is easy as it looks
Books and books of rhyme concepts and hooks
Session to session to get thoughts manifested
Stressin' and stressin' to hit the world with a blessin'
Lot of people often ask, ""Puba how you givin' back?""
The way I give back is through the knowledge of my raps
Like a gem, for all my people caught out on a limb
Who be givin' in, caught out on a stem, who don't wanna win
""I'm feelin' you, I know you gettin' down like that
But what I'm sayin' dog is let me hold a little somethin', black
""I'll hit you back!"" C'mon, dead that, that's the tenth time
I heard that—all you know is gimme I work hard for every penny
That I make—video and tape
LP and CD, if I fall, you feedin me?
No dough to spread, always keep a level head
Long as my seeds get fed, it won't go to my head, so

[Hook]
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Everybody love a star when he on top
""Don't, don't let it go your head, no!""
Nobody comes around when the star starts to drop
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Strive to help others who help themselves
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!""
Knowledge of self, and good health and wealth

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
The ladies a dame, no question but you can’t tell her that
Cuz sometimes she speed and put her hand out
Like I'm that ATM nigga, drop me off at Chase
Earring in her naval like she sexual
She royalty but her whole loyalty to smoke
Get wrecked in the kitchen like she run the cooking channel
And then hide the heat in the car door
Goddamn she’s a mother to be, I’m hoping twins
Give me a whole tribe
And be as sexy as Janet was on the cover of Vibe
She slick talk, threaten to walk
She got a girlfriend I used to tap back when, so she always worry and bitches
I tell her hold it down ma I give you high ranks
Sometimes you wild but I guess that's your style
If you lay up in my high-rise, will you stay wise?
Will I slay thighs? Open your eyes, girl

[Hook]
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Don't believe those jealous-type cats
""Don't, don't let it go your head, no!""
Cause I'm the one makin' some late night cash
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
I told you girl my home is my castle
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!""
Understand it won't be no hassle

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
I heard your single on the battle of the beats
It won five nights, I bet you had the time of your life
Workin' so hard and so long to make a record
Finally to make a song people respected
Collect the dough at a show as you sip the Mo'
Now you hittin' the flow, you never hit befo'
That's a trip, how much better could it get?
Got the leather with the work check, all up in the whip
They're all legitimate, callin' it what it's really not
This is just one single you got, that's really hot
Tomorrow it could bust just like a blood clot
Leave you in the dust with your body to rot
Another party to rock, if it's you or if it's me
It doesn't matter cause it just won't stop
Don't let your gray matter pop
Cause when you release the album
If they don't cop, you gonna get dropped, so

[Hook]
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Cause one single don't make you a hit
""Don't, don't let it go your head, no!""
Stay true to who you are, don't never forget
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Keep your feet on solid ground
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!""
Cause what goes up, must come down, uh

[Outro]
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
""Don't, don't let it go your head, no!""
""Don't let it go your head, no!""

[Verse 1: Mike D]
Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around, I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style, profile

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock]
I said it always brings me back when I hear, ""ooh child""
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathons 'til the very last mile

[Verse 3: MCA]
Well, if you battle me, I will revile
People always saying my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile (guile)
To step to me, I’m a rapophile

[Verse 4: Mike D]
If you wanna battle, you're in denial
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead; put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exile

[Chorus]
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

[Verse 5: Ad-Rock]
Jazz and AWOL, that's our team
Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream

[Verse 6: MCA]
Well, I gotta keep it going, keep it going full steam
Too sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean
Well, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I will plot and scheme

[Verse 7: Mike D]
Mario C likes to keep it clean (clean)
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rapping, 'cause that's my dream
Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes

[Verse 8: Ad-Rock]
Now when it comes to envy, ya'll is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine)
Another dimension, new galaxy
Intergalactic planetary

[Chorus]
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

[Verse 9: MCA]
We're from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
'Cause the music is live, like an electric shock

[Verse 10: Mike D]
I am known to do the wop (wop)
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D getting biz on the crop (crop)
Beatsie Boys known to let the beat
""MMM, D-r-r-rop!""
Do it

[Verse 11: Ad-Rock]
Now when I wrote graffiti, my name was Slop
If my rap's soup, my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack, DJ Adrock

[Verse 12: MCA]
If you try to knock me, you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock

[Chorus]
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

139,Perfect,"[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight",Ed Sheeran,1998,"[64, 63, 59, 55, 54, 54]",6
140,Music Sounds Better With You,"[Verse 1]
Man, I keep it one thousand
Mine is higher than a mountain
Haters just wait for my album
'Cause I feel that it might corral them
Now, I'm so bad that I wrote the damn book
My old hood loves me, shout to Blackwood
First the heads shook and then the hands shook
In my presence, guess I am just that good
And they sook, ""No fair, his hair's long
Looks like he's on heroin, how'd he get on?""
I'm a phenom so use your melon
I wipe the floor with you 'til the smell's gone
Smoking that fresh lawn
Kill your whole buzz and then yawn
All CP and your soul needs me
So I'm here, Mr. Alldeezy, go

[Hook]
Ooh, baby, I feel right
The music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

[Verse 2]
Man, I keep it one trillion
Hotter than a fucking Brazilian
Watch the throne my bum's sitting in
I'm not like you, I'm much different
I'm Prince Charles, maybe a little Manson
My appearance may be a little Hansen
Tryna be in a mansion, real accent
Work hard and your dreams will happen
I'm still lappin' dudes in the rat race
Writing these raps in my bat cave
Now tell me how my goddamn sack tastes
I just want stacks like pancakes
Uh, what the hell should I tell them?
When do I relent? Seldom
Tryna make good songs and sell them
Hipsters rhyme better, hmm, you're welcome

[Hook]
Ooh, baby, I feel right
The music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

[Verse 3]
And I'm back for the third time
And a motor on in the turbine
A lot of people that I've heard rhyme
But really I prefer mine and
I write like this in a deep sleep
And you all talk gas like BP
And I bought your bogus CD
I'm just glad that I kept my receipt
See, '90s clothes are my favourite
But my flows are not that dated
And the hate from afar don't say shit
'Bout to take it, I'm impatient
I'll take the win and take losses
Go spark a leaf or blaze forest
And all the eyes stay on us
Take off like my nickname's Qantas

[Hook]
Ooh, baby, I feel right
The music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good, I feel right
The music sounds better with you",Allday,1998,"[65, 70, 69, 62, 70, 71, 71, 84]",8
141,Goodbye To My Homies,"[Intro: Master P]
RIP homie, RIP

[Intro: Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick]
How do I say goodbye to what we had
The good times that made us that outweighed the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to my homies

[Verse 1: Master P]
Y'all need to smile for my ghetto heroes nigga
So many homies gone, trying to ball till they fall
Now I'm left with nothing but old cards
And a bunch of pictures on the wall
RIP tatoos nigga, just to show you that we real
But I still can't believe that your dead fool, and how you got killed
And on your birthday me and my boys visit your grave
And I remember when you first got high
And the first time you got laid
And I'm going through a thing, Kevin nigga, what should I do
I never imagined living life without a nigga like you

[Chorus: Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick]
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies

[Verse 2: Master P]
We shed so many ghetto tears, see time is crazy
And every Sunday grandma go to church
She said she gotta pray for her baby
And ah, your little son, he look just like you
And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through
And ah, me, C and Silkk, we got all the money but that don't mean shit
Cause I burn all that shit up nigga, just to have you again
And it's real out here, all you niggas that's goin through some pain
Keep your head up, and this for everybody
That lost a relative in the street game

[Chorus: Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick]
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies

[Silkk The Shocker]
Now look, I couldn't imagine life without you
I just sit here wonderin' why
But the law of life, and god placed us here
And said everybody must die
Ain't it hard trying to move on, but still I try
Even though we got money, judgment day
Just some things we can't buy
Even though you gone, I never let you move on
Cause every time I think about you
I sit back and write your name in a song
Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt
It's kinda spooky when I see your face on a t-shirt
I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better
And watch it, 'cause death or funerals bring our family together
Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father
Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them
You'll never know when they'll be here tomorrow

142,I Had No Right,"God of the poor man, this is how the day began
Eight codefendants, I, Daniel Berrigan
Oh and only a layman's batch of napalm
We pulled the draft files out
We burned them in the parking lot
Better the files than the bodies of children

I had no right but for the love of you
I had no right but for the love of you

Many roads led here, walked with the suffering
Tom in Guatamala, Phillip in New Orleans
Oh it's a long road from law to justice
I went to Vietnam
I went for peace, they dropped their bombs
Right where my government knew I would be

I had no right but for the love of you
I had no right but for the love of you

And all my country saw
Were priests who broke the law

First it was question, then it was a mission
How to be American, how to be a Christian
Oh if their law is their cross and the cross is burning

The love of you
The love of you

God of the just I'll never win a peace prize
Falling like Jesus, now let the jury rise
Oh it's all of us versus all that paper
They took the only way
They know who is on trial today
Deliver us unto each other, I pray

I had no right but for the love of you
And every trial I stood, I stood for you

Eyes on the trial

Always loyal from the instant that you walked my way
Always down for whatever, I got you baby
I got you fiending for me
It's really appealing to me
So that I reveal and flaunt it

Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with a lot of butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's okay if she got cash

Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

I'll tell 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin' but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feeling right
Do the same damn thing every day of my life
Cause every morning you know I get
A good blowjob from a real fine bitch
Strokin', smokin', sir Too $hort
Thinking about the day before
30 minutes after I rolled out
I pulled a freak took her to my house
She was hella young with a lot of butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy I couldn't pass
A light-skined freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin' away
I wanna do the same thing again today
Today my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself ""I must need glasses""
Where's them bitches with the big round asses
Me and me homie just wanna be tuff
Freak two bitches then switch'em up
It was 3:35 the strip was lit
Every two blocks I saw a different bitch
Waiting on the bus some was walking
Me and my homie just started talking
I said ""Homie she looks good""
He said ""That ass is flat as wood""
I said ""What about baby in the black""
And he said ""$hort she's all back""

For every nigga living there's a freak
If you got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cause bitches all over wanna get fucked
I just need one with a lot of butt
Me and my homie rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie ""I hate to say
All the bitches with ass stayed home today""
And he said ""$hort what now?""
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind

Bitches, Bitches, Bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

We hit the B-town like Oakland players
I knew it bitches was everywere
The first one had tities so fat
But that don't work her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
Talked about the bitch like a muthafuckin' fool
I said ""Beyotch
I know I'm capin'
Where's your ass baby, what happened?""
She turned around caped back on me
Said ""Fuck you nigga, where's your teeth?""
I damn near fell jumping out the car
But I slapped that bitch and slapped her hard
My homie said ""$hort, we gots to cut""
But I was spankin' that bitch on her big flat butt
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said ""Baby, baby, baby come here
Yeah you baby with the long long hair""
Baby came over from across the street
Standing on the corner talking to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked too fast
Cause I didn't even notice that she had a flat ass
Sheit!
And I was ready to go
We was rollin' back to the O'
I told that bitch ""I changed my mind""
She looked at me and she said ""Why""
I said ""I'm Sir Too $hort the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and your flat booty""

It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got

Comin' through, like I do, you know, gettin' my bark on
Knew she was a thug 'cause when I met her she had a scarf on
5411, size 7 in girls
Babyface, would look like she was 11 with curls
Girlfriend, remember me (what?) from way back?
I'm the same cat with the wave cap
That motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here, so it's all good
Oh, you know my niggas Rich and them
Doin' they thing on 35th? Damn, it's a small hood
And it's all wood, so let me get that number, I get up
Aight? Hit you on the jack later on, see whassup
Talkin' to shorty made me wanna do somethin' nice
Lookin' at that ass made me wanna do somethin' tonight
And I know right when I see right, shorty lookin' like she tight

Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is gettin' fatter
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I'da kept it more than real boo, can't lose with me (true)
Heard he smacked you
'Cause you said my name while y'all was sexin'
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin'
You know I ain't even with that
So he gon' have to get that just on GP
Try to creep me (what?), leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, that's your kids daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big Caddy

Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Puttin' somethin' in a nigga's wig if you squeal for me
Kill for me, you're still with me?
'Cause we get down like what
Told you's from the door, it ain't all about a nut
I'm gon' be fair, tryin' to be there, we gon' see then
Hit me with the question, boo, that answer gon' be ""yeah""
See there, somethin' can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go, and it came back, that's how strong it was
But she belonged to cuz, couldn't belong to me
She had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me
But we gon' always be best of friends, haha

149,Better Days,"[Verse 1]
I just want you to know that I'm stuck in your soul
Funny how last week I thought it couldn't be so
What I see in your eyes words can't come close
No matter what your father says I just want you to know
That you're a beautiful person, and I want you to grow
The way he talks to you's just so inappro
I hope that you're strong, when he's doing you wrong
And I hope you find comfort in the words of these songs
Now sing along and while I tell you this story just listen closely
I know you like my music but look, you don't really know me
See I live outside the city where there's nothing going on
I just look around for meaning while I'm sitting on my lawn
One day I met this girl and she was beautiful too
I look closely at her eyes, a nice light shade of blue
She was still in high school, I was one year removed
We're both a little older from the things we've been through
Pretty soon I started seeing all the things he would do
She wasn't black and blue but emotionally bruised
It made me so mad I didn't know what to do
Told her no matter what, I'mma be there for you
But as things became more hectic in my life I started fadin' out
Began to lie to her, I wasn't fair to her, I hate it now
I hope that you can understand my honesty
I really fuckin' wanna knock that dude out honestly
You don't have to believe it but I think about you every day
I sing about you every way cause you're the perfect melody
I know the world ain't perfect but to me you were my everything
My little light of sunshine I'm holdin' on for better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

[Verse 2]
I wanna go back where we were sittin' at that ice cream shop
I'm lookin' at you in your eyes I'm feelin' like my heart has stopped
You laugh at me for gettin' soy peanut butter
Back then I thought (shit, nah)
I don't need no other person in my life and nothing else don't even matter to me
Maybe I'm so numb that nothin' bad can ever happen to me
Maybe I'm so evil I attract all of these tragedies
Maybe we're so graceful we create all of these masterpieces
So facetious we would laugh about it
Nobody can reach us for a half an hour sleepin' in my half-apartment we don't have to watch the news
I never felt more comfortable my face so close to you
And I'mma break it down for you
I think about you every day I sing about you every way cause you're the perfect melody
I know the world ain't perfect but to me you were my everything
My little light of sunshine I'm holdin' on for better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

[Verse 3]
What does it mean if I don't know what love feels like
My parents got divorced when I was young so I just feel like
Examples that I have to look upon are probably not great
Knowing you're in a similar position doesn't make it O.K
I'm feeling like my goal is to make these blue skies turn grey
But in the blink of an eye it could go away
So even if it's just for ten minutes I wanna drive around with you
And think about our life in the present these are our better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

150,26 Cents,"[Verse 1]
She sat all alone on a bus out of Beaumont
The courage of just eighteen years
A penny and quarter were taped to a letter
And Momma's goodbye in her ears

[Verse 2]
She watched as her high school faded behind her
And the house with the white picket fence
Then she read the note that her momma had wrote
Wrapped up with 26 cents

[Chorus]
When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love

[Verse 3]
A penny and quarter buys a whole lot of nothing
Taped to an old wrinkled note
And when she didn't have much she had all Momma's love
Inside that old envelope

[Chorus]
When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love

[Bridge]
Oh it's been years since Momma's been gone
But when she holds the coins
She feels her love just as strong

[Chorus]
When you get lonely, call me
Anything at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give

HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention

People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the kush plant brush in a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut clones
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
DEA, never wanna leave me alone
But never ever ever gotta warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)

Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

You all about the beef but me, I’m 'bout the bun, the bread

Now I got my shit together spittin' what they fuckin' with
If they ain’t it’s great no intention to the hate
Nothing changed still cutting up, Henny’s still my drink

Then you came and love moved back in
Now it's my turn to give back again
I want you to know that

I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Cause you were always there for me
So let me return the favor, please

So many people wasted my time
Too bad I couldn't
See behind their smiles
Are you an angel in disguise
Cause you made me realize

You will always be my best friend
Cause you gave me the
Strength to go on again
I want you to know that

I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Cause you were always there for me
You were always there, baby
So let me return the favor, please
Let me, let me, baby

I owe it all (I owe it all)
To you (to you)
Baby love, what can I do
(What can I do)

I owe it all (I owe it all)
To you (to you)
And I'll do anything for you

I said if loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
No, not tonight
Never wanna fight
Baby, only you can make it right

Me say, fans them follow me
Boys them bother me
Girls them watch me
Kids adore me
Still I put God before me

Me say, Arista love me
Number one company
Big up to me family
Cause only you have spoiled me

I'm here for you
(Whenever you need someone)
When you need someone too
(When you need)

Always there for me (always)
So let me return the favor, please
(Let me, let me)

I'm here for you
(Well, you know you can find me)
Need someone too
(I'll fill your every need)

Always there for me
(I will be your everything)
So let me return the favor, please

(I want you to know that)
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
(When you need)
Always there for me
(Yeah, oh, yeah)
So let me return the favor, please

I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Cause you were always there for me
So let me return the favor, please",Andrea Martin,1998,"[82, 84, 84, 85, 92]",5
157,Strawberry,"[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear, I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, ohh, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times here

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye

[Outro: Coldplay]
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be gray
Without you I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time

159,Only When I Lose Myself,"[Chorus]
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

[Verse 1]
Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotised, I feel paralysed
I have found heaven

[Verse 2]
There's a thousand reasons why I shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here I can think of two
To keep me hanging on feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven

[Chorus]
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

[Verse 3]
I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here
I feel satisfied, I belong inside
Your velvet heaven

[Bridge]
Did I need to sell my soul for pleasure like this?
Did I have to lose control to treasure your kiss?
Did I need to place my heart in the palm of your hand
Before I could even start to understand?

[Chorus]
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else

160,If I Had The Chance,"Verse 1:
If I had the mind I have, back then
If I had the chance to go live that part again
Know just for a fact, that we wouldn’t be friends
Cause how you got the best of me, wasn’t a good end
When the walls closed in, the only problem was you
Tried to blame on somebody, but the problem was you
Its always hard think about the bad and know that its true
And how you tripping off on red, changing colours to blue (yeah)
I hear you living better, proper, after we had scandaled
I’m now a husband, got a wifey, wit a kid to handle
Time goes on and rapping this, is all I can do
As days go on, don’t think I’d ever understand you
With our situations… when it was complicated
Or how I’d hate it, when you angry, you have conversations
With other muthaphukkers, making me, just wanna break shit
Man its fuxked up, how in love, when it makes you anxious

Chorus: X2
If I had the mind I have, back then
If I had the chance to go live that part again
Know just for a fact, that I wouldn’t hold back
To put a patch where the holes be in

*Instrumental Break

Verse 2:
How to remember all the words, you last said to to me
You called me perfect, now its worsen, I’m your enemy
I can’t remember anything that you had said to me
Probably “love you"", that you’re loyal, while in bed wit me
You know them moments, where I told you that you’d be alright
That I won’t hurt you, I’ll protect you, for our future life
But shit got twisted, its inflicted, though I did you right
And backed you up against opponents, who you didn't like
And how i didn't fight... you know that gets to me
Bigger muthaphukkers, be tougher and they all step to me
But like her dad said , ""nothing ever last""
Had her falling off the edges, like a falling glass
While our time lasted, moments so magic
If things were to be different, who knows what would happen
Like I said wit a mind like mine...
Hit rewind, all these thing you'll find (for real)

Chorus: X2
If I had the mind I have, back then
If I had the chance to go live that part again
Know just for a fact, that I wouldn’t hold back
To put a patch where the holes be in",Dartanion Crayzee,1998,"[86, 87, 89, 98, 83, 95, 95]",7

Left the tears outside my door
And I'm not gonna be the one
Who's left out in the rain no more

Telling me I'm gonna be alright after all
Now I've opened my eyes

No room for sad regrets
'Cause the past is done and gone
And I learned that it's time that makes you wise
And truth that makes you strong
You thought you were so cool
Pulled the wool right over my heart
Now you see that you can't keep this heart in the dark
'Cause I see through your lies
Won't be blind one more time
No, no, no fool no more

No fool no more
Not like before
Not the way it used to be
No fool no more
No tears this time
'Cause this time, I'm wise
To the game that's been going on
And I'm not gonna be no fool no more

Gonna pull my heart together
Gonna leave the past behind
Gonna get to something better
Put you out of my mind
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna be fine
I just want you to know

If I was cheating
I would have erased it

Must everywhere you go be on the down low?
If you wasn't creeping
Tell me why

If I told you
You’d say it was untrue
I keep denying
Sick of trying
Maybe I should lie to you

Gotta take Jo Whiley's microphone back to her today, and, um
Yeah, I'm, um, bit nervous, really

[Intro]
This is a message to Jo Whiley:
Jo, seriously, the year I've had has been crazy
I've had a stomach ulcer and a broken heart
I've been out with a celebrity
But, thankfully, no one found out about that

[Verse 1]
I was just going to post it back anonymously
But, Jo, that's not what my mum and dad raised me up to be
I made a deal with superstition and I make deals to keep
September 2003, Friday the 13th
I was on your show, you supported me, I thank you eternally
Things were different back then, before the gambling learned me
The days of free beer, before that said celebrity fling
Back then, I was desperate to make an excellent second disc
I did something bad but always vowed to my soul
That if my next work increased my amount of albums that sold
Enough for Mike to not end up back out on the dole
I promised I'd promptly send you back what I stole

[Chorus]
I don't know how to say this one but I stole your microphone
While I was on your live radio show, Jo
(Friday the 13th is unlucky for some, I tell you)
The thirteenth is unlucky for some (But not for my mum)
But that Friday was lucky for Mum
'Cause that mic you loaned me made for a number one
(Number one, so thank you)

[Verse 2]
I slid a Neumann microphone into my pocket
Bowled out the studio just as Avril Lavigne got in, oi
I was nervous like, even though that type of swipe's quite easy
And not 'cause of how many millions had tuned in to me speak
I don't feel good about it and I don't want to repeat it
But the mic went pride of place on Grand Don't Come For Free
Three years on, now I'm all in, now I've won what I've needed
So I want to be straight up, and own up for the deed
I wasn't going to tell you, but I started feeling bad
'Cause you were so safe when I went in
Around the release of my last
It's a joke, anyway, what I wanted to say is just, ""Sorry""
I took your mic, but I'm sending it back to you, promptly
(You can have it back, seriously)

[Chorus]
I don't know how to say this one (I really am sorry)
But I stole your microphone
While I was on your live radio show, Jo
The thirteenth is unlucky for some (But not for my mum)
The thirteenth is unlucky for some
But that Friday was lucky for mum
'Cause that mic you loaned me made for a number one

[Bridge]
I keep gettin' these letters about not paying my license fee
They're all red, it's a warning to pay
(You know, to say you gotta pay)
Then after a while they go back to blue for a change
Then I'll pay that as well as my water rates
(My heating doesn't actually work at the moment)

[Chorus]
I don't know how to say this one but I stole your microphone
While I was on your live radio show, Jo
The thirteenth's unlucky for some
But that Friday was lucky for mum
'Cause that mic you loaned me made for a number one

[Outro]
There it is, seriously, I am really hon–I am really sorry, honest
Er, yeah, I'm not gonna use the fact that I was drunk
To, you know, excuse mysel–I was drunk though
It even broke at one point, I had it repaired, serious
It costs quite a lot to have those microphones repaired
But yeah, I've grown quite attached to it
So, um, we named him ""Silver"", er, I recorded, er, nearly two albums
So, yeah, please give him a good home
'Cause he's become, you know, really quite a good friend",Bloc Party,1998,"[100, 100, 100, 93, 93]",5

Yo, dunn, they tried to knock me down, bury me under
Big pipes soundin' like thunder
Skated by the skin of my teeth
I had to put a man in his place last week
Now, why you wanna come at me?
I'm the wrong nigga to approach like that, homes
Wrong nigga for threats, lone nigga wit long chrome
And we can dance till one of us drop
You score points fallin' wit good formation
I'm the wrong nigga for patience, wrong one at dunn
The very last nigga you should ever blast your gun
To the floor, actin like you goin' to war
Now, you fucked up, here come a real rocket launcher
Flame thrower, rule wit a iron rod
That be the Ruger, y'all niggas keep tryin' hard
But who the loser when you can't walk your hood at night
And you can't come outside without fear?
Am I in your thoughts often? While you be walkin?

The last man standin', pack shit longer than bare wake
Neither the jake nor the snakes gon' stop it

Yo, hear my gat blow, make you spit out crack the actual
That brand new six that you couldn't seem to whip
Empty the clip, make sure no friendly get hit
While you layin' bloodied up in the six
Flee the front-line, dismantle gat and bounce
Then watch the twelve o'clock news and hear 'em shout you out
Plug leak, slip rug right from under your feet
You runnin the streets, you don't want no problems wit us

Interfere wit the plan and you will get touched
Let the liquor talk for you and you will get touched

We got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me? I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'mma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on

Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war

I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Tryna find what's really going on in the streets

Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree

Get applause like a matador, cry yelling, ""Ole!""

Makes you wonder where you are

179,Money Ain't A Thang,"[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Uh uh
So So Def
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z]
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R, flashing the rings
With the window cracked, holla back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang
Come on,  y'all wanna floss with us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya' slacking on your pimping, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' ho
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Trying to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun, son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z]
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R, flashing the rings

'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya' slacking on your pimping, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
My cake thick, I live the life
Eating crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why? Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all, but every night I swing

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z]
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Jermaine Dupri]
Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxing
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction!
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice
Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Rollie with the ice bezel?
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame, screamin' 'It's not a game!'
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z]
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes

Soon it'll be apart, stay here to the touch of morning
I'm glad we're leaving as friends
Baby, by the way, I forgot to say

Can't we try, love was never born to say goodbye
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am
But I don't give a damn, sorry, I forgot myself
I guess that I'm just not myself

And I know that we're not supposed to cry
Love was supposed to die when people get to know each other
In case I don't see you again
Really wish you well, baby, this is hell

Can't we try, love was never born to say goodbye
Touch me one more time and make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
At least we'll have a moment here with honest pain and tears

Then say goodbye, come lay your head down on my heart
The morning suddenly leads you, you know, yet I don't need you
We can't go back to yesterday, go away
Girl, I wished you'd stay

Can't we try, love was never born to say goodbye
Touch me one more time and make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
Then we will end like we began and even though it's over

Can't we try, let's go back to yesterday, and I
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am
But I don't give a damn
See, once before I set you free, I just got to hold you close to me

Can't we try, love was never born to say goodbye
I want you to touch me, touch me one more time
And make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
Then we can end like we began and even though it's over

Can't we try, let's go back to yesterday, and I

I know we'll be together again, 'cause

Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me

Good times we'll share again

Makes me wanna dance

All my love's for you

[Bridge]
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel you smile upon me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
What I'd give just to hold you close as on earth
In heaven, we will be together, baby

Together again, my baby
(Together again, my baby)

Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me

188,Woof Woof,"[Intro]
The initial path of the crew cabin from the vapor cloud carried it across the path of an adjacent contrail, clearly revealing its truncated form and attitude

Am I pretty?
Do I deserve to be?
Would you tell me if I was worthy?

Now that you're home, I don’t have to be alone
I know it’s selfish but I already know
So self-aware, I intend to die this way
There is nothing that anyone can change

Someone tell me
Who am I supposed to be?
Give me direction
I need affection

Late at night, I don’t have to be myself
Pretend to read all of the books placed on my shelf
I called the cops on someone that I don’t know
I told my friends I got somewhere better to go",ARTHUR,1998,"[94, 94, 81, 80, 73, 56, 56, 45, 50, 46, 35, 35, 31, 31, 44, 61]",16

And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, ha-hmm
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, hey

[Verse 1]
A Bouvier 'til her wedding day
Shots rang out, the police came
Mama laid me on the front lawn
And prayed for Jackie’s strength
Feeling old by 21
Never thought my day would come
My bridesmaids getting laid
I pray for Jackie’s strength

[Chorus]
Make me laugh
Say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
What black magic can do
Make me laugh
Say you know you can turn
Me into the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn

[Verse 2]
Stickers licked on lunch boxes
Worshipping David Cassidy
Yeah, I mooned him once on Donna’s box
She’s still in recovery
Sleepovers Beene’s got some pot
You’re only popular with anorexia
So I turn myself inside out
In hope someone will see, will see

[Chorus]
Make me laugh
Say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
What black magic can do
Make me laugh
Say you know you can turn
Me into the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn

And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie's strength
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, hey

[Verse 3]
I got lost on my wedding day
Typical, the police came out
But virgins always get backstage
No matter what they’ve got to say
If you love enough you’ll lie a lot
Guess they did in Camelot
Mama’s waiting on my front lawn
I pray, I pray, I said I pray for Jackie’s strength, strength

[Chorus]
Make me laugh
Say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn

190,What I Didn't Know,"And right, right from the start
You stole my heart
I was in love, I was in love
And we, we sat side by side on those moonlight drives
And swore we’d be true, swore we’d be true

Life is long, it’s rights and wrongs
Sometimes you lose and sometimes you win
But if time could change your heart again
I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then

And you, became my life
So much beauty hides
And I thought I knew, if I only knew
And I, I missed all the signs time after time
It was all a lie, your love was a lie

Life is long, it’s rights and wrongs
Sometimes you lose and sometimes you win
But if time could change your heart again
I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then
I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then
I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then

191,What U See Is What U Get,"[Intro]
And so it was written, and after all these things
I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory
And he cried mightily with a strong voice saying
""Babylon the great has fallen
Has fallen and has become the habitation of devils
And the home to every foul spirit
And a cage of very unclean, and hateful men""

[Verse 1]
Yeah, what you see is what you get now
Xzibit never wait around for no kickdown, got my own shit loud
Shot heard around the world
Uplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple
To make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time
Only concerned with what is mine, divine
Never monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line
Holdin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)
Plus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep
Don't wanna see none of this evil I speak
Around the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress
You all get close-lined and pinned to the mattress
All day, every day, every which way
Who said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)
This is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth
Xzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this

[Bridge]
Players, pimps, hoes, hustlers
Willies, thugs, ballers, busters
Gangstas, macks, everyday, all day
Shot callers, even high rollers keep it moving

[Chorus]
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit

[Verse 2]
You got more than you bargained for; hit the floor
I pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black
Take your breath like an asthma attack
Just a slave like Flavor Flav, ""You're blind to the facts""
Mr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee
Guaranteed to bring the house down naturally
Niggas knowin No Limits like Master P
Makin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)
A whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me
Catch a three-hundred and sixty degree
Roundhouse to the mouth right
And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright
I feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red
Cause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread
Niggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead
Came crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it

[Chorus]
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit

[Verse 3]
The year everybody start to rush
Swingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush
I crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust
I regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight
Start to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work
Heavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt
Stay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt
Slug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt
Get cut from the belly up (What?)
I break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane
I'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things
Material things, protected by the underground kings
Who rule the land with an iron fist
The Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)
You cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam
Cause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?

You only have to say you love me
To make it worth it
You only have to say you love me
And I'm flying flying
So many times I try
To find a way that I
Will never be denied
To your world
I put aside my pride
Cross the great divide
I wanna stay inside

Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Yeah it's the way we are
We were smoking by 11 and knocking 'round town
Beat 'em ups on my arm
We were never good at selling, couldn't cut down
And I stay with my father while his friends die of heart attacks
He's got a heart made of stone but he never gets cold because the sun's always on his back
""I used to think you were cool and I believed you had a wonderful vision
But I soon found out you're a terrible friend and your mother's on the television""
Give's a go on your bike, how you getting along with your life?
It's alright
Yeah it's alright

Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby

""Well, it's coming to the end of you and me,"" she said, ""is that alright?""
And how can you complain about life and talk about being bored?
If you just sit at Pete's house playing video games, doing sniff that you can't afford
I can't be picking up in the town
So get me one off Adam if he's sorting you out
I don't really care what all your friends were about
I was always looking for a way to get out
It's just a reflection on the size of your house
A silver spoon and a zoot in your mouth
But you're alright
Yeah it's alright

Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright

[Verse 3]
So here we are, it's quarter to 11, we're knocking 'round town
Pushing in, in the bar, you can cry until 11, it's a quarter of an hour
And why stay if you hate it so much?
You think you're well cool
You just write about sex and killing yourself and how you hardly ever went to school
Don't you want to take me up in the clouds?
Pretend that I'm the one and you can show me about
She was talking marriage so we had to get out
Now he's making up for it by sleeping about
Your ultimatum's a ridiculous joke
I'm gonna pick that option that allows me to smoke
But I'm alright
Yeah it's alright

194,Definition,"[Intro: Talib Kweli, Mos Def, & Sample]
Hello, everybody. Recording live from somewhere
Looooord... Lord have mercy
Black Star
All nice and decent crew
This is timeless! C'mon!
Follow me now, we say
Say, Hi-Tek, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up! C'mon, c'mon!
Say, J. Rawls, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up, everybody
Redefinition, say, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up, c'mon
Say, Black Star, come to rock it non—

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, forecast and aftermath of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this, you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gathering
Connecting like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenements
'Cause all my Brooklyn residents, known as heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence—where Brooklyn? (WHOA!)
See that? Bound to take it all, kid, believe that
From where they sell they tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli, e-Kweli-ty, yo, tell 'em where we be at;

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Brooklyn, New York City, where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust, 'cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
What a pity—blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant, can't be covered with incense
My presence felt; my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinking MC is shorthand for misconception
Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate
Walking the streets is like battling; be careful with your body
You must know karate and think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituaries
Third grade teacher reading and talking about, ""I knew he'd amount to nothing.""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type, who'd have thought they was fronting?""
Talking loud like you on RCA, get carted away with
Body parts and trays, what a way to start your day, yo, it's like—

[Hook: Mos Def]
One, two, three (C'mon!)
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top (C'mon!)
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said, one, two, three
It's kind of dangerous to be a MC (C'mon!)
They shot 2Pac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
I said Manhattan keep on making it, Brooklyn keep on taking it
So, relax, we're taking it back, Red Hook where we're living at
Plenty cats be struggling not hustling and bubbling
It ain't about production, then —what is we discussing?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Striving for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose
Colossal! True, original b-boy apostle
Standing on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo

[Verse 4: Talib Kweli]
You think you the shit? Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or clique or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spitting the epitome of stupidity
Living my life, expressing my liberty, it gotta be
Done properly, my name is in the middle of equality
People follow me, and other cats they hear 'em flow
And assume I'm the real one with the lyrics like I'm Cyrano

[Verse 5: Mos Def]
Still sipping wishing well water imported from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all the believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot precede us
In the jungle with the leaders, we them lions, you the cheetahs
Our cypher will complete us as we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus! Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up; think it over, ease up

One, two, three

Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time
Some will win, some will lose

You never understand until it slips away
And looking back I think you knew

Brother to brother

Everybody's hangin' on the healer
Everybody's pullin' at the preacher man
Everybody's lookin' for a leader
To save the world, they think it's only he who can

Why don't they know?
Why don't they see?
God gave His power
To you and me

One heart at a time
One light to another
One heart at a time
Brother to brother

To fields are right to harvest
They're ready don't ya know
But if everybody's just sittin' 'round waitin'
Tell me, who is gonna go?

The other man of God you've ever heard
Everyone began
Just holdin' on to Jesus
Reachin' out to just one Man

One light to another
Just one heart at a time

One heart at a time
One light to another
One heart at a time

Our friend's fixed for us to bump in
Oh, I'm done looking
Now things can start happening

Hey, remember me?
I've got so much, just come and get me
I played something catchy
You leaned forward and kissed me

All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it

What?
You want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?

Love sometimes
Can be like destiny....
There's no way to say forever
May not realize your dreams
And love sometimes
Is like the blowin' wind
It can take us to wherever
Sending us on silent wings
But I have broken
All the rules of love...
I never dreamed that
I could come this far....
And now I'm lost in my emotions
You're becoming my devotion
There's nothing I can do
To stop this love for you...

I was not supposed to fall in love with you
I have someone else....
Someone else is loving you
And I was not supposed to
Let this love get through

(my love is true when I'm with you... ooh...oooh...you...ooo)

How could I have known that in your eyes
(in your eyes) I would find the deepest answer
To the questions of my heart
And how could I have known
That by your side
(by your side)
Was the light to fill the darkness
And the shadows of my life
But I have broken all the rules of love
I never dreamed that I could come this far
And now I'm lost in my emotion

Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We should've did this already
Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be

Just like you, I get lonely too

Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do

Be who you are nothing more nothing less
And let the beauty that you love be the very best
Sing praises to the highest with your feet on the ground
And reach for your brother with the words that you sound and
Don't let mistakes be so monumental, and
Don't let your love be so confidential, and
Don't let your mind be so darn judgmental
And please let your heart be more influential

Be thankful for all the Spirit provides
And be thankful for all that you can see without eyes
Give thanks to music that keeps us alive
And give thanks to all the DJs worldwide

The music and the harmony, the family and friends
It seems like when your dancin' man, the feelin' never ends
The base of the base, the voice of the drum
The fumble of the keys, my weapon is my tounge
If there's love in the rhythm then the soul is gonna follow
We turnin' up the system, it'll go until tomorrow
If you need some money, I got some that you can borrow
We dance until the sun come up and cast shadows
Right now… the tune reflects, lights out… we soon connect
We ride (ride) on lows and high
So hot that we sweat, so happy we cry
Wish bygones goodbye, thank god we's alive
Wit' time on our side and this rhyme I provide
We smile while we slide, do I say goodbye (nah)
We keep it rockin' like the sound of lion

It's hot…. and the police man come
And try to break up the party tonight…… uh ha (I say hey now now)

And would brace ourselves for the fight

I know this shawty right
She got a shorty right
She be workin' hard so she can keep her shorty right
She be on the job, 40 days and 40 nights
12 months a year, see she want a career
Her parents in her ear, they swear just to mold her right
Try to be aware of the peer pressures on your life
To be your wife
You gotta have the qualities of honesty
Dedication, insight
Preparation in tight times gotta grind
To the whistles pay no mind when they starin' from behind
Yellin', ""Yo shawty, hey momma, let me holla.""
Say ""No po' no dollar, no way don't follow.""

Act proper for the possibilities and dreams

Sessions in the AM

And when we do everything on me
Brand new crib, red bows on the V
Never have a want, get you everything you need

When I fucked shit up and I hurt your plans
But now I'm gettin' up

Look at the sky
Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me
The heavens are sparkling
With starlight tonight
That's what I see through your eyes
I see the heavens
Each time that you smile
I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see through your eyes

Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark

It's out of our hands
We can't stop

And instead I see us
Whoever I am now

And I see a girl
Who is learning to trust

219,Stepping Stone,"[Intro]
Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot!

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 2]
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me, Biz, ""Rockstar"" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

To all the friends I may have hurt

End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

[Verse 3]
Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

[Chorus]
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

I’m invincible, how could this go wrong?
No, here, here’s where we belong
I see a road ahead
I never thought I would dare to tread

My love, my life
But I know I don’t possess you
With all my heart, God bless you
You will be my love and my life
You’re my one and only

Felt your heart beat

Oh yes, and as one are we
In the now and beyond
Nothing and no one can break this bond

221,Cover You In Kisses,"You say it's cold back there in Denver
A foot of new snow on the ground
You're all bundled up in blankets
I'd give anything to be there with you now

I'd cover you in kisses
Hold you in my arms
That's all that I can think of
Every minute we're apart
Darlin' I've been livin'
For the moment that we touch
So I can cover you in kisses
And wrap you in my love

Baby keep that fire burnin'
Pour a glass of that sweet wine
Let your hair down on your shoulders
And I'll be there just in time

To cover you in kisses
Hold you in my arms
That's all that I can think of
Every minute we're apart
Darlin' I've been livin'
For the moment that we touch
So I can cover you in kisses

222,Cheated (To All The Girls),"Wyclef:
Chickenheads, gobble, gobble
Thugs in the dance, no shootin', shootin', shootin'

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the girls I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(to all the girls I cheated on before)

Wyclef:
Hey yo, dear queen, by the the time you get this letter
It's 4 pages but my name ain't Aaliyah, what?
I don't know much about biology or chemistry
Failed the SAT's, study Brooklyn Zoo-ology
Remember me, Wyclef, the memory
Ectasy with no theory of manoghany
""To be or not to be"", last words from Shakespeare
But a package says I wanna get rich with no fear
A few good men in the new millineam
Women got a new law, if you cheat you're a dead man
So I been dead like 100 times
Ask Cyndi Lauper, she'll tell you time after time
Like a virgin when I hit it for the very first time
She became a nymphomaniac and wanted it all the time
A thin line between love and lust
She mistake me for the rapper when I said ""Can-I-Bus?""

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me

I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(to all the guys I cheated on before)

Queen Pen:
Yo, I checked for you since I was straight up strugglin'
Before your cousin Jerry put you on, when you was nothin'
So why you play me like I don't know jack ish
('Cause like K-Solo, your mom's in my business)
Now who you wanna play loco to mine
Feelin' kinda twisted, heard through the grapevine
That I'm doin' my thing, more more waiting
(I swear) Many a years and many a tears
I use chose remix to make it quite clear
That he came in when you didn't want to be there
And I fell victim to this one night affair
By the time weeks came you was already there
And still I come home just looking at you
See I'm feeling kinda guilty but revengeful too
All the dirt you done done, you don't know a clue
Why I don't sex you no more, and that's not coo'

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the guys I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(let me sum this all up)

Wyclef:
Yo, yo, yo, and yo from the college dorm and til the dusk is dawn
I never felt cold until I lost one
Don't let go like EnVogue chocked on
Clash of the titans, now I'm on my unicorn
I left New Jerus, I'm on my way to Brook-lawn
Someone hit my bumper, I turned around and saw Sharon
Got surprised because I saw little Shawn
In the passenger seat with a bottle of Dom
Remain calm, called Cocren on the horn
Salaam, call up the chief 'cause a murder 'bout to go on
What the bomb, bomb, but this ain't a reggea song
It's like a old flick ""Godzilla Versus King Kong""
If you saw the movie than you know what's gonna happen
West coat, down south, back to Manhattan
Like Vanessa from ""Soul Food"" when she came at night, B
Thank God it was a dream 'cause I woke up with my wifey

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me

223,If You Ever Have Forever In Mind,"[Verse 1:]
You're climbing mountains, I'm on a hill
You're always running I'm standing still
You live for the moment, no future no past
I may be a fool to love by the rules and want it to last

If you ever have forever in mind
I'll be here and easy to find
If your heart isn't ready to lay down with mine
If you ever have forever in mind

224,Spark,"[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Bridge]
Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?

I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will

225,2 Way Street,"[Verse 1]
Well, I shot some deer, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to rap's wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly drawers flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately, wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin'
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scopin' Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie, I was extremely tempted
(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sister
Next thing, in the dressin' room, ""Pardon me, mister""
Yes, I said cautiously, ""Crazy, but possibly you could sign
Your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me""
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, ""You can press down hard on it""
Now, my hand browsin' her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
(Rring!) Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talkin' so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no tellin' what it might do to her
""I love you"", forced to say, ""I love you back, too"" to her
Any thought of gettin' pussy was doomed too
""You got a wife?"", anniversary comin' up soon, too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
""Don't get me wrong, it's not like you're not cute"" (Uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreatin' her, the wantin' to skeetin' her
""I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya""
What an angel overcomin' his wrongness
The moral I am tryin' to get across in this song is

[Hook]
If goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realize early, it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
If goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realize early, it's a 2 way street, kid

[Verse 2]
Casually seatin' with some thick chords eatin'
With my album playin' at a big board meetin'
""I love this!""
Being the coolest and the ruffest
A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment
Poundin' was inevitable
She said to me, ""Rick, I think your album is incredible""
The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
""You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye""
""Well, I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, comin' from a woman of your stature""
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressin' Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats to set the emperor
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my weddin' band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, ""I can't do this as much as I'd like to, miss""
An angel overcomin' his wrong, kids
The point that I am tryin' to get across in this song is

I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on

Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far, like a distant star

I'd give my all to have

Produce more flavor than Very Fine juice

Recline my seat rock to the beat
Leaning so hard, it's like my whole squad up in the Jeep
Blowing up the spot or we hit them know what I mean

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy

Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

[Verse 1]
I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
Or nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but never
Will I kill, I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin' on 'til what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' motherfuckas, stay on the floor
4-4, that's what I get sick with (Grrrrrrr)
Four more, now all this is liquid (Grrrrrr)

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin'
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money, just give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin' me to stop, but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack

When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin' me for their help
Hopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside
When the sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, then another and another
Gun pops, goin' through you and your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?

231,The Arms Of The One Who Loves You,"[Verse 1: LaTocha]
I know you're going
I can't make you stay
I can only let you know I love you any way
And if the road you take leads to heartbreak
Somewhere down the line
If someone ever hurts you
Or treats your heart unkind

[Chorus]
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you
You just run to these arms
And these two arms will keep you warm
When rain has found your heart
Never fear, I'm never far
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you

[Verse 2: LaTocha]
I want you happy
I want the best for you
And if you have to leave to find your dream
I hope that dream comes true
But if the world you find brings you hard times
If someone makes you cry
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be standing by

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Tamika (LaTocha)]
My love is strong enough, you know
Strong enough to let you go
But I'll always hold you
Inside my heart
(And if you should ever change your mind
You can come back any time)
And when you do (and when you do)

[John Forté - Verse 1]
Yo...yo...
Hustle big, hustle small
All y'all relate to it
I'm a a culture power, baby, when I run right through it
What the biz, money? You know John and what it is
But then again too many yes-men...
(Wyclef: ""Yo John, they missed it."")
Hustle big, hustle small
All y'all relate to it
I'm a a culture power, baby, when I slide right through it
What the biz, money? You know John and what it is
Then again too many yes-men inside the business
We stay grungy
Risk take on streets like a bungee
Hoes get nothing from me
I'm-a die feeling hungry
Rappers too complacent
I make hits in the basement
Got all the men on top wondering where they placement
If it's real, then it's real
And it ain't no replacement
Them jealous cats who talk need to all walk adjacent
I trifold y'all all into a image my mold
So I can teach you how to walk, eat, drink, and buy gold
My shit is iz-ill
Wear three condoms out in Brazil
Brothers from the 'ville no fault at the iz-ill
Wanna have a duke? Get real! How you fiz-eel?
You couldn't stick me if you brought the chisel
What the diz-eal?
Eat four stars at every miz-eal
You kiz-ill the vibe
You just high from the twiz-ill
And sti-zill I flow riz-ill, leave you fiz-ill
And leave y'all all stuck like Jack from without the Jiz-ill
What?

[John Forté - Verse Two]
I shoot the gift cop
Find John at the strip spot
Juggling three who all know to keep their lips locked
I don't get got
I told y'all before: it's hot
Fuck the floss
I'm the boss when I rock flip-flops
Culture hip-hop
Before I take your head you should skip bop
Or find us in your homes with the chrome and the shits cocked
What?
Hey y'all pose hard, but they rip up
I leave them enemies with their lips shut
Did what?
Yo money ease up how you cease us
You better off reefin' lighting trees up
Smoking with your mens fantasizing something swiftly
But little did you know I had the whole country with me

Little do you know (3x)

Now the mufucka got a brand new Glock
They don't know about the brand new choppa for the same old hater
Niggas mad that a nigga can't stop
They don't know about the old school whip that I keep pulled up
When I pull it out they be like ""Who that?""
They don't know about the old school days when a nigga had waves
I swear every night I wore a du-rag
They don't know about the old school days
Magic city, it was jumping, niggas want to see some booty
Got a old school ho trynna screw me
So I'mma hit that pussy from the back, made her scream like (scream)
And it's still money
Over bitches

Cuz I done ran my sack up crazy
I might buy my dad a mercedes
And I just found out I got a baby
On the way
I know the situation sound a little crazy
And they ain't know I was worth that much 'till I dropped that mixtape and showed they ass
And they ain't know I was on them Percocet but they know I be on them Xan
And they know I ain't with that groupie shit but got mad love for my fans

They don't know about the pain, pain, pain
That a nigga been goin' through lately baby
Shit done got a little crazy lately
Shoot a nigga, make his ass a grady baby
And that pussy so wet, I might recruit myself in the Navy baby
Used to be George Washington, now it's Ben Franklin
I had a change of face
They don't know about the new spot that I just got
With the cameras everywhere so they see your ass
I'm in New York spending Nino cash
A broke nigga, I can never be your ass
And I'm the future nigga
I see your past
Who the fuck told you I want to be your ass?
With these diamonds lookin' like water
Boy, I've got Nemo mad
And they don't know that my mama still working
They don't know I'm unsigned, they don't know I'm still hustlin'
They knew about the spot on Gresham that my uncle meat had
Two times got busted

You have a world but it stopped turning
You lose the day and gain the dark

Find your feet and your fortune can be told

Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

248,I Honestly Love You (David Foster Vers.),"The Reason of Church Government Urg'd Against Prelaty

THE PREFACE.

In the publishing of humane lawes, which for the most part aime not beyond the good of civill society, to set them barely forth to the people without reason or Preface, like a physicall prescript, or only with threatnings, as it were a lordly command, in the judgement of Plato was thought to be done neither generously nor wisely. His advice was, seeing that persuasion certainly is a more winning, and more manlike way to keepe men in obedience then feare, that to such lawes as were of principall moment, there should be us'd as an induction, some well temper'd discourse, shewing how good, how gainfull, how happy it must needs be to live according to honesty and justice, which being utter'd with those native colours and graces of speech, as true eloquence the daughter of vertue can best bestow upon her mothers praises, would so incite, and in a manner, charme the multitude into the love of that which is really good, as to imbrace it ever after, not of custome and awe, which most men do, but of choice and purpose, with true and constant delight. But this practice we may learn, from a better & more ancient authority, then any heathen writer hath to give us, and indeed being a point of so high wisdome & worth, how could it be but we should find it in that book, within whose sacred context all wisdome is infolded? Moses therefore the only Lawgiver that we can believe to have beene visibly taught of God, knowing how vaine it was to write lawes to men whose hearts were not first season'd with the knowledge of God and of his workes, began from the book of Genesis, as a prologue to his lawes; which Josephus right well hath noted. That the nation of the Jewes, reading therein the universall goodnesse of God to all creatures in the Creation, and his peculiar favour to them in his election of Abraham their ancestor, from whom they could derive so many blessings upon themselves, might be mov'd to obey sincerely by knowing so good a reason of their obedience. If then in the administration of civill justice, and under the obscurity of Ceremoniall rites, such care was had by the wisest of the heathen, and by Moses among the Jewes, to instruct them at least in a generall reason of that government to which their subjection was requir'd, how much more ought the members of the Church under the Gospell seeke to their understanding in the reason of that government which the Church claimes to have over them: especially for that the Church hath in her immediate cure those inner parts and affections of the mind where the seat of reason is; having power to examine our spirituall knowledge, and to demand from us in Gods behalfe a service intirely reasonable. But because about the manner and order of this government, whether it ought to be Presbyteriall, or Prelaticall, such endlesse question, or rather uproare is arisen in this land, as may be justly term'd, what the feaver is to the Physitians, the eternall reproach of our Divines; whilest other profound Clerks of late greatly, as they conceive, to the advancement of Prelaty, are so earnestly meting out the Lydian proconsular Asia, to make good the prime metropolis of Ephesus, as if some of our Prelates in all haste meant to change their soile, and become neighbours to the English Bishop of Chalcedon; and whilest good Breerwood as busily bestirres himselfe in our vulgar tongue to divide precisely the three Patriarchats, of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, and whether to any of these England doth belong, I shall in the meane while not cease to hope through the mercy and grace of Christ, the head and husband of his Church, that England shortly is to belong, neither to See Patriarchall, nor See Prelaticall, but to the faithfull feeding and disciplining of that ministeriall order, which the blessed Apostles constituted throughout the Churches: and this I shall assay to prove can be no other, then that of Presbyters and Deacons. And if any man incline to thinke I undertake a taske too difficult for my yeares, I trust through the supreme inlightning assistance farre otherwise; for my yeares, be they few or many, what imports it? So they bring reason, let that be lookt on: and for the task, from hence that the question in hand is so needfull to be known at this time chiefly by every meaner capacity, and containes in it the explication of many admirable and heavenly privileges reacht out to us by the Gospell, I conclude the task must be easie. God having to this end ordain'd his Gospell to be the revelation of his power and wisdome in Christ Jesus. And this is one depth of his wisdome, that he could so plainly reveale so great a measure of it to the grosse distorted apprehension of decay'd mankinde. Let others therefore dread and shun the Scriptures for their darknesse, I shall wish I may deserve to be reckon'd among those who admire and dwell upon them for their clearnesse. And this seemes to be the cause why in those places of holy writ, wherein is treated of Church-government, the reasons thereof are not formally, and profestly set downe, because to him that heeds attentively the drift and scope of Christian profession, they easily imply themselves, which thing further to explane, having now prefac'd enough, I shall no longer deferre.

CHAP. I.

That Church-governement is prescrib'd in the Gospell, and that to say otherwise is unsound.

The first and greatest reason of Church-government, we may securely with the assent of many on the adverse part, affirme to be, because we finde it so ordain'd and set out to us by the appointment of God in the Scriptures; but whether this be Presbyteriall, or Prelaticall, it cannot be brought to the scanning, untill I have said what is meet to some who do not think it for the ease of their inconsequent opinions, to grant that Church discipline is platform'd in the Bible, but that it is left to the discretion of men. To this conceit of theirs I answer, that it is both unsound and untrue. For there is not that thing in the world of more grave and urgent importance throughout the whole life of man, then is discipline. What need I instance? He that hath read with judgement, of Nations and Commonwealths, of Cities and Camps, of peace and warre, sea and land, will readily agree that the flourishing and decaying of all civill societies, all the moments and turnings of humane occasions are mov'd to and fro as upon the axle of discipline. So that whatsoever power or sway in mortall things weaker men have attributed to fortune, I durst with more confidence (the honour of divine providence ever sav'd) ascribe either to the vigor, or the slacknesse of discipline. Nor is there any sociable perfection in this life civill or sacred that can be above discipline, but she is that which with her musicall cords preserves and holds all the parts thereof together. Hence in those perfect armies of Cyrus in Xenophon, and Scipio in the Roman stories, the excellence of military skill was esteem'd, not by the not needing, but by the readiest submitting to the edicts of their commander. And certainly discipline is not only the removall of disorder, but if any visible shape can be given to divine things, the very visible shape and image of vertue, whereby she is not only seene in the regular gestures and motions of her heavenly paces as she walkes, but also makes the harmony of her voice audible to mortall eares. Yea the Angels themselves, in whom no disorder is fear'd, as the Apostle that saw them in his rapture describes, are distinguisht and quaterniond into their celestiall Princedomes, and Satrapies, according as God himselfe hath writ his imperiall decrees through the great provinces of heav'n. The state also of the blessed in Paradise, though never so perfect, is not therefore left without discipline, whose golden survaying reed marks out and measures every quarter and circuit of new Jerusalem. Yet is it not to be conceiv'd that those eternall effluences of sanctity and love in the glorified Saints should by this meanes be confin'd and cloy'd with repetition of that which is prescrib'd, but that our happinesse may orbe it selfe into a thousand vagancies of glory and delight, and with a kinde of eccentricall equation be as it were an invariable Planet of joy and felicity, how much lesse can we believe that God would leave his fraile and feeble, though not lesse beloved Church here below to the perpetuall stumble of conjecture and disturbance in this our darke voyage without the card and compasse of Discipline. Which is so hard to be of mans making, that we may see even in the guidance of a civill state to worldly happinesse, it is not for every learned, or every wise man, though many of them consult in common, to invent or frame a discipline, but if it be at all the worke of man, it must be of such a one as is a true knower of himselfe, and himselfe in whom contemplation and practice, wit, prudence, fortitude, and eloquence must be rarely met, both to comprehend the hidden causes of things, and span in his thoughts all the various effects that passion or complexion can worke in mans nature; and hereto must his hand be at defiance with gaine, and his heart in all vertues heroick. So far is it from the kenne of these wretched projectors of ours that bescraull their Pamflets every day with new formes of government for our Church. And therefore all the ancient lawgivers were either truly inspir'd as Moses, or were such men as with authority anough might give it out to be so, as Minos, Lycurgus, Numa, because they wisely forethought that men would never quietly submit to such a discipline as had not more of Gods hand in it then mans. To come within the narrownesse of houshold government, observation will shew us many deepe counsellers of state and judges to demean themselves incorruptly in the setl'd course of affaires, and many worthy Preachers upright in their lives, powerfull in their audience; but look upon either of these men where they are left to their own disciplining at home, and you shall soone perceive for all their single knowledge and uprightnesse, how deficient they are in the regulating of their own family; not only in what may concerne the vertuous and decent composure of their minds in their severall places, but that which is of a lower and easier performance, the right possessing of the outward vessell, their body, in health or sicknesse, rest or labour, diet, or abstinence, whereby to render it more pliant to the soule, and usefull to the Common-wealth: which if men were but as good to discipline themselves, as some are to tutor their Horses and Hawks, it could not be so grosse in most housholds. If then it appear so hard and so little knowne, how to governe a house well, which is thought of so easie discharge, and for every mans undertaking, what skill of man, what wisdome, what parts, can be sufficient to give lawes & ordinances to the elect houshold of God? If we could imagine that he had left it at randome without his provident and gracious ordering, who is he so arrogant so presumptuous that durst dispose and guide the living arke of the holy Ghost, though he should finde it wandring in the field of Bethshemesh, without the conscious warrant of some high calling. But no profane insolence can paralell that which our Prelates dare avouch, to drive outragiously, and shatter the holy arke of the Church, not born upon their shoulders with pains and labour in the word, but drawne with rude oxen their officials, and their owne brute inventions. Let them make shewes of reforming while they will, so long as the Church is mounted upon the Prelaticall Cart, and not as it ought betweene the hands of the Ministers, it will but shake and totter, and he that sets to his hand though with a good intent to hinder the shogging of it, in this unlawfull waggonry wherein it rides, let him beware it be not fatall to him as it was to Uzza. Certainly if God be the father of his family the Church, wherein could he expresse that name more, then in training it up under his owne all-wise and dear Oeconomy, not turning it loose to the havock of strangers and wolves that would ask no better plea then this to doe in the Church of Christ, what ever humour faction, policy, or licentious will would prompt them to. Againe, if Christ be the Churches husband expecting her to be presented before him a pure unspotted virgin; in what could he shew his tender love to her more, then in prescribing his owne wayes which he best knew would be to the improvement of her health and beauty with much greater care doubtlesse then the Persian King could appoint for his Queene Esther those maiden dietings & set prescriptions of baths, & odors, which may render her at last the more amiable to his eye. For of any age or sex, most unfitly may a virgin be left to an uncertaine and arbitrary education. Yea though she be well instructed, yet is she still under a more strait tuition, especially if betroth'd. In like manner the Church bearing the same resemblance, it were not reason to think she should be left destitute of that care which is as necessary, and proper to her, as instruction. For publick preaching indeed is the gift of the Spirit working as best seemes to his secret will, but discipline is the practick work of preaching directed and apply'd as is most requisite to particular duty; without which it were all one to the benefit of souls, as it would be to the cure of bodies, if all the Physitians in London should get into the severall Pulpits of the City, and assembling all the diseased in every parish should begin a learned Lecture of Pleurisies, Palsies, Lethargies, to which perhaps none there present were inclin'd, and so without so much as feeling one puls, or giving the least order to any skilfull Apothecary, should dismisse 'em from time to time, some groaning, some languishing, some expiring, with this only charge to look well to themselves, and do as they heare. Of what excellence and necessity then Church-discipline is, how beyond the faculty of man to frame, and how dangerous to be left to mans invention who would be every foot turning it to sinister ends, how properly also it is the worke of God as father, and of Christ as Husband of the Church; we have by thus much heard.

CHAP. II.

That Church governement is set downe in holy Scripture, and that to say otherwise is untrue.

As therefore it is unsound to say that God hath not appointed any set government in his Church, so is it untrue. Of the time of the Law there can be no doubt; for to let passe the first institution of Priests and Levites, which is too cleare to be insisted upon, when the Temple came to be built, which in plaine judgement could breed no essentiall change either in religion, or in the Priestly government; yet God to shew how little he could endure that men should be tampring and contriving in his worship, though in things of lesse regard, gave to David for Solomon not only a pattern and modell of the Temple, but a direction for the courses of the Priests and Levites, and for all the worke of their service. At the returne from the Captivity things were only restor'd after the ordinance of Moses and David; or if the least alteration be to be found, they had with them inspired men, Prophets, and it were not sober to say they did ought of moment without divine intimation. In the Prophesie of Ez-kiel from the 40 Chapt. onward, after the destruction of the Temple, God by his Prophet seeking to weane the hearts of the Jewes from their old law to expect a new and more perfect reformation under Christ, sets out before their eyes the stately fabrick & constitution of his Church, with al the ecclesiasticall functions appertaining; indeed the description is as sorted best to the apprehension of those times, typicall and shadowie, but in such manner as never yet came to passe, nor never must literally, unlesse we mean to annihilat the Gospel. But so exquisit and lively the description is in portraying the new state of the Church, and especially in those points where government seemes to be most active, that both Jewes and Gentiles might have good cause to be assur'd, that God when ever he meant to reforme his Church, never intended to leave the governement thereof delineated here in such curious architecture, to be patch't afterwards, and varnish't over with the devices and imbellishings of mans imagination. Did God take such delight in measuring out the pillars, arches, and doores of a materiall Temple, was he so punctuall and circumspect in lavers, altars, and sacrifices soone after to be abrogated, lest any of these should have beene made contrary to his minde? is not a farre more perfect worke more agreeable to his perfection in the most perfect state of the Church militant, the new alliance of God to man? should not he rather now by his owne prescribed discipline have cast his line and levell upon the soule of man which is his rationall temple, and by the divine square and compasse thereof forme and regenerate in us the lovely shapes of vertues and graces, the sooner to edifie and accomplish that immortall stature of Christs body which is his Church, in all her glorious lineaments and proportions. And that this indeed God hath done for us in the Gospel we shall see with open eyes, not under a vaile. We may passe over the history of the Acts and other places, turning only to those Epistles of S. Paul to Timothy and Titus: where the spirituall eye may discerne more goodly and gracefully erected then all the magnificence of Temple or Tabernacle, such a heavenly structure of evangelick discipline so diffusive of knowledge and charity to the prosperous increase and growth of the Church, that it cannot be wonder'd if that elegant and artfull symmetry of the promised new temple in Ezekiel, and all those sumptuous things under the Law were made to signifie the inward beauty and splendor of the Christian Church thus govern'd. And whether this be commanded let it now be judg'd. S. Paul after his preface to the first of Timothy which hee concludes in the 17 Verse with Amen, enters upon the subject of his Epistle which is to establish the Church-government with a command. This charge I commit to thee son Timothy: according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them might'st war a good warfare. Which is plain enough thus expounded. This charge I commit to thee wherein I now go about to instruct thee how thou shalt set up Church-discipline, that thou might'st warre a good warfare, bearing thy selfe constantly and faithfully in the Ministery, which in the I to the Corinthians is also call'd a warfare: and so after a kinde of Parenthesis concerning Hymenæus he returnes to his command though under the milde word of exhorting, Cap.2.v.I. I exhort therefore. As if he had interrupted his former command by the occasionall mention of Hymenaeus. More beneath in the 14 V. of the 3 C. when he hath deliver'd the duties of Bishops or Presbyters and Deacons not once naming any other order in the Church, he thus addes. These things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly (such necessity it seems there was) but if I tarry long, that thou mai'st know how thou ought'st to behave thy selfe in the house of God. From this place it may be justly ask't, whether Timothy by this here written might know what was to be knowne concerning the orders of Church governours or no? If he might, then in such a cleere text as this may we know too without further jangle; if he might not, then did S. Paul write insufficiently, and moreover said not true, for he saith here he might know, and I perswade my selfe he did know ere this was written, but that the Apostle had more regard to the instruction of us, then to the informing of him. In the fifth Chap. after some other Church precepts concerning discipline, mark what a dreadfull command followes, Verse 21. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou observe these things, and as if all were not yet sure anough, he closes up the Epistle with an adjuring charge thus. I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, that thou keepe this commandement: that is the whole commandement concerning discipline, being the maine purpose of the Epistle: although Hooker would faine have this denouncement referr'd to the particular precept going before, because the word Commandement is in the singular number, not remembring that even in the first Chapt. of this Epistle, the word Commandement is us'd in a plurall sense, Vers. 5. Now the end of the Commandement is charity. And what more frequent then in like manner to say the Law of Moses. So that either to restraine the significance too much, or too much to inlarg it would make the adjuration either not so waighty, or not so pertinent. And thus we find here that the rules of Church-discipline are not only commanded, but hedg'd about with such a terrible impalement of commands, as he that will break through wilfully to violate the least of them, must hazard the wounding of his conscience even to death. Yet all of this notwithstanding we shall finde them broken wellnigh all by the faire pretenders even of the next ages. No lesse to the contempt of him whom they fain to be the archfounder of prelaty S. Peter, who by what he writes in the 5 Chap. of his first Epistle should seeme to be farre another man then tradition reports him: there he commits to the Presbyters only full authority both of feeding the flock, and Episcopating: and commands that obedience be given to them as to the mighty hand of God, wch is his mighty ordinance. Yet all this was as nothing to repell the ventrous boldnesse of innovation that ensu'd, changing the decrees of God that is immutable, as if they had been breath'd by man. Neverthelesse when Christ by those visions of S. John foreshewes the reformation of his Church, he bids him take his Reed and meet it out againe after the first patterne, for he prescribes him no other. Arise, said the Angell, and measure the Temple of God and the Altar, and them that worship therein. What is there in the world can measure men but discipline? Our word ruling imports no lesse. Doctrine indeed is the measure, or at least the reason of the measure, tis true, but unlesse the measure be apply'd to that which it is to measure, how can it actually doe its proper worke. Whether therefore discipline be all one with doctrine, or the particular application thereof to this or that person, we all agree that doctrine must be such only as is commanded; or whether it be something really differing from doctrine, yet was it only of Gods appointment, as being the most adequat measure of the Church and her children, which is here the office of a great Evangelist and the reed given him from heaven. But that part of the Temple which is not thus measur'd, so farre is it from being in Gods tuition or delight, that in the following verse he rejects it, however in shew and visibility it may seeme a part of his Church, yet in as much as it lyes thus unmeasur'd he leaves it to be trampl'd by the Gentiles, that is to be polluted with idolatrous and Gentilish rites and ceremonies. And that the principall reformation here foretold is already come to passe as well in discipline as in doctrine the state of our neighbour Churches afford us to behold. Thus through all the periods and changes of the Church it hath beene prov'd that God hath still reserv'd to himselfe the right of enacting Church-government.

CHAP. III.

That it is dangerous and unworthy the Gospell to hold that Church-government is to be pattern'd by the Law, as B. Andrews and the Primat of Armagh maintaine.

We may returne now from this interposing difficulty thus remov'd, to affirme, that since Church-government is so strictly commanded in Gods Word, the first and greatest reason why we should submit thereto, is because God hath so commanded. But whether of these two, Prelaty or Presbytery can prove it selfe to be supported by this first and greatest reason, must be the next dispute. Wherein this position is to be first layd down as granted; that I may not follow a chase rather then an argument, that one of these two, and none other is of Gods ordaining, and if it be, that ordinance must be evident in the Gospell. For the imperfect and obscure institution of the Law, which the Apostles themselves doubt not oft-times to vilifie, cannot give rules to the compleat and glorious ministration of the Gospell, which lookes on the Law, as on a childe, not as on a tutor. And that the Prelates have no sure foundation in the Gospell, their own guiltinesse doth manifest: they would not else run questing up as high as Adam to fetch their originall, as tis said one of them lately did in publick. To which assertion, had I heard it, because I see they are so insatiable of antiquity, I should have gladly assented, and confest them yet more ancient. For Lucifer before Adam was the first prelat Angel, and both he, as is commonly thought, and our forefather Adam, as we all know, for aspiring above their orders, were miserably degraded. But others better advis'd are content to receive their beginning from Aaron and his sons, among whom B. Andrews of late yeares, and in these times the Primat of Armagh for their learning are reputed the best able to say what may be said in this opinion. The Primat in his discourse about the originall of Episcopacy newly revis'd begins thus. The ground of Episcopacy is fetcht partly from the pattern prescrib'd by God in the Old Testament, and partly from the imitation thereof brought in by the Apostles. Herein I must entreat to be excus'd of the desire I have to be satisfi'd, how for example the ground of Episcop. is fetch't partly from the example of the old Testament, by whom next, and by whose authority. Secondly, how the Church-government under the Gospell can be rightly call'd an imitation of that in the old Testament? for that the Gospell is the end and fulfilling of the Law, our liberty also from the bondage of the Law I plainly reade. How then the ripe age of the Gospell should be put to schoole againe, and learn to governe her selfe from the infancy of the Law, the stronger to imitate the weaker, the freeman to follow the captive, the learned to be lesson'd by the rude, will be a hard undertaking to evince from any of those principles which either art or inspiration hath written. If any thing done by the Apostles may be drawne howsoever to a likenesse of something Mosaicall, if it cannot be prov'd that it was done of purpose in imitation, as having the right thereof grounded in nature, and not in ceremony or type, it will little availe the matter. The whole Judaick law is either politicall, and to take pattern by that, no Christian nation ever thought it selfe oblig'd in conscience; or morall, which containes in it the observation of whatsoever is substantially, and perpetually true and good, either in religion, or course of life. That which is thus morall, besides what we fetch from those unwritten lawes and Ideas which nature hath ingraven in us, the Gospell, as stands with her dignity most, lectures to us from her own authentick hand-writing and command, not copies out from the borrow'd manuscript of a subservient scrowl, by way of imitating. As well might she be said in her Sacrament of water to imitate the baptisme of Iohn. What though she retaine excommunication us'd in the Synagogue, retain the morality of the Sabbath, she does not therefore imitate the law her underling, but perfect her. All that was morally deliver'd from the law to the Gospell in the office of the Priests and Levites, was that there should be a ministery set a part to teach and discipline the Church, both which duties the Apostles thought good to commit to the Presbyters. And if any distinction of honour were to be made among them, they directed it should be to those not that only rule well, but especially to those that labour in the word and doctrine. By which we are taught that laborious teaching is the most honourable Prelaty that one Minister can have above another in the Gospell: if therefore the superiority of Bishopship be grounded on the Priesthood as part of the morall law, it cannot be said to be an imitation; for it were ridiculous that morality should imitate morality, which ever was the same thing. This very word of patterning or imitating excludes Episcopacy from the solid and grave Ethicall law, and betraies it to be a meere childe of ceremony, or likelier some misbegotten thing, that having pluckt the gay feathers of her obsolet bravery to hide her own deformed barenesse, now vaunts and glories in her stolne plumes. In the meane while what danger there is against the very life of the Gospell to make in any thing the typical law her pattern, and how impossible in that which touches the Priestly government, I shall use such light as I have receav'd, to lay open. It cannot be unknowne by what expressions the holy Apostle S. Paul spares not to explane to us the nature and condition of the law, calling those ordinances which were the chiefe and essentiall offices of the Priests, the elements and rudiments of the world both weake and beggarly. Now to breed, and bring up the children of the promise, the heirs of liberty and grace under such a kinde of government as is profest to be but an imitation of that ministery which engender'd to bondage the sons of Agar, how can this be but a foul injury and derogation, if not a cancelling of that birth-right and immunity which Christ hath purchas'd for us with his blood. For the ministration of the law consisting of carnall things, drew to it such a ministery as consisted of carnall respects, dignity, precedence, and the like. And such a ministery establish't in the Gospell, as is founded upon the points and termes of superiority, and nests it selfe in worldly honours, will draw to it, and we see it doth, such a religion as runnes back againe to the old pompe and glory of the flesh. For doubtlesse there is a certaine attraction and magnetick force betwixt the religion and the ministeriall forme thereof. If the religion be pure, spirituall, simple, and lowly, as the Gospel most truly is, such must the face of the ministery be. And in like manner if the forme of the Ministery be grounded in the worldly degrees of autority, honour, temporall jurisdiction, we see it with our eyes it will turne the inward power and purity of the Gospel into the outward carnality of the law; evaporating and exhaling the internall worship into empty conformities, and gay shewes. And what remains then but that wee should runne into as dangerous and deadly apostacy as our lamented neighbours the Papists, who by this very snare and pitfall of imitating the ceremonial law, fel into that irrecoverable superstition, as must needs make void the cov'nant of salvation to them that persist in this blindnesse.

CHAP. IV.

That it is impossible to make the Priesthood of Aaron a pattern whereon to ground Episcopacy.

That which was promis'd next, is to declare the impossibility of grounding Evangelick government in the imitation of the Jewish Priesthood: which will be done by considering both the quality of the persons, and the office it selfe. Aaron and his sonnes were the Princes of their Tribe before they were sanctified to the Priesthood: that personall eminence which they held above the other Levites, they receav'd not only from their office, but partly brought it into their office: and so from that time forward the Priests were not chosen out of the whole number of the Levites, as our Bishops, but were borne inheritors of the dignity. Therefore unlesse we shall choose our Prelats only out of the Nobility, and let them runne in a blood, there can be no possible imitation of Lording over their brethren in regard of their persons altogether unlike. As for the office wch was a representation of Christs own person more immediately in the high Priest, & of his whole priestly office in all the other; to the performanoe of wch the Levits were but as servitors & Deacons, it was necessary there should be a distinction of dignity betweene two functions of so great ods. But there being no such difference among our Ministers, unlesse it be in reference to the Deacons, it is impossible to found a Prelaty upon the imitation of this Priesthood. For wherein, or in what worke is the office of a Prelat excellent above that of a Pastor? in ordination you'l say; but flatly against Scripture, for there we know Timothy receav'd ordination by the hands of the Presbytery, notwithstanding all the vaine delusions that are us'd to evade that testimony, and maintaine an unwarrantable usurpation. But wherefore should ordination be a cause of setting up a superior degree in the Church? is not that whereby Christ became our Saviour a higher and greater worke, then that whereby he did ordaine messengers to preach and publish him our Saviour? Every Minister sustains the person of Christ in his highest work of communicating to us the mysteries of our salvation, and hath the power of binding and absolving, how should he need a higher dignity to represent or execute that which is an inferior work in Christ? why should the performance of ordination which is a lower office exalt a Prelat, and not the seldome discharge of a higher and more noble office wch is preaching and administring much rather depresse him? Verily neither the nature, nor the example of ordination doth any way require an imparity betweene the ordainer and the ordained. For what more naturall then every like to produce his like, man to beget man, fire to propagate fire, and in examples of highest opinion the ordainer is inferior to the ordained; for the Pope is not made by the precedent Pope, but by Cardinals, who ordain and consecrate to a higher and greater office then their own.

CHAP. V.

To the Arguments of B. Andrews and the Primat.

It followes here to attend to certaine objections in a little treatise lately printed among others of like sort at Oxford, and in the title said to be out of the rude draughts of Bishop Andrews. And surely they bee rude draughts indeed, in so much that it is marvell to think what his friends meant to let come abroad such shallow reasonings with the name of a man so much bruited for learning. In the 12 and 23 pages he seemes most notoriously inconstant to himselfe; for in the former place he tels us he forbeares to take any argument of Prelaty from Aaron, as being the type of Christ. In the latter he can forbeare no longer, but repents him of his rash gratuity, affirming, that to say, Christ being come in the flesh, his figure in the high Priest ceaseth, is the shift of an Anabaptist; and stiffly argues that Christ being as well King as Priest, was as well fore-resembled by the Kings then, as by the high Priest. So that if his comming take away the one type, it must also the other. Marvellous piece of divinity! and well worth that the land should pay six thousand pound a yeare for, in a Bishoprick, although I reade of no Sophister among the Greeks that was so dear, neither Hippias nor Protagoras, nor any whom the Socratick schoole famously refuted with out hire. Here we have the type of the King sow'd to the typet of the Bishop, suttly to cast a jealousie upon the Crowne, as if the right of Kings, like Meleager in the Metamorphosis, were no longer liv'd then the firebrand of Prelaty. But more likely the Prelatss fearing (for their own guilty carriage protests they doe feare) that their faire dayes cannot long hold, practize by possessing the King with this most false doctrine, to ingage his power for them, as in his owne quarrell, that when they fall they may fall in a generall ruine, just as cruell Tyberius would wish,

When I dye, let the earth be roul'd in flames.

But where, O Bishop, doth the purpose of the law set forth Christ to us as a King? That which never was intended in the Law, can never be abolish't as part thereof. When the Law was made, there was no King: if before the law, or under the law God by a speciall type in any King would foresignifie the future kingdome of Christ, which is not yet visibly come, what was that to the law? The whole ceremoniall law, and types can be in no law else, comprehends nothing but the propitiatory office of Christs Priesthood, which being in substance accomplisht, both law and Priesthood fades away of it selfe, and passes into aire like a transitory vision, and the right of Kings neither stands by any type nor falls. We acknowledge that the civill magistrate weares an autority of Gods giving, and ought to be obey'd as his vicegerent. But to make a King a type, we say is an abusive and unskilfull speech, and of a morall solidity makes it seeme a ceremoniall shadow. Therefore your typical chaine of King and Priest must unlink. But is not the type of Priest taken away by Christs comming? no saith this famous Protestant Bishop of Winchester; it is not, and he that saith it is, is an Anabaptist. What think ye Readers, do ye not understand him? What can be gather'd hence but that the Prelat would still sacrifice? conceave him readers, he would missificate. Their altars indeed were in a fair forwardnesse; and by such arguments as these they were setting up the molten Calfe of their Masse againe, and of their great Hierarch the Pope. For if the type of Priest be not taken away, then neither of the high Priest, it were a strange beheading; and high Priest more then one there cannot be, and that one can be no lesse then a Pope. And this doubtlesse was the bent of his career, though never so covertly. Yea but there was something else in the high Priest besides the figure, as is plain by S. Pauls acknowledging him. Tis true that in the 17 of Deut. whence this autority arises to the Priest in matters too hard for the secular judges, as must needs be many in the occasions of those times involv'd so with ceremoniall niceties, no wonder though it be commanded to enquire at the mouth of the Priests, who besides the Magistrates their collegues had the Oracle of Urim to consult with. And whether the high Priest Ananias had not incroach't beyond the limits of his Priestly autority, or whether us'd it rightly, was no time then for S. Paul to contest about. But if this instance be able to assert any right of jurisdiction to the Clergy, it must impart it in common to all Ministers, since it were a great folly to seeke for counsell in a hard intricat scruple from a Dunce Prelat, when there might be found a speedier solution from a grave and learned Minister, whom God hath gifted with the judgement of Urim more amply oft-times then all the Prelates together; and now in the Gospell hath granted the privilege of this oraculous Ephod alike to all his Ministers. The reason therefore of imparity in the Priests, being now as is aforesaid, really annull'd both in their person, and in their representative office, what right of jurisdiction soever can be from this place Levitically bequeath'd, must descend upon the Ministers of the Gospell equally, as it findes them in all other points equall. Well then he is finally content to let Aaron go. Eleazar will serve his turne, as being a superior of superiors, and yet no type of Christ in Aarons life time. O thou that would'st winde into any figment, or phantasme to save thy Miter! Yet all this will not fadge, though it be cunningly interpolisht by some second hand with crooks & emendations; Heare then; the type of Christ in some one particular, as of entring yearly into the Holy of holies and such like, rested upon the High Priest only as more immediately personating our Saviour: but to resemble his whole satisfactory office all the lineage of Aaron was no more then sufficient. And all, or any of the Priests, consider'd separately without relation to the highest, are but as a livelesse trunk and signfie nothing. And this shewes the excellence of Christs sacrifice, who at once and in one person fulfill'd that which many hunderds of Priests many times repeating had anough to forshew. What other imparity there was among themselves, we may safely suppose it depended on the dignity of their birth and family, together with the circumstances of a carnall service, which might afford many priorities. And this I take to be the summe of what the Bishop hath laid together to make plea for Prelaty by imitation of the Law. Though indeed, if it may stand, it will inferre Popedome all as well. Many other courses he tries, enforcing himselfe with much ostentation of endlesse genealogies, as if he were the man that S. Paul forewarnes us of in Timothy, but so unvigorously, that I do not feare his winning of many to his cause, but such as doting upon great names are either over-weake, or over sudden of faith. I shall not refuse therefore to learne so much prudence as I finde in the Roman Souldier that attended the crosse, not to stand breaking of legs, when the breath is quite out of the body, but passe to that which follows. The Primat of Armagh at the beginning of his tractat seeks to availe himselfe of that place in the 66 of Esaiah, I will take of them for Priests and Levites, saith the Lord; to uphold hereby such a forme of superiority among the ministers of the Gospell succeeding those in the law, as the Lords day did the Sabbath. But certain if this method may be admitted of interpreting those propheticall passages concerning Christian times in a punctuall correspondence, it may with equall probability be urg'd upon us, that we are bound to observe some monthly solemnity answerable to the new moons, as well as the Lords day which we keepe in lieu of the Sabbath: for in the 23 v. the Prophet joynes them in the same manner together, as before he did the Priests and Levites, thus. And it shall come to passe that from one new moone to another, and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. Undoubtedly with as good consequence may it be alledg'd from hence, that we are to solemnize some religious monthly meeting different from the Sabbath, as from the other any distinct formality of Ecclesiasticall orders may be inferr'd. This rather will appeare to be the lawfull and unconstrain'd sense of the text, that God in taking of them for Priests and Levites, will not esteeme them unworthy though Gentiles, to undergoe any function in the Church, but will make of them a full and perfect ministery, as was that of the Priests and Levites in their kinde. And Bishop Andrews himselfe to end the controversie, sends us a candid exposition of this quoted verse from the 24 page of his said book, plainly deciding that God by those legall names there of Priests and Levites means our Presbyters, and Deacons, for which either ingenuous confession, or slip of his pen we give him thanks, and withall to him that brought these treatises into one volume, who setting the contradictions of two learned men so neere together, did not foresee. What other deducements or analogies are cited out of S. Paul to prove a likenesse betweene the Ministers of the Old and New Testament, having tri'd their sinewes I judge they may passe without harme doing to our cause. We may remember then that Prelaty neither hath nor can have foundation in the law, nor yet in the Gospell, which assertion as being for the plainnesse thereof a matter of eye sight, rather then of disquisition I voluntarily omitt, not forgetting to specifie this note againe, that the earnest desire which the Prelates have to build their Hierarchy upon the sandy bottome of the law, gives us to see abundantly the little assurance which they finde to reare up their high roofs by the autority of the Gospell, repulst as it were from the writings of the Apostles, and driven to take sanctuary among the Jewes. Hence that open confession of the Primat before mention'd. Episcopacy is fetcht partly from the patterne of the Old Testament, & partly from the New as an imitation of the Old, though nothing can be more rotten in Divinity then such a position as this, and is all one as to say Episcopacy is partly of divine institution, and partly of mans own carving. For who gave the autority to fetch more from the patterne of the law then what the Apostles had already fetcht, if they fetcht any thing at all, as hath beene prov'd they did not. So was Jereboams Episcopacy partly from the patterne of the law, and partly from the patterne of his owne carnality; a parti-colour'd and a parti-member'd Episcopacy, and what can this be lesse then a monstrous? Others therefore among the Prelats perhaps not so well able to brook, or rather to justifie this foule relapsing to the old law, have condiscended at last to a plaine confessing that both the names and offices of Bishops and Presbyters at first were the same, and in the Scriptures no where distinguisht. This grants the remonstrant in the fift Section of his defence, and in the Preface to his last short answer. But what need respect be had whether he grant or grant it not, when as through all antiquity, and even in the loftiest times of Prelaty we find it granted. Jerome the learned'st of the Fathers hides not his opinion, that custome only, which the Proverbe cals a tyrant, was the maker of Prelaty; before his audacious workmanship the Churches were rul'd in common by the Presbyters. and such a certaine truth this was esteem'd, that it became a decree among the Papall Canons compil'd by Gratian. Anselme also of Canturbury, who to uphold the points of his Prelatisme made himselfe a traytor to his country, yet commenting the Epistles to Titus and the Philippians acknowledges from the cleernesse of the text, what Ierome and the Church Rubrick hath before acknowledg'd. He little dreamt then that the weeding-hook of reformation would after two ages pluck up his glorious poppy from insulting over the good corne. Though since some of our Brittish Prelates seeing themselves prest to produce Scripture, try all their cunning, if the New Testament will not help them, to frame of their own heads as it were with wax a kind of Mimick Bishop limm'd out to the life of a dead Priesthood. Or else they would straine us out a certaine figurative Prelat, by wringing the collective allegory of those seven Angels into seven single Rochets. Howsoever since it thus appeares that custome was the creator of Prelaty being lesse ancient then the government of Presbyters, it is an extreme folly to give them the hearing that tell us of Bishops through so many ages: and if against their tedious muster of citations, Sees, and successions, it be reply'd that wagers and Church antiquities, such as are repugnant to the plaine dictat of Scripture are both alike the arguments of fooles, they have their answer. We rather are to cite all those ages to an arraignment before the word of God, wherefore, and what pretending, how presuming they durst alter that divine institution of Presbyters, which the Apostles who were no various and inconstant men surely had set up in the Churches, and why they choose to live by custome and catalogue, or as S. Paul saith by sight and visibility, rather then by faith? But first I conclude from their owne mouthes that Gods command in Scripture, which doubtlesse ought to be the first and greatest reason of Church-government, is wanting to Prelaty. And certainly we have plenteous warrant in the doctrine of Christ to determine that the want of this reason is of it selfe sufficient to confute all other presences that may be brought in favour of it.

CHAP. VI.

That Prelaty was not set up for prevention of Schisme, as is pretended, or if it were, that it performes not what it was first set up for, but quite the contrary.

Yet because it hath the outside of a specious reason, & specious things we know are aptest to worke with humane lightnesse and frailty, even against the solidest truth, that sounds not plausibly, let us think it worth the examining for the love of infirmer Christians, of what importance this their second reason may be. Tradition they say hath taught them that for the prevention of growing schisme the Bishop was heav'd above the Presbyter. And must tradition then ever thus to the worlds end be the perpetuall canker-worme to eat out Gods Commandements? are his decrees so inconsiderate and so fickle, that when the statutes of Solon, or Lycurgus shall prove durably good to many ages, his in 40 yeares shall be found defective, ill contriv'd, and for needfull causes to be alter'd? Our Saviour and his Apostles did not only foresee, but foretell and forewarne us to looke for schisme. Is it a thing to be imagin'd of Gods wisdome, or at least of Apostolick prudence to set up such a government in the tendernesse of the Church, as should incline, or not be more able then any other to oppose it selfe to schisme? it was well knowne what a bold lurker schisme was even in the houshold of Christ betweene his owne Disciples and those of Iohn the Baptist about fasting: and early in the Acts of the Apostles the noise of schisme had almost drown'd the proclaiming of the Gospell; yet we reade not in Scripture that any thought was had of making Prelates, no not in those places where dissention was most rife. If Prelaty had beene then esteeem'd a remedy against schisme, where was it more needfull then in that great variance among the Corinthians which S. Paul so labour'd to reconcile? and whose eye could have found the fittest remedy sooner then his? and what could have made the remedy more available, then to have us'd it speedily? and lastly what could have beene more necessary then to have written it for our instruction? yet we see he neither commended it to us, nor us'd it himselfe. For the same division remaining there, or else bursting forth againe more then 20 yeares after S. Pauls death, wee finde in Clements Epistle of venerable autority written to the yet factious Corinthians, that they were still govern'd by Presbyters. And the same of other Churches out of Hermas, >and divers other the scholers of the Apostles by the late industry of the learned Salmatius appeares. Neither yet did this worthy Clement S. Pauls disciple, though writing to them to lay aside schisme, in the least word advise them to change the Presbyteriall government into Prelaty. And therefore if God afterward gave, or permitted this insurrection of Episcopacy, it is to be fear'd he did it in his wrath, as he gave the Israelites a King. With so good a will doth he use to alter his own chosen government once establish'd. For marke whether this rare device of mans braine thus preferr'd before the ordinance of God, had better successe then fleshly wisdome not counseling with God is wont to have. So farre was it from removing schisme, that if schisme parted the congregations before, now it rent and mangl'd, now it rag'd. Heresie begat heresie with a certaine monstrous haste of pregnancy in her birth, at once borne and bringing forth. Contentions before brotherly were now hostile. Men went to choose their Bishop as they went to a pitcht field, and the day of his election was like the sacking of a City, sometimes ended with the blood of thousands. Nor this among hereticks only, but men of the same beliefe, yea confessors, and that with such odious ambition, that Eusebius in his eighth book testifies he abhorr'd to write. And the reason is not obscure, for the poore dignity or rather burden of a Parochial Presbyter could not ingage any great party, nor that to any deadly feud: but Prelaty was a power of that extent, and sway, that if her election were popular, it was seldome not the cause of some faction or broil in the Church. But if her dignity came by favour of some Prince, she was from that time his creature, and obnoxious to comply with his ends in state were they right or wrong. So that in stead of finding Prelaty an impeacher of Schisme or faction, the more I search, the more I grow into all perswasion to think rather that faction and she as with a spousall ring are wedded together, never to be divorc't. But here let every one behold the just, and dreadfull judgement of God meeting with the audacious pride of man that durst offer to mend the ordinances of heaven. God out of the strife of men brought forth by his Apostles to the Church that beneficent and ever distributing office of Deacons, the stewards and Ministers of holy almes, man out of the pretended care of peace & unity being caught in the snare of his impious boldnesse to correct the will of Christ, brought forth to himselfe upon the Church that irreconcileable schisme of perdition and Apostasy, the Roman Antichrist: for that the exaltation of the Pope arose out of the reason of Prelaty it cannot be deny'd. And as I noted before that the patterne of the High Priest pleaded for in the Gospel (for take away the head Priest the rest are but a carcasse) sets up with better reason a Pope, then an Archbishop, for if Prelaty must still rise and rise till it come to a Primat, why should it stay there? when as the catholick government is not to follow the division of kingdomes, the temple best representing the universall Church, and the High Priest the universall head; so I observe here, that if to quiet schisme there must be one head of Prelaty in a land or Monarchy rising from a Provinciall to a nationall Primacy, there may upon better grounds of repressing schisme be set up one catholick head over the catholick Church. For the peace and good of the Church is not terminated in the schismelesse estate of one or two kingdomes, but should be provided for by the joynt consultation of all reformed Christendome: that all controversie may end in the finall pronounce or canon of one Arch-primat, or Protestant Pope. Although by this meanes for ought I see, all the diameters of schisme may as well meet and be knit up in the center of one grand falshood. Now let all impartiall men arbitrate what goodly inference these two maine reasons of the Prelats have, that by a naturall league of consequence make more for the Pope then for themselves. Yea to say more home are the very wombe for a new subantichrist to breed in; if it be not rather the old force and power of the same man of sin counterfeiting protestant. It was not the prevention of schisme, but it was schisme it selfe, and the hatefull thirst of Lording in the Church that first bestow'd a being upon Prelaty; this was the true cause, but the pretence is stil the same. The Prelates, as they would have it thought, are the only mawls of schisme. Forsooth if they be put downe, a deluge of innumerable sects will follow; we shall be all Brownists, Familists, Anabaptists. For the word Puritan seemes to be quasht, and all that heretofore were counted such, are now Brownists. And thus doe they raise an evill report upon the expected reforming grace that God hath bid us hope for, like those faithlesse spies, whose carcasses shall perish in the wildernesse of their owne confused ignorance, and never taste the good of reformation. doe they keep away schisme? if to bring a num and chil stupidity of soul, an unactive blindnesse of minde upon the people by their leaden doctrine, or no doctrine at all, if to persecute all knowing and zealous Christians by the violence of their courts, be to keep away schisme, they keep away schisme indeed; and by this kind of discipline all Italy and Spaine is as purely and politickly kept from schisme as England hath beene by them. With as good a plea might the dead palsie boast to a man, tis I that free you from stitches and paines, and the troublesome feeling of cold & heat, of wounds and stroke; if I were gone, all these would molest you. The Winter might as well vaunt it selfe against the Spring, I destroy all noysome and rank weeds, I keepe downe all pestilent vapours. Yes and all wholesome herbs, and all fresh dews, by your violent & hidebound frost; but when the gentle west winds shall open the fruitfull bosome of the earth thus over-girded by your imprisonment, then the flowers put forth and spring, and then the Sunne shall scatter the mists, and the manuring hand of the Tiller shall root up all that burdens the soile without thank to your bondage. But farre worse then any frozen captivity is the bondage of Prelates, for that other, if it keep down any thing which is good, within the earth, so doth it likewise that which is ill, but these let out freely the ill, and keep down the good, or else keepe downe the lesser ill, and let out the greatest. Be asham'd at last to tell the Parlament ye curbe Schismaticks, when as they know ye cherish and side with Papists, and are now as it were one party with them, and tis said they helpe to petition for ye. Can we believe that your government strains in good earnest at the petty gnats of schisme, when as we see it makes nothing to swallow the Camel heresie of Rome; but that indeed your throats are of the right Pharisaical straine. Where are those schismaticks with whom the Prelats hold such hot skirmish? shew us your acts, those glorious annals which your Courts of loathed memory lately deceas'd have left us? those schismaticks I doubt me wil be found the most of them such as whose only schisme was to have spoke the truth against your high abominations and cruelties in the Church; this is the schisme ye hate most, the removall of your criminous Hierarchy. A politick government of yours, and of a pleasant conceit, set up to remove those as a pretended schisme, that would remove you as a palpable heresie in government. If the schisme would pardon ye that, she might go jagg'd in as many cuts and slashes as she pleas'd for you. As for the rending of the Church, we have many reasons to thinke it is not that which ye labour to prevent so much as the rending of your pontificall sleeves: that schisme would be the sorest schisme to you, that would be Brownisme and Anabaptisme indeed. If we go downe, say you, as if Adrians wall were broke, a flood of sects will rush in. What sects? What are their opinions? give us the Inventory; it will appeare both by your former prosecutions and your present instances, that they are only such to speake of as are offended with your lawlesse government, your ceremonies, your Liturgy, an extract of the Masse book translated. But that they should be contemners of publick prayer, and Churches us'd without superstition, I trust God will manifest it ere long to be as false a slander, as your former slanders against the Scots. Noise it till ye be hoarse; that a rabble of Sects will come in, it will be answer'd ye, no rabble sir Priest, but a unanimous multitude of good Protestants will then joyne to the Church, which now because of you stand separated. This will be the dreadfull consequence of your removall. As for those terrible names of Sectaries and Schismaticks which ye have got together, we know your manner of fight, when the quiver of your arguments which is ever thin, and weakly stor'd, after the first brunt is quite empty, your course is to betake ye to your other quiver of slander, wherein lyes your best archery. And whom ye could not move by sophisticall arguing, them you thinke to confute by scandalous misnaming. Thereby inciting the blinder sort of people to mislike and deride sound doctrine and good christianity under two or three vile and hatefull terms. But if we could easily indure and dissolve your doubtiest reasons in argument, we shall more easily beare the worst of your unreasonablenesse in calumny and false report. Especially being fortold by Christ, that if he our Master were by your predecessors call'd Samaritan and Belzebub, we must not think it strange if his best Disciples in the reformation, as at first by those of your tribe they were call'd Lollards and Hussites, so now by you be term'd Puritans, and Brownists. But my hope is that the people of England will not suffer themselves to be juggl'd thus out of their faith and religion by a mist of names cast before their eyes, but will search wisely by the Scriptures, and look quite through this fraudulent aspersion of a disgracefull name into the things themselves: knowing that the Primitive Christians in their times were accounted such as are now call'd Familists and Adamites, or worse. And many on the Prelatickside like the Church of Sardis have a name to live, and yet are dead; to be Protestants, and are indeed Papists in most of their principles. Thus perswaded, this your old fallacy wee shall soone unmask, and quickly apprehend how you prevent schisme, and who are your schismaticks. But what if ye prevent, and hinder all good means of preventing schisme? that way which the Apostles us'd, was to call a councell; from which by any thing that can be learnt from the fifteenth of the Acts, no faithfull Christian was debarr'd, to whom knowledge and piety might give entrance. Of such a councell as this every parochiall Consistory is a right homogeneous and constituting part being in it selfe as it were a little Synod, and towards a generall assembly moving upon her own basis in an even and firme progression, as those smaller squares in battell unite in one great cube, the main phalanx, an embleme of truth and stedfastnesse. Whereas on the other side Prelaty ascending by a graduall monarchy from Bishop to Arch-bishop, from thence to Primat, and from thence, for there can be no reason yeilded neither in nature, nor in religion, wherefore, if it have lawfully mounted thus high, it should not be a Lordly ascendent in the horoscope of the Church, from Primate to Patriarch, and so to Pope. I say Prelaty thus ascending in a continuall pyramid upon pretence to perfect the Churches unity, if notwithstanding it be found most needfull, yea the utmost helpe to dearn up the rents of schisme by calling a councell, what does it but teach us that Prelaty is of no force to effect this work which she boasts to be her maister-peice; and that her pyramid aspires and sharpens to ambition, not to perfection, or unity. This we know, that as often as any great schisme disparts the Church, and Synonds be proclam'd, the Presbyters have as great right there, and as free vote of old, as the Bishops, which the Canon law conceals not. So that Prelaty if she will seek to close up divisions in the Church, must be forc't to dissolve, and unmake her own pyramidal figure, which she affirmes to be of such uniting power, when as indeed it is the most dividing and schismaticall forme that Geometricians know of, and must be faine to inglobe, or incube her selfe among the Presbyters; which she hating to do, sends her haughty Prelates from all parts with their forked Miters, the badge of schisme or the stampe of his cloven foot whom they serve I think, who according to their hierarchies acuminating still higher and higher in a cone of Prelaty, in stead of healing up the gashes of the Church, as it happens in such pointed bodies meeting, fall to gore one another with their sharpe spires for upper place, and precedence, till the councell it selfe prove the greatest schisme of all. And thus they are so farre from hindring dissension, that they have made unprofitable, and even noysome the chiefest remedy we have to keep Christendom at one, which is by councels: and these if wee rightly consider Apostolick example, are nothing else but generall Presbyteries. This seem'd so farre from the Apostles to think much of, as if hereby their dignity were impair'd, that, as we may gather by those Epistles of Peter and Iohn, which are likely to be latest written when the Church grew to a setling, like those heroick patricians of Rome (if we may use such comparison) hasting to lay downe their dictatorship, they rejoys't to call themselves and to be as fellow Elders among their brethren. Knowing that their high office was but as the scaffolding of the Church yet unbuilt, and would be but a troublesome disfigurement, so soone as the building was finisht. But the lofty minds of an age or two after, such was their small discerning, thought it a poore indignity, that the high rear'd government of the Church should so on a sudden, as it seem'd to them, squat into a Presbytery. Next or rather before councels the timeliest prevention of schisme is to preach the Gospell abundantly and powerfully throughout all the land, to instruct the youth religiously, to endeavour how the Scriptures may be easiest understood by all men; to all which the proceedings of these men have been on set purpose contrary. But how O Prelats should you remove schisme, and how should you not remove and oppose all the meanes of removing schism? when Prelaty is a schisme it selfe from the most reformed and most flourishing of our neighbour Churches abroad, and a sad subject of discord and offence to the whole nation at home. The remedy which you alledge is the very disease we groan under; and never can be to us a remedy but by removing it selfe. Your predecessors were believ'd to assume this preeminence above their brethren only that they might appease dissention. Now God and the Church cals upon you, for the same reason to lay it down, as being to thousands of good men offensive, burdensome, intolerable. Surrender that pledge which unlesse you fowlely usurpt it, the Church gave you, and now claimes it againe, for the reason she first lent it. Discharge the trust committed to you, prevent schisme, and that ye can never do, but by discharging your selves. That government which ye hold, we confesse prevents much, hinders much, removes much; but what? the schisms and grievances of the Church? no, but all the peace and unity, all the welfare not of the Church alone, but of the whole kingdome. And if it be still permitted ye to hold, will cause the most sad I know not whether separation be enough to say, but such a wide gulph of distraction in this land as will never close her dismall gap, untill ye be forc't (for of your selvs ye wil never do as that Roman Curtius nobly did) for the Churches peace & your countries, to leap into the midst, and be no more seen. By this we shal know whether yours be that ancient Prelaty which you say was first constituted for the reducement of quiet & unanimity into the Church, for then you wil not delay to prefer that above your own preferment. If otherwise, we must be confident that your Prelaty is nothing else but your ambition, an insolent preferring of your selves above your brethren, and all your learned scraping in antiquity even to disturbe the bones of old Aaron and his sonnes in their graves, is but to maintain and set upon our necks a stately and severe dignity, which you call sacred, and is nothing in very deed but a grave and reverent gluttony, a sanctimonious avarice, in comparison of which, all the duties and dearnesses which ye owe to God or to his Church, to law, custome, or nature, ye have resolv'd to set at nought. I could put you in mind what counsell Clement a fellow labourer with the Apostles gave to the Presbyters of Corinth, whom the people though unjustly sought to remove. Who among you saith he, is noble minded, who is pittifull, who is charitable, let him say thus, if for me this sedition, this enmity, these differences be, I willingly depart, I go my wayes, only let the flock of Christ be at peace with the Presbyters that are set over it. He that shall do this, saith he, shall get him great honour in the Lord, and all places will receave him. This was Clements counsell to good and holy men that they should depart rather from their just office, then by their stay, to ravle out the seamlesse garment of concord in the Church. But I have better counsell to give the Prelats, and farre more acceptable to their eares, this advice in my opinion is fitter for them. Cling fast to your Pontificall Sees, bate not, quit your selves like Barons, stand to the utmost for your haughty Courts and votes in Parliament. Still tell us that you prevent schisme, though schisme and combustion be the very issue of your bodies, your first born; and set your country a bleeding in a Prelaticall mutiny, to fight for your pompe, and that ill favour'd weed of temporall honour that sits dishonourably upon your laick shoulders, that ye may be fat and fleshy, swoln with high thoughts and big with mischievous designes, when God comes to visit upon you all this forescore yeares vexation of his Church under your Egyptian tyranny. For certainly of all those blessed soules which you have persecuted, and those miserable ones which you have lost, the just vengeance does not sleepe.

CHAP. VII.

That those many Sects and schismes by some suppos'd to be among us, and that rebellion in Ireland, ought not to be a hindrance, but a hastning of reformation.

As for those many Sects and divisions rumor'd abroad to be amongst us, it is not hard to perceave that they are partly the meere fictions and false alarmes of the Prelates, thereby to cast amazements and panick terrors into the hearts of weaker Christians that they should not venture to change the present deformity of the Church for fear of I know not what worse inconveniencies. With the same objected feares and suspicions, we know that suttle Prelat Gardner sought to divert the first reformation. It may suffice us to be taught by S. Paul that there must be sects for the manifesting of those that are sound hearted. These are but winds and flaws to try the floting vessell of our faith whether it be stanch and sayl well, whether our ballast be just, our anchorage and cable strong. By this is seene who lives by faith and certain knowledge, and who by credulity and the prevailing opinion of the age; whose vertue is of an unchangeable graine, and whose of a slight wash. If God come to trie our constancy we ought not to shrink, or stand the lesse firmly for that, but passe on with more stedfast resolution to establish the truth though it were through a lane of sects and heresies on each side. Other things men do to the glory of God: but sects and errors it seems God suffers to be for the glory of good men, that the world may know and reverence their true fortitude and undaunted constancy in the truth. Let us not therefore make these things an incumbrance, or an excuse of our delay in reforming, which God sends us as an incitement to proceed with more honour and alacrity. For if there were no opposition where were the triall of an unfained goodnesse and magnanimity? vertue that wavers is not vertue, but vice revolted from it selfe, and after a while returning. The actions of just and pious men do not darken in their middle course; but Solomon tels us they are as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfet day. But if we shall suffer the trifling doubts and jealousies of future sects to overcloud the faire beginnings of purpos'st reformation, let us rather fear that another proverb of the same Wiseman be not upraided to us, that the way of the wicked is as darknesse, they stumble at they know not what. If sects and schismes be turbulent in the unsetl'd estate of a Church, while it lies under the amending hand, it best beseems our Christian courage to think they are but as the throws and pangs that go before the birth of reformation, and that the work it selfe is now in doing. For if we look but in the nature of elementall and mixt things, we know they cannot suffer any change of one kind, or quality into another without the struggl of contrarieties. And in things artificiall, seldome any elegance is wrought without a superfluous wast and refuse in the transaction. No Marble statue can be politely carv'd, no fair edifice built without almost as much rubbish and sweeping. Insomuch that even in the spirituall conflict of S. Pauls conversion there fell scales from his eyes that were not perceav'd before. No wonder then in the reforming of a Church which is never brought to effect without the fierce encounter of truth and falshood together, if, as it were the splinters and shares of so violent a jousting, there fall from between the shock many fond errors and fanatick opinions, which when truth has the upper hand, and the reformation shall be perfeted, will easily be rid out of the way, or kept so low, as that they shall be only the exercise of our knowledge, not the disturbance, or interruption of our faith. As for that which Barclay >in his image of minds writes concerning the horrible and barbarous conceits of Englishmen in their religion. I deeme it spoken like what hee was, a fugitive Papist traducing the Iland whence he sprung. It may be more judiciously gather'd from hence, that the Englishman of many other nations is least atheisticall, and bears a naturall disposition of much reverence and awe towards the Deity; but in his weaknesse and want of better instruction, which among us too frequently is neglected, especially by the meaner sort, turning the bent of his own wits with a scrupulous and ceaselesse care what he might do to informe himselfe aright of God and his worship, he may fall not unlikely sometimes as any otherland man into an uncouth opinion. And verily if we look at his native towardlinesse in the roughcast without breeding, some nation or other may haply be better compos'd to a naturall civility, and right judgement then he. But if he get the benefit once of a wise and well rectifi'd nurture, which must first come in generall from the godly vigilance of the Church, I suppose that where ever mention is made of countries manners, or men, the English people among the first that shall be prais'd, may deserve to be accounted a right pious, right honest, and right hardy nation. But thus while some stand dallying and deferring to reform for fear of that which should mainly hasten them forward, lest schism and error should encrease, we may now thank our selves and our delayes if instead of schism a bloody and inhumane rebellion be strook in between our slow movings. Indeed against violent and powerfull opposition there can be no just blame of a lingring dispatch. But this I urge against those that discourse it for a maxim, as if the swift opportunities of establishing, or reforming religion, were to attend upon the fleam of state businesse. In state many things at first are crude and hard to digest, which only time and deliberation can supple, and concoct. But in religion wherein is no immaturity, nothing out of season, it goes farre otherwise. The doore of grace turnes upon smooth hinges wide opening to send out, but soon shutting to recall the precious offers of mercy to a nation: which unlesse Watchfulnesse and Zeale two quick-sighted and ready-handed Virgins be there in our behalfe to receave, we loose: and still the ofter we loose, the straiter the doore opens, and the lesse is offer'd. This is all we get by demurring in Gods service. Tis not rebellion that ought to be the hindrance of reformation, but it is the want of this which is the cause of that. The Prelats which boast themselves the only bridlers of schisme God knows have been so cold and backward both there and with us to represse heresie and idolatry, that either through their carelessenesse or their craft all this mischiefe is befaln. What can the Irish subject do lesse in Gods just displeasure against us, then revenge upon English bodies the little care that our Prelats have had of their souls. Nor hath their negligence been new in that Iland but ever notorious in Queen Elizabeths dayes, as Camden their known friend forbears not to complain. Yet so little are they toucht with remorce of these their cruelties, for these cruelties are theirs, the bloody revenge of those souls which they have famisht, that whenas against our brethren the Scots, who by their upright and loyall deeds have now bought themselves an honourable name to posterity, whatsoever malice by slander could invent, rage in hostility attempt, they greedily attempted, toward these murdrous Irish the enemies of God and mankind, a cursed off-spring of their own connivence, no man takes notice but that they seeme to be very calmely and indifferently affected. Where then should we begin to extinguish a rebellion that hath his cause from the mis-government of the Church, where? but at the Churches reformation, and the removall of that government which persues and warres with all good Christians under the name of schismaticks, but maintains and fosters all Papists and Idolaters as tolerable Christians. And if the sacred Bible may be our light, we are neither without example, nor the witnesse of God himselfe, that the corrupted estate of the Church is both the cause of tumult, and civill warres, and that to stint them, the peace of the Church must first be setl'd. Now for a long season, saith Azariah to King Asa, Israel hath beene without the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without law: and in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries. And nation was destroy'd of nation, and City of City, for God did vex them with all adversity. Be ye strong therefore, saith he to the reformers of that age, and let not your hands be weake, for your worke shall bee rewarded. And in those Prophets that liv'd in the times of reformation after the Captivity often doth God stirre up the people to consider that while establishment of Church matters was neglected, and put off, there was no peace to him that went out or came in, for I, saith God, had set all men every one against his neighbour. But from the very day forward that they went seriously, and effectually about the welfare of the Church, he tels them that they themselves might perceave the sudden change of things into a prosperous and peacefull condition. But it will here be said that the reformation is a long work, and the miseries of Ireland are urgent of a speedy redresse. They be indeed; and how speedy we are, the poore afflicted remnant of our martyr'd countrymen that sit there on the Sea-shore, counting the houres of our delay with their sighs, and the minuts with their falling teares, perhaps with the destilling of their bloody wounds, if they have not quite by this time cast off, and almost curst the vain hope of our founder'd ships, and aids, can best judge how speedy we are to their reliefe. But let their succors be hasted, as all need and reason is, and let not therefore the reformation which is the chiefest cause of successe and victory be still procrastinated. They of the captivity in their greatest extremities could find both counsell and hands anough at once to build, and to expect the enemies assault. And we for our parts a populous and mighty nation must needs be faln into a strange plight either of effeminacy, or confusion, if Ireland that was once the conquest of one single Earle with his privat forces, and the small assistance of a petty Kernish Prince, should not take up all the wisdome and prowesse of this potent Monarchy to quell a barbarous crew of rebels, whom if we take but the right course to subdue, that is beginning at the reformation of our Church, their own horrid murders and rapes will so fight against them, that the very sutlers and horse boyes of the Campe will be able to rout and chase them without the staining of any Noble sword. To proceed by other method in this enterprize, be our Captains and Commanders never so expert, will be as great an error in the art of warre, as any novice in souldiership ever committed. And thus I leave it as a declared truth, that neither the feare of sects no nor rebellion can be a fit plea to stay reformation, but rather to push it forward with all possible diligence and speed.",John Milton,1998,"[99, 90, 80, 85, 86, 78, 76, 71, 67, 67, 69, 71]",12

Two personalities check the posture
Smoke out the mouth clear out the nostrils
Think of death, the life seem scary
I'm passin' graveyards seein' people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin til' I'm out parachutin'
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds
Twenty five thousand a piece, fuck streets
Tryin' to own the island, forget about wylin'
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'
If I showed you where I lived you would think I was hidin'
Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English
Wake up in Trinidad like fuck it I'm rich
Come back, private jet
Live on set, if you can shit gold, I can spit baguettes

[Chorus: Lil Kim]
It's the key to life

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo nothin' but the hotness whenever we drop this
Monotonous for ya'll to keep hatin' cause ya'll never gon' stop us
I keep my rocks spotless and my hoes topless
Take time try to figure out who The Lox is
Fear no one kick rhymes like Shoguns
You scared to blow one, get robbed wit' your own gun
If I don't respect you I'ma check you
And if I don't kiss you I'mma peck you
Right before I wet you I sneeze on tracks an' bless you
I'm special and if you like workin' out
Then I'm gon' stretch you
Husslin' is dead but we still get red
Turn the spots into bakeries to get back bread
And ya'll said my money's spent but it's in the Bent'
So when the Feds come, the dogs can't get a scent
For my story, self-explanatory
That I'm the hottest thing on the street
And yall ain't got nothin' for me

[Chorus: Lil Kim]
It's the key to life
Money, power, and respect, whatchu' need in life

Wet em' up and watch em' come get em' up

Bitch, I'll make your shit hurt, step back like 'I did work'

What'chu think I'm playin', till you layin'
In the car in the junkyard decayin'
Mom's at home prayin' that you comin' home
But you not, cause you sittin' up in the trunk
Startin' to rot

250,Raise The Roof,"Testing - one - two
Testing - one - two
The house is now on fire
Spread the walls ya'll
Everybody get somebody we don't want anybody let fuck nobody
Cause you know what time it is
It's time to get busy
And when it's time to get busy
You know what you gotta do

[Verse 1]
Raise the roof because it's all on fire
Not done by the sun or electrical wire
Not done by sons striking matches with daughters
But done by scratches so save that water
This jam is packed so I just figure
All we need is the house to get bigger
So startin' with the roof down to the base
We're at your service to burn the place

Come on
Come on
Come on Raise the roof
That's right
Raise the roof
Come on

[Verse 2]
With the spot as hot as it can get
And the roof's on fire, you're soakin' wet
The puzzle on your face shows as you sweat
But your body keeps movin' with no regret
Chandeliers shake, swing from front to back
Left to right all night, and the lights don't crack
Your mind's on the time, hopin' it don't end
'Cause it's time to get stupid, here we go again

Come on
Come on
Come on Raise the roof
That's right
Raise the roof
Come on

[Verse 3]
Stare at the strobe, pull your earlobe
For the sights and sounds clear across the globe
This jam might hit or miss the charts
But the style gets wild as state of the art
Dazzling in science, bold in nerve
But givin' my house what it deserves
Served on the floor 'cause I got paid
Make the fans that left, wished they had'a stayed
Realize my friend, ain't this a trip
As your body gets railed when you do the flip
And your mind gets rocked when we're on the roll
Then the freak of the week makes you lose control
A Swatch for a watch, so you'll know the time
Your crowd gets loud and you clock my rhyme
The messiah's on fire and I'm living proof
I'll quench your desire and raise your roof

Come on
Come on
Come on Raise the roof
That's right
Raise the roof
Come on

[Verse 4]
In school I'm cool throughout the week
When the weekend comes, I'm down with the Greeks
Frat brothers known across the seven seas
Fly ladies of the 80's, sororities
The Zetas, Deltas, the AKA's
Women that keep me in a daze
The A Phi A, Sigma boys on the move
With the Kappas and the Ques and of course the Grooves
And for real it's the deal and the actual fact
It takes a nation of millions to hold me back
Rejected and accepted as a communist
Claimin' fame to my name as a terrorist
Makin' money in corners that you'll never see
Dodgin' judges and the lawyers and the third degree
Nothin' wrong with a song to make the strong survive
Realize gave me five cause I kept 'em alive
Mislead what you read about my devilish deeds
Mislead what I said so you're better off dead
Make 'em hear it and see it for the deaf and blind
And command it and we'll plan it for incapable minds
Take for granted and demand it from the wave of my hand
Make the jealous understand it and just say damn
When they see me ask a question, ""How can it be?""
When they watch me pull a serpent straight from out of the sea
Turn the winter into summer, then from hot to cold
Expand my power on the hour, make you all behold
From the slammer swing a hammer like the mighty Thor
God of thunder, you'll go under, then you'll all applaud
And fathom that distance, the mad must reap
Meet Namor sea lord, Prince of the deep
Here for you to fear at any cost
Tellin' you to get busy or you better get lost
Livin' lives civilized from the lessons I taught
Cities buried underground just because I went off
My friends, enemies, better be my friend
Is question people guessin' is this the end?
End of the world, are you guessin' yes?
Just say don't delay it, get it off your chest
Houses of crack, I've seen too much
I go ready, aim, fire, then I'll blow 'em up",Public Enemy,1998,"[64, 54, 50, 44, 40, 39, 37, 32, 28, 26, 26, 30, 30, 30, 35, 42, 49, 51, 52, 59]",20

Swimming with a memory that he can't drown

And he's holding on to a fragile old hand

We capitalize and monopolize on everything we see keep pistols drawed
And cocked, we got the industry locked, we can't be stopped, too hot
Check the spots that we got, on Billboard
This Tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes
Want some mo? Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mamma Mia
The Unlady Like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away
So stay in yo' place, when ya hear mamma speakin
Cannon spray, clear the way, when ya see The Tank creepin

I'm that nigga that rappers look up to when they won't know how to do it
Used to be the little bitty skinny motherfucker with the braids in his hair
Used to live on Tchoupitoulas
I done paid my dues, but still played the blues
Nigga play me like you was scared to lose
I'm still a fool, you ain't heard the news
I’m with them No Limit niggas, makin' major moves
I won't stop now, bitch, I can't stop
You can't stop me, so bitch don't try we
We TRU soldiers, we don't die

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back

Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

I know everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role, on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

[Chorus 2]
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
You can turn the track up a little bit for me
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
All up in my ears
Better now than never, business before pleasure
The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud

Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'

In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the Feds hate me
The son of (*Satan*), they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin', your fam' destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone - Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Cristal keep spillin' shit; you overdid it holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin' like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, we just macin' them, placin' them
In fune-rals, criminals turned aroused
To Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman
Y'all just betray men, we spray men, I position competition

But what lasts longer than that? The actual

[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Game supernatural, Ouija
The kid too clean, squeaky
Windshield squeegee, see me?
Y'all think it's joke, joke, hehe
But it's inevitable, like, dagger in a bro pee-pee
Spoke freely to see how the folks feel me
I don't even know the real me
So what makes you think you know the deal, b, feel me?
I'm not really concerned with the concerns
Of the people who can't even discern my concerns
I turn my concerns into words I could earn a couple curds and whey with
Told I got a way with words, but it doesn't take much, I just say shit
Half my ancestors was stuck on a slave ship
The plan was, rob every label with the same clip
I know it sounds basic to some
But what's basic to some, to some others is actual
Peep the factual, professional sabbatical taker
I'm a Laker, a cake-baker, a money-maker
A funny-joker, a dummy-smoker
A global village idiot, killin' it
Tell me if you feelin' it

Yo, think about your momma
Think about the drama
Think about the llamas
Think about the commas

They fiend, forever wean from a bag that's plasticine
And pass the green and stack the cream

Cash rule everything around everyone
Plenty guns, anyone could become anyone

Yo, abra kadabra magical, respect, unilateral
Universal magnetic, automatically attractin' you
These rapper dudes, mad are emotional or irrational
Use it motivation, they convergin' on the capital
International travel, unfurl and unravel my flag
I put it down year-round, check the calendar
The places I've never been I'm tryin' to get to
God the pilot, I'm the passenger
Whip it through the African diaspora
Followin' navigation like nations to a degree
Like a doctor or when I'm rockin', the education is key
Swallowin' medications like patients to a degree
Like a doctor give remedies, except the doctor is me
Uppers and downers help us to cope with the stuff around us
To drown us and get to livin' from over and under counters

Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club

With the motherfucking top down, I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre you passed me the torch
I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion ‘till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down

Tell 'em you came with me (We gonna twist up)

This is revenge for all the dead children
That fell victim from way back
This here is for every single Arab
Shit, even the Christians are gonna feel like they're getting their payback, once I rape your mother in the ass with no protection, bare back, wearing a Mel Gibson face mask
You know what rhymes with bar mitzvah? Swastika
Let's see where you're at, Iron
Let's see if Solomon can handle this
Today I'ma put you through some body building championships
You gon' get pushed to your max, Iron
Straighten out your act here
‘Cause any hot-headed shit will get you laid out flat, Iron
Today I'ma run laps around him
'Til he get exhausted and I tire Iron like he had a flat tire
‘Cause he never had drive
He just stood on the side and watched me pass by him
He's passed his prime, so ain't no use for him coming back fightin'
The last time anyone gave a fuck about Iron's mic
Is when we had Tyson, so if Iron make a comeback for one last time he gon' get smashed like him
You've been pussy since Grizzle Mania, duckin' and divin'
Always playing about being safe and survivin'
I know you vanished away, and take cover, so it ain't no surprisin'
That once he takes cover ain't no way I'ma find him
‘Cause Annie Frank used to guide him
So I know she told you all the perfect places to hide in
Yeah, Anne Frank… What a damn skank!
Someone, pass me my gas tank!
I am Hitler, the real Heinrich Himmler
Sieg heil to your wife and sister
You've been on two lists your whole life… mine and Schindler's
I asked you to battle me, the first time you said ""no""
The second time you said ""no""
If you would've flaked this time
It would've been your third Reich in a row
I said, I thought you would flake
I'm honestly shocked you would take me
Had me feeling like Pesci all day
I started sweating thinking he didn't have the balls to face me
But now that we here, Iron, I know who your father is
You grew up off of Little Mermaid royalties
Since we were in third grade; you was always rich
The reason you fell off is this
It's the work ethic, you never have to work hard for shit
You never starved for shit
Anything you asked Daddy for you would always get
See, you that fat guy that walked into the gym
Got on a treadmill and jogged a bit, but you never stayed on it for long enough to even break no body sweat
So now you're stuck in the same plateau
You haven't evolved from since, but use your common sense
You've been living off a false sense of accomplishment
‘Cause if you worked hard like all us did
You would've not have quit, you probably'd thought a bit
And realized, ""Nah, I worked too hard for this
I'm Iron Solomon, I'll go back and demolish 'em!""
Where's your gladiator armor kit? Your heart of Spartacus?
Your ""I am Sparta"" shit? C'mon, dawg, you got this shit!
I'm giving you back all your confidence
You soaking all this in, you know, I normally charge for this
I'm just saying, you was a legend to all of us
But when you're in the room your energy isn't really felt
Try to yell your bars to us
Your vocal projection just never hits hard enough
Like uhh… [*snaps fingers*] like a Math Hoffa punch
But aren't you Jewish? Aren't you Jewish?
You celebrated so many Hanukkah's that by now you supposed to have way more presence than all of us
We used to call you a pioneer. You went from that to letting your bitch re-write your third round for Daylyt
Wait a minute, you let your broad re-write all your hard work and tears? You take advice from someone else?
Wait, y'all don't think that's weird?
Honestly you can call it how you want to call it
But to me all this shit is clear
Iron Man could never get the job done
Without someone like Jarvis talking in his ear
Makes sense you're Tony Starks though
‘Cause every time you get picked apart in a battle
It's back to the lab to have your bitch walk around
Holding up the pad, helping you charge up for a year
That's why Tony Stark is never as solid as he appears
You've always been in constant fear
The Iron suit is just an outer part
The center piece is hollow up in here
Iron Man has had an artificial heart from the start of his career
Now look where your life's at, nigga!
See, you were fine 'til you tried Smack, but you can't deny facts
That if Iron himself had the type of endurance, then he might last
But he left too much of a wide gap
Where he didn't focus on his rhyme craft
So if you paid more attention in science class, you would know that iron becomes rusty when you let too much time pass
These bars I drop got knowledge in 'em, Darwinism
Charles Dickens versus non-fiction DNA mama level autism
Plus, your father scripted all of Oscar The Grouch's shit for Sesame Street, so now I know where you inherit all your garbage writtens
Yeah, you fell off, you gotta admit it
You should've moved to New Orleans and got an apartment to live in with a bunch of tsunami victims, so you can share stories all day about how you're washed up with them
This is God gifted, I'm God-gifted
Watching me spit is like a game of Twister
‘Cause I can catch bodies back to back with my skills on the spot
And that's the reason you got us all twisted
I mean, you the best freestyler? Explain how
Yo, back in the day, if you didn't recycle so much
You wouldn't even have a name now
And I'm gonna explain how, you know the, ""You're behind on California time"" you told The Saurus?
That was the second time you recycled those same rounds
Let's play a game of I Swear Now
Say, ""I swear on my newborn child I didn't use those lines in a battle with Okwerdz that never came out.""
Look at his face now!
You look like you just got caught in a stupid lie
You have a better chance of getting Sacha Cohen
To show up here dressed up as Borat in a suit and tie
‘Cause that's the only way this crowd gonna get to see another Arab get played by a Jewish guy
I'm tryin' to get y'all to see
That he's the fakest freestyler that's on the scene
But y'all don't see it, y'all just obsessed with these little pussies
Like a bunch of Carter Deems
He's a dead man walkin', he's almost in his coffin
He's just caught in between
He got one window to get outside of this box he's in
I got him inside of a laundry machine
And that's the irony in it, ‘cause even if Iron makes it out of it clean
All it means is me and Iron still got to iron out some things
We gon' get right down to the T
Even if you don't like how it seems
If he won't tell me what his true religion is, fuck it
I'ma find out when he gets [*punched*] right out of his jeans
How was that for an ironing theme?
Well, I got a different type of iron scheme
I'll take an iron fist to Iron's cheek like an Iron Sheik
And you wouldn't dare fight me inside the ring
I wish he would try me, even if I tried him he wouldn't try a thing
Even if Iron was Tiger Woods you wouldn't see Iron swing
But you'll probably rap about Math for three rounds
If you do, then be prepared to throw hands with me now
If you did, it would be like the Shazam app
‘Cause you would quickly catch a beat down
I don't give a fuck if you think I'm emotional, bitch
If you acting tough like Andy Gump
We can go outside and box over this shit
I'm about to hit him with the fucking closer, ‘cause I don't care
Kill yourself, ‘cause even if you did people probably still won't care
Take your Spring Fever CD
Walk to a black hole, get lost in the middle of nowhere
And don't forget to take Adam Sandler
And all his gay-ass movies with you when you go there! Faggot!

[Round 1: Iron Solomon]
Oh… Fuck. I made my own bed
When I was dormant, I gave y'all a reason to snooze on me
Tonight we putting that to rest
Y'all still sleeping, then you zombies
What you'll see is a true homi
That looks like lipo to you prob'ly
‘Cause he's gonna suck and I'ma get a new body
This throne is my home, I came back for the upkeep
With retard strength, all your battles are dumb weak
This quack will be duck meat for flappin' too much beak
I'm doing my numbers on the web: duck feet
If you fucked The Saurus's mother forty some weeks
Before The Saurus was born you couldn't compete
If you wouldn't come East, I'd come confront him in the West
I'd throw hands across America, every fucking punch connects
You a one and done at best, I'm the one who done it best
Big killers sleep in a guillotine, a cut above the rest
I'm the recoil that'll leave your gun hand crushed
True artist, I paint pictures with a drum and brush
I'm the one man band that Questlove can't touch
Serve food for thought like The Roots front man's lunch
Do You Want More?!!!??! Do you want more?
Your half life starts once Organik flips the coin
‘Cause that's when things fall apart
And this is just the tipping point for now, brother
I'ma milk this, my style butter
The crowd love me like a cow's utter in Calcutta
The savior, the Christians prayin' to Jesus
To Jews I am Moses, to Pagans I'm they Zeus
Walk the crowd like the holy ghost, strolling through the convent
You can smell Jehovah's odor on me: I am godsent
You will never see me lose to this old Lebaneser Scrooge
They booked a death machine for you
I suggest you think it through
You'll get digested, eaten, chewed: you a recipe for food
Step inside the lion's den, you don't get to leave the zoo
A different pedigree than you, that's why I would like to question
What did you bring to the game?
What makes this guy some type of legend?
Working 20 years on his precise refined impression
Of Eminem’s exact style from 1997?
This Afghan a Stan, such a rabid fan
Your whole style is cut from someone else's cloth: you Dapper Dan
With a master plan to spit some multi-syllable shit
To distract the fans while you spit some old silly bullshit
Get out the kiddie pool, Diz, you supposed to be an adult
You keep getting old, but we don't seem to see the results
You're just a lost boy: Peter Pan
Whose punchlines never land
When D's in bad form he needs a hook to get a hand
I mean, for real, what's this guy's problem?
Tinkerbell is what I call him
He got dusted and did some fairy shit to keep the light on him
""I want views like Fetty Wap to get the blind to see
I only got to sock it to get to where I should be.""
Lash out and patch it up, nothing's cornier
What you've become gave battles a stigma, Diz
I'm disappointed at what my pupil's done
In hindsight, the Bay watches you hassle Hoffa for lime light
And this guy's hype off of that surprise fight
Like that's a prize fight
Even though we know you only go to blows if it's staged right
The irony, that these homophobe's fans support gay rights
Had your people ridin' the benches, jump right into trenches
You got some grimy intentions
When you're inside of these lenses
You see, to me, turning battles into fights is just senseless
But cross the line, this battle will bare a striking resemblance
I'm a wig splitter, I'm a ditch digger
I'm a shit kicker and I'm a bit bitter
You a quick pitcher, I'm a big swinger
Won't be the one running: I'm a pitch hitter
Fans of Diz figure I get disfigured… FUCK YOU! THIS FINGER!
If y'all keep it 100, then it'll be a 3-0: that's six figures
But since homie's a clown
I might throw my third round, ‘cause I want to sock ya
So if I beat this pussy ass 2-1, it's not a shocker
I will bow bow: Waka Flaka, better call a doctor
When I lick a shot in your noodle: penne alla vodka
When I'm done whuppin' your ass we gon' kick it at Brass Rail
There's a chick with a fat tail that be sendin' me fan mail
Them hoes aren't playin', see everybody knows our name
‘Cause I be tossing paper like I'm tryna expose Arcane

[Round 2: Dizaster]
Alright, so, you brought up the Math fight, of course
And I think it's awesome for you to reference
And I think it's really awesome for you to mention
No, honestly, bro, thanks for putting your two cents in
Are you sure it's not too expensive?
I know, for you being a Jew that's kind of a huge investment
You fucking chubby Chucky, southern country Humpty Dumpty-looking… Fucking ugly, musty, dusty, Rose Teletubby
Barney Rubble body double, Bubba Dudley cuddle buddy!
You fucking loser!
This guy is like Allen Iverson, he could've been the G.O.A.T
But he fucked up most of his chances, and that's the difference between the Kobe's and the Jordan's and Magic's
The ones that stayed in the game
And gave you more and more classics
And the ones that eventually fell off ‘cause they almost thought they were too good to show up to court for their practice
I know we appear like we're closely matched
But our roads don't overlap
When I kept on moving forward and passed
And you hit the fork in the road and went backwards
We both started off as the total package
And then you dipped into the lower bracket
Came back below the average of the normal standards
All it took was a little four-year absence
And you became a former has-been like Toni Braxton
You put in all this work to record these albums
That most fans in battle rap don't download no tracks from
The other half don't even notice you enough to even know you have one – this must be what it feels like to be La Toya Jackson
Plus, I got another question I been wantin' to ask him
Do you rap while you're doing home gymnastics?
Do you put your notepad down on your yoga mattress?
And you perform your dances like your multisyllabics
How you covert, you're graphic, so over-dramatic
Like an HBO crime scene show reenactment
Bro, you're a faggot!
Doctor's done fucked you up with a lot of medication, bro
And you got no more skill
Can't get back to his normal self
‘Cause he don't even know how normal feel
Quick, someone toss Jonah Hill another Soma pill
So he can focus still
‘Cause he's looking real shaky on film like Cloverfield
But anyways, how's that studio going though?
You recording still? Bro, you're ill
Still working toward that recording deal?
You'll make it… I know you will
‘Cause what you gon' do? Survive off your Fight Klub days?
Nobody even remembers those older rounds
The only thing we remember from Fight Club is
""Yo, hold it down!!! Hold it down!!!""
That's how annoying your fucking host would sound
Or who else remembers his battles from the Hall of Fame?
When you went off the top with a dude with his top off
Who remembers Iron Solomon versus Flamez?
Yeah, he got the W, right?
But him in that battle and the Holocaust were the same
‘Cause it wasn't no surprise to see a Jewish guy body in flames
Burn and you get burned in the game
Burn and I'll burn you with flames
Shit, even Bernie Sanders has the word ""burn"" in his name
Now you're in a dead zone where no one enters
""Pop pop"" goes the Heckler
Go against me, your physical form dismembered
You won't be able to use your legs or arms again
Like Denzel Washington when he starred in the Bone Collector
Your father built you an in house studio
To record your records and get your stuff done
But it's fucked up ‘cause you can't have black people come over
‘Cause ""Son, we don't trust them.""
It's all awkward ‘cause every time he has black folks recording over
And he comes into the room and confronts them
Like, ""Haah, soo, Young Gunz… where do you know my son from?""
All that matters when they view this back is who could rap
So where are all my goons from Fallujah at?
In the streets letting bazooka's and Ruger's clap
UZI's, MAC's with the new attachments
I got Halo from the future gats
Huger straps than the one's Duke Nukem has
Boom boom, shoot your ass, Hadouken flash
Boom boom, chalaka-boo your ass! I don't give a fuck!
Boom boom, North Korea nuclear blast
I'll reduce you to ash with a nuke, and nuke and ash
""What's that?"" – dude, that's Nash! You stupid ass!
Yo, my resume is like a fucking cemetery
Full of piles of human stacked
‘Cause I done caught more overseas bodies than the Cuban raft
If white boy got a 9, then he can get schooled with that
Get it? ‘Cause we're from two different schools
He a junior high school student, I'm a fully developed uni-grad
I'm too advanced for you to grasp
You Columbine poppin' 9's
I'm a Virginia Tech going off on students campus
Which means me and you are not in the same shooting class
Plus my newest strap got a built in Mac computer that
Keeps all of your vehicle movement's tracked like an Uber app
Can open up your location on Google Maps
See you in the window and zoom in fast
Shoot your ass through the glass
Spill your... ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​[*Diz fucks up here*]
I'm fucking up, I meant ""Spill your medulla on the Isuzu dash""
Then the people that are moving past
Will scream: ""Help! Someone just killed the fat kid from Superbad!""
And I don't give a fuck who you have
Bring your goons for backup
Then it's AngryFan movements: I'm only using caps
I'll put you and all your fruity-ass dogs together
In the same bag like a pack of Scooby Snacks
And if you come back from the dead...
I'ma put a giant round in the back of your head
Like one of your stupid-looking Jewish hats
I'll body everything in the room moving like I'm Supernat
Leave me alone before I blow a fuse and snap
Like a fuselage with a fuse attached
You'll get your fucking right socket removed and snatched
Get your eyeball turned into a wounded gash
And the next interview that you do with Vlad
You'll be on the couch telling stories with one of your pupils patched, Slick Rick The Ruler's back!
When I say ""Turn up!"", I mean turn up to the max…
I mean turn up to a vegetable
You seen that movie Expendables?
Well, I'll put you in a cast just as huge as that
Pussy! And you have pink eye!

[Round 2: Iron Solomon]
[*​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Iron Solomon clapping*]​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Good for you, Diz!
You got Pat Stay's formula down, and your formula down
I mean, you packed 60 seconds
With enough bars for a four-minute round
And you make it work, it's this crazy blur
Of rhyming schemes and hateful words
That you vomit out your mouth like you're tryna feed a baby bird
At some point you got a diss line for me or maybe Eurgh
A crowd reaction distracts him
He shouts ""FAGGOT!"" and a bunch of racial slurs
Just hoeing and yapping when he's supposed to be rapping
Acting like you got ovaries, and overreacting
So we can just guess what's next
From slug fest to gun threats, this chump went from throwing temper tantrums to throwing up sets
Choked out Billy, now he feel he's a roughneck
Been on 52 cards, got more attention from one deck
Looking like a junky that don't have any drugs left
You either need to catch up on rest or have a blood test
‘Cause the effects of crack and coke
Are what Dizaster don't consider
You got deeper into some yay shit than Amber Rose's fingers
So if you see this addict twitchin' like he can't control his temper
It's been half a minute since he had a chance to post on Twitter
I'm just tryin' to diagnose all of this clown's symptoms
Charron's autistic, but you've got ""I Want To Be Down""-syndrome
The type of lost nerd who wants to be hip hop so bad just to fit in
He got the Microsoft Word graffiti font tattooed on his skin
And what's under that mountain of ink
You need to talk about to a shrink
But there's a lot smarter people in this crowd than you think
We hear the contradictory shit out of your mouth when you speak
How you call Pat Stay a racist, then call Dumbfoundead a chink
Told Hoffa, ""Stop eating fried chicken!"", hardy har
That's as funny as the n-word with a hard -ER
So go on and recite all the bars you can write
About the Holocaust one night
Call me a ""kike"" and a bunch of shit I'm sure Caustic would like
(Thanks for the heroin, dawg!)
It's a strong strategy, Diz, say it with audacity!
Get loud! Talk rapidly! The crowd will all laugh at me
But if that exposes the bigots, then I'll take the fall happily
You think racism is hip hop? You're buying the wrong rap CD's
Under our skin we the same color
Don't believe it, then fight me!
Do it! You'll see you're just like me
When you get beat to the white meat
Maybe Iron Sol' versus Iron Sheik is what all of you wanted
Muhammad Ali versus Ali Muhammad
Well, that worked pretty well
I'ma make me some racist remarks now: your peoples eat pita
You were raised to be making these soft rounds
We ate matzah when we fled from Egypt, we went missin'
Where the heat of the desert
Where the stones were our best kitchen
And our food's hard texture is stemmed from that existence
What I'm saying is, going back generations we bred different
Our religious text gave us ambition your clan's missin'
2000 years before Muslims our Bible was handwritten
Y'all changed Abraham to Ibrahim and ran with that transcription
The Torah is the O.G., the Quran is just fan fiction
Boy, you done picked a bad Jew to attack
You know how many MC's I ran through for a rack?
Your integrity's out of wack
Look around the room, faces from everywhere on the map
Our bond is rap, you should honor that
But every card he act like he's as serious as a heart attack
But gotta lean on shock value to bring a body back
This preacher testified just to keep you mesmerized
You can't see through his disguise
You need to reconnect your eyes
I mean Jesus effing Christ, every freaking single rhyme
Like a Lebaneser mime in Lethal Weapon 5
And in your egotistic mind, you believe in every line
So we may never get to see this style you beat to death just die
Exposing D's deception gets him peeved in every line
I'm making this pussy tight: this a kegel exercise
See, people recognize this Dizaster character is not you
You had a Halloween party where rappers battled in costume
You made them stay in fake persona
Instead of going off real life, so you won't have to be the only one who knows what that feels like
See, he'll strike when he steps out of his lane and gets bold
But you ain't really from the gutter, you're just playin' a role
So please, spare us, spare us
You ain't cookin' coke, you ain't never seen the hood befo'
You sweeter than a Tootsie Roll
Wrapped up in some cookie dough
Shoved inside a pussy hole of a virgin playing footsie toe
Your Gjonaj battle is the only time you pushed an O
And when you fucked up that jelly fish line
What Dizaster revealed up here
Is what you mean to yell in your rhymes isn't actually real, it's clear
See, I'm a man of war when I'm on a sting
Your death's been sealed
My lines lean up to a body, I tend to kill
I flew here to get the mileage, you flew here to get demolished
What they paid you pays your rent
'Bout to put my kid through college
If you take away the hype, all the hate and spite. Just to lose to Mook they gave me twice what you got paid tonight
Yo, my status may have fell, but when our check's coming through
You'll see that even when I take an L, I get double you
Yeah, I went over with Lyt, but tonight I'll respect time
I said I'd kill you with three minutes, and we right at the deadline

[Round 3: Dizaster]
Yo! Now this guy… really has pink eye [*Iron Solomon tries to get into Dizaster's face exposing his pink eye*]
Back off! ‘Cause I don't want to be in front you
You fricking disgrace!
You've already had it happen to you once
Don't make me rub some more shit in your face!
Here comes the guy whose career died a long time ago
In the year 3 King Of The Dot BC, 500 Grind Times ago
Comes a guy from the biased coast
Who's about to get all of his stripes revoked like Spider Loc's
See, you said in one of the lines you wrote
That the doctors prescribed you the same drugs as Michael
Okay, that means you use all kinds of dope
Just so your mind can cope
So know, if you had the chance to be the straw that broke the camel's back, you would use it to sniff a line of coke
Ever since Mook your career been on a declining slope
It's like Gary Coleman's last episode alive
That's a double meaning line: If you take the name of his show title and the way he died and combine them both
Then you'd finally know why this is his final stroke
Your fucking music career is one big giant Heimlich choke
You should've known with an album like Monster you would wind up broke, it's all in your bio
Didn't see a single sell from it or multiply in growth
Since your career was under the spotlight of the microscope
What, do I gotta break it down in a science course or somethin'?
Iron divides into four different types of isotopes
Which could explain why you spent half of your life
On the shelf tryna blow, but Iron won't
See, a lot of elements become radioactive after their half life
But Iron don't, which is why he's a normal Iran, I suppose
‘Cause all the deals they had for him on the table folded
And they never got Iron closed
Yeah, that's why you're hanging from a thread on life support
You fucking got beat down in front of Mook
Until you couldn't fight no more
Which makes you the worst type of whore
The one that gets fucked once and quits ‘cause her vagina's sore
You should fucking kill yourself
Plus you violated as far as the guy code goes
I provided you guided roads wherever your drive go
I gave you the Geico quotes
The greatest of all time: the Michael Jordan of this entire sport
A satanic shrine logo: I am the G.O.A.T.
The Messiah, the eye of Horus
The Ayatollah to your Diaspora, I am your righteous Lord
I am your most high like a white boys Fico score
I am like Michael Kors ‘cause I can catch a big bag
And still have a lot of time in store
Get it? A big bag and still have a lot of time in store? Yeeeeah!
I'll hit you with a thousand lines like a Miley Cyrus tour
This is what Michael Moore would look like in his final form
I know you gon' reference the five days in Egypt
But trust me, this ain't that kind of war
This is more like fighting Thor inside of a lightning storm
I go psycho: Michael Myers with a knife inside of a psych ward cycle flow Niacin, goodnight you, bro
I'll put you to sleep in your own language: I'll Laila Tov you
Yeah, this diet Rone is gonna die alone
All it takes is one solid bar
He's a washed up body, punchlines are like Dial soap
Dynamo, you tryin' to fight a robot cyborg from Biocorps
They'll find you inside your home beside your phone
With your vital signs synchronized with the dial tone, BLEEEEP
Who gives a fuck if NY is a no-flying zone?
I got Palestine inside my bones
I'll hit you with a rock in your face from a couple kilometers away
That's what I call reaching a milestone
You will die from my pen stroke like Death Note
If it's written form we battle
Freestyle, I'll son you off the top like solar panels
And I got more examples
No matter how many menorah lamps you have
You'll never hold a candle
To the levels of pressure I was born to handle
You know why? ‘Cause you don't have no souls or backbones
Bro, you don't even know your past, bro
Real Jews were Hebrews, black men who used to grow their afros
You guys are just a bunch of random, phony, Polish assholes
Who forged your passports, and don't have a land of your own
So you come over and they jack yours
But what is it all for? Is it drilling off shore?
Is it the land, or do you want more?
See, Arabs were peaceful, bro, you can come into my house
I'd invite you in, take your keys to my car, the garage door
I just want you to feel comfortable at home
Since you're used to occupying households that are not yours
I wasn't even supposed to be here today
Organik was tryin' to get him and Hollow Da Don poppin' off
They had an investor from his side ready to put up all the guap
Made all these excuses at the end why it ended up fallin' off
But the real reason we did not see it
Is 'cause Solomon's people couldn't afford what Hollow cost
I ain't anti-Semitic, knock it off!
Before I go durka durka, allahu Akbar on him
And start letting rockets off
Droppin' bombs and launchin' tomahawks
I got a lot of fire bottled up like a walkin' Molotov
I'm a blacksmith: I'll put an Iron bar on the chopping block
I don't give a fuck if it's shalom shabbat or shabbat shalom
I'll punch you in the face
And leave your glasses broken on the floor: mazel tov!
You battled Mook on Smack and we watched you fall
You let a mark-ass brother outshine you
Take your spot: you Pau Gasol, and that's when you got on some bullshit and you dropped the ball
Now everyone knows you as that one cat
With a giant pussy in his lap like Marley Marl
It's the army of God
Think the ending of every Inspector Gadget, ‘cause all you saw
Was me putting a metal arm to this cat's head like Dr. Claw!
I know a little bit of Krav Maga
Fuckin' put your— twist your father into an arm bar
And knock his fucking yamaka off, fuck it
If me and Solomon brawl I'm knockin' out anybody involved
Boop Boppity Baow, stand over your head like Alex star
I'm off the hook with these hands, people call me Kabal
I move at light speeds like Vegeta
Break my right knee off in your jaw
Fuck a gun bar! I'm creative, I don't need one at all
I'll swing a fucking Pirates Of The Caribbean claw
Cut you in half, looking like a seesaw
Send the blade flying clean through the wall
Watch it come out of the side of the street
And kill five people that weren't even involved
I'm like an evil Peter Parker that delivers people karma
With a side order of beef kebab for starters
Fucking with me is retarded
Like asking Sweeney Todd to be your barber
I'm an evil Tamil-tiger guerrilla fighter from Sri Lanka
Followed you to your job and I'm camped outside of your job
And I can't wait for you to leave the office like Stephen Harper
Yeah, you think you can relate to Canadians more than me?
Hahaha! Bro, you are more pussy than a Weeknd concert
Even the concept of you beating me here in Toronto
Couldn't be more farther
Than the thought of Stevie Wonder being able to see his daughter
I'll fucking let the Glock sleep him
Put him in an arm bar 'til he stops breathin'
Like Eric Gardner when the cops beat him
Pay attention, that's a double bar meaning
I mean, either way you gon' die from arm squeezing
And yeah, they hated us
They hated us ever since the World Trade got hit
And they blamed us with all this bullshit
But what the media don't say is this
How many of your people didn't show up to work that day ‘cause they claimed they were sick?
Or the Zionist banker who took out that insurance claim
And then split? Explain to me this
How a national tragic event could make your people rich
Or how a bunch of cavemen in Afghanistan
Could penetrate the world's most sophisticated defense
And have these monolithic beams that are encased in cement
All cut at the precise angle you need a buildings foundation to slip
It's ‘cause you motherfuckers orchestrated the shit
And used the media as a tool to blame us swit, wit
To blame us swit wit? Or blame us with?
But it don't matter because you blamed the desert
For taking those plane flights
But it's clear as daylight that you staged that shit
And you only have one ball… I mean, it's all good, bro
Don't be mad ‘cause the doctor slashed your wontons
And you can't get a hard-on
You can still be the champ of any track you hop on
Even with half of your balls gone
You could ask Lance Armstrong
You could still be successful, it doesn't change at all
Look, look, man, you can ask Tom Brady, dawg
You can still make it in the game with a deflated ball
I know, I know… I bet that little ball of his at night gets lonely
Sitting in bed, he felt a trickle down his leg slowly
Thought he pissed on himself, but turned out to be his right nut pouring out liquor for his dead homie
He has one fucking ball, he can't fuck with me
This is the path toward the end, so listen and pay attention
‘Cause all your people ever did was scrutinize us
My people are true survivors
And you used the media as a way to oppress us
And generation after generation you try to euthanize us
Then we turn into revolution fighters
But what would you do if you was in a street seeing them kill women and execute their minors?
Shooting a child in his back? How could you justify seeing a two-year-old with a tank on his back like a scuba diver?
T'foo ealaykun, t'foo! Who grew al-Qaeda?
You grew al-Qaeda! You guys are fueling ISIS!
This ain't no war on terrorism, this is a Zionist Jewish crisis
A bunch of fucking greedy bankers
Who have no value for what human life is
If you ever, if you ever see an Arab group of snipers
Just know that's from weapons that you provide us
So we can kill each other
And you can use it as an excuse to crucify us
But not now, not now… I'ma flip out
Bro, who defied us? Who divide us?
What am I doing? I'm losing my mind, bitch
Give me the shit, I'm gonna fushalise this
I don't give a fuck what I'm gonna do, ‘cause this dude's the nicest

[Round 3: Iron Solomon]
So y'all wanna know the REAL reason that we had problems in Grind Time? It was-it was… ah… shit... me too
Might've been all in this guy's mind
I mean, when I picture what was at stake and follow the timeline
D was only beefing because I was in my prime
‘Cause we had never met before
They had rappers on every floor
And you paid Kap Kallous to book my room next to yours
Since you don't know the difference
Between real life and a message board
You trolled the hallway all day, postin' up on my bedroom door
The whole weekend you followed me, no drama or static
Then hopped on camera in your battle and you called me a faggot
And I'll never forget this, with Pumpkinhead as my witness
You ran right out of the ring to me and begged for forgiveness
It was awkward and kind of just weird
Offered to buy me a beer
Talking right in my ear, apologizing for years
About a line that Bachir took time to prepare that I didn't hear
‘Cause I wasn't watching your battle, because I didn't care!
See, between love and hate there's a thin line
But for Diz, no disconnect
So everybody that Diz respects becomes someone he disrespects
From the indirects to the blatant hate
In your Twitter rants you've discussed me
But you're on my dick the second we're face to face
Tryin' to give me dap – you disgust me
With your rants and your ten page speeches
Talking junk about Smack more than an N.A. meeting
If you and URL's relationships something you can't repair
You know what a real gangster would do?! Just not battle there
What's wrong with King of the Dot? Know what I'm saying?
You hate the East Coast ‘cause we never gave you support
We gave you hip hop culture, Diz, we gave you this sport
The way that you walk
Your dress code, the slang that you talk
You from the ""Fresh Coast""?
Son, the word ""fresh"" came from New York
You pull your iPhone out at all of your battles
An awesome example
Of how all of the raps that you spit you got from the Apple
Y'all know that his note section is just a pad full of writtens
So what, it's cool to do that now ‘cause Canibus did it?
You such a hip hop purist
How's that a crutch you still rely on?
We've seen Diz sell out in battles more than Melathion
You call street rappers phony, but your gun bars be dialed out
It's like you can't get a line out without a 9 now
The principles even talking, we don't ever see him walking
It's all theory, you don't really stand for shit: you Stephen Hawking
It's so feeble, Flint Michigan tap water: your flow's lethal
But only because the poison you fed 'em misled your own people
You're not a terrorist, you're a tourist, a gimmick
Pointing your fingers at our flaws like a critic
To hide your fraudulent image
The real perpetrator's you, but you don't want to admit it
You're like the coward that killed Cyrus
And said ""The Warriors did it!"" – Oh. You. Fucking. Hypocrite!
You whore for attention, you exhibitionist
You preach, but you don't practice
Give a speech and contradict the shit
You overdose with coke in the nose, emotional roller coaster
You opportunist, you Brutus, Judas, you culture vulture!
I hate you, but it's my fault, because I stepped out of this ring
And turned my queen to my ex wifey
And I prayed her new suitor would be a king who was just like me
I walked away from this woman who was the love of my life
And I can't stand that her new man just ain't fucking her right
See, when you was still tryna steer through the bottom tier
And the future of battle rap was not as clear, I was here
Been a pioneer the entirety of my career
I made this backpack shit take off: I'm the Rocketeer
I spelled out this path to give y'all some direction
Put myself on the map so you could follow the legend
What I deserve I achieve with just a verse and a beat
I didn't work for a fee, and what I earned wasn't free
Went on a murdering spree, hit every curb in the street
When it was 30 degrees I was still burning MC's
In terms of this league, my words and my schemes
Are the birds and the bees, the sperm and the seeds
What emerged was this league
So you're the MC you are because you are birthed from my breed
I didn't quit and come back, I took maternity leave
I fathered your whole existence, Diz, you learned this from me
You played the role of an heir you're unworthy to be
You're not Solomon reborn, you've been keeping my seat warm
A disfigured version of me, that's how D formed
And the Commodore and Eli might seem like a lovely option
'Til you realize, in real life
What it feels like without Nucky Thompson
Let Diz, Pat and Mac scrap for seconds and thirds

Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth
Would care to know my name
Would care to feel my hurt?
Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star
Would choose to light the way
For my ever wandering heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who You are

[Chorus]
I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed in the ocean
A vapor in the wind
Still, You hear me when I'm calling
Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
And You've told me who I am
I am Yours, I am Yours

[Verse 2]
Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin
Would look on me with love and watch me rise again?
Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea
Would call out through the rain
And calm the storm in me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who You are

[Chorus]
I am a flower quickly fading

A vapor in the wind
Still, You hear me when I'm calling

Will I be redeemed if I seal my fate
I'll do my penance and rosary
But will you pray for my purity

When in the springtime of the year
When the trees are crowned with leaves
When the ash and oak and the birch and yew
Are dressed in ribbons fair

When owls call the breathless moon
In the blue veil of the night
The shadows of the trees appear
Amidst the lantern light

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

Who will go down to those shady groves
And summon the shadows there
And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms
In the springtime of the year

The songs of birds seem to fill the wood
That when the fiddler plays
All their voices can be heard
Long past their woodland days

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

And so they linked their hands and danced
Round in circles and in rows
And so the journey of the night descends
When all the shades are gone

A garland gay we bring you here
And at your door we stand
It is a sprout well budded out
The work of our Lord's hand

276,Do For Love,"[Intro: 2Pac]
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Outro: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

277,Second Round K.O.,"[Intro: Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus, man, what's up, man?
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man, you were booming
But I caught these foul slouch-ass niggas, you know I mean?
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard, man, I wasn't with that
But I ain't know you well enough to defend you though, right?
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game, man, they've been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times
Did right, you know what I mean?
But they can't hurt us, man, we gonna do it
Get up in this ring, man, put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself, man
You don't got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you, man, get up in there, move that head, man
Come on to me, man, but when you come, man
You gotta come for blood, man
Come up to me, man, come on, bust that nigga whole
Man, niggas talking that shit about you
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's for lunch, breakfast
Hey, man, they been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times, did right?
No, but they can't hurt us, man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself, man

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, something that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only dropping clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Fronting like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showing off your body ‘cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me ‘cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me? You must be crazy
You dripping with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga

[Interlude: Mike Tyson]
Yo Canibus, man, you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch-ass niggas hanging out with me, man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
We come out or don't come out at all

[Verse 2: Canibus]
You better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force
Blast you with a .45 Colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
‘Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul, rest in peace, kid
It's because of him now at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is something different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feeling himself ‘cause he got more cheddar than him
Well, let me tell you something, you might got more cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse, fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second and third born
Make your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say ""Naw, he started it, he forgot what a hardcore artist is""
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself, trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it? Fuck that!
‘Cause like Common and Cube, I see the bitch in you
And I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker

[Interlude: Referee]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out
3 minutes and 40 seconds, Can-i-bus

[Outro: Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus man, you moving like Mike Tyson Jr
Man, you in-and-out, and you're agile with your flow, man
But dig right, you got to eat, man
That's your name Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas, man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holding the mic with you, but dig right
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus, your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's
For lunch, breakfast, dinner; that's your agenda, baby
Your agenda to consume them

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems

Suggest little nice things I should do

All I seem to think about is you
And how...

Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go

Blow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up

The days are longer and seems like I'm facing time
I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasing mine

If you bad, turn around girl, let me see you do it

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
Girl you look sexy with your clothes on
You even look better with nothin' on
And we don't ever turn down, we stays turned up
Ain't that what we here for
VIP wherever we at, tomorrow night we might relapse
So back that ass up like Juvi' cause you already know I need that

Gone 'head girl, twerk it all on me
I need it for you to work it all on me
We ain't leavin' 'til the sun come up, baby

Party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party

Turn around girl, let me see you do it
Turn around girl, let me see you do it

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
I keep her straight like a band too
I keep it straight like 12:30
I fuck over your girl hair do
If it's curly I straighten it, if it's straightened, I leave it curly
You look good standin' next to me
There ain't enough room, we need to get a suite
And if my momma had another child
Then she would've had an extra G
Fuck that, flip that, that soul
She need a pole by the stove
She cookin' eggs and she twerkin'
You might just think I'm perverted
But she ain't got on no clothes, Hootie Hoo
Exit the club to the Trump
And her back is so fat you can see from the front
And I walk in, this bitch smellin' like joints

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
I don't wanna hold your hand
Girl tonight I got other plans
I just want to see you throw it back
Back on me and let me see if I can catch all of that

[Hook]
Party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party

Let me play some of nothin' for your ears
Well, I sat down and listened to him say
Love keeps gettin' in the way

Well, how many times will I fall in love
With a girl that was my friend?
You see love is a hole in the middle of my heart
Like a well that has no end and I said

Oh yeah, I know what you mean

There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said

Let me tell you about something that you don't know

Love keeps gettin' in the way

And how many times will I fall in love
With a boy that was my friend?
You see love is a pole that blocks the door
With a key the boy can't lend and I said

Leave it all behind, but I've been thinkin', yeah, I've been thinkin'
We can put it all together babe, we've got plenty of time

I remember sittin' 'neath the stars
Talkin' 'bout love in a broken down car
He said, what are we gonna do, we've lost our way
And love keeps gettin' in the way

Well, I replied to the question on his face
Said, love's not a time or a convenient place
Got rocks in you shoes, you gotta fly
If it's love there is no question why, he said

Oh yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean

286,A Rose Is Still A Rose,"There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey, hey
Mmm, she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you
Cause.......

[Chorus:]
A rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else
And now you're so tough tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh, oh, yeah When shegets nearer
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

[Chorus]

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Don't believe that life is  over
Just because your man is gone

Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on

Have the whole world up on Silkk the Shocker and Master P hits
See it ain't No Limit, it's only the beginning
Watch us ball y'all want us to fall to the wall, huh gon' be a minute
And see I get the rhymes written with Beats By the Pound shit
It sounds sick, Rolex with baguettes all around it
Now take us out the ghetto and live up on top
Takin' flights and shoppin' sprees, hop on forty foot yachts
See money don't change me, make me live a lil' bit good
Took some of my family members and homies out the hood
See we ghetto millionaires far away when we meet
I think they watch us P, cover our mouth when we speak
See I'm  too deep to change, everybody know my name
I guess I gotta charge it to the game

Peep game, got a Benz, Lex, Luger, and an Audi
Don't hate me, the money don't make me
It's gonna take two hundred million just to break me
Cuz I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya
I like that doja but hate the rollers
Cristal, green and Hennessey
Got three maids, a butler, and a Bentley

House full of floors that's marble
A brand new Ferrari, parked it when I bought it
See I'm a No Limit soldier I came to get it started
What ya, what ya think I'm all about my bank
Tryin' to be a multi-million before I'm old enough to drank
Now we can ride bro, no lie bro
See nobody be here besides us so go 'head and fire it up

Soldiers from Texas all the way to Jersey

293,Romeo And Juliet,"SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

Enter ROMEO

ROMEO
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

JULIET appears above at a window

But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!

JULIET
Ay me!

ROMEO
She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

JULIET
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO
I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

JULIET
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

JULIET
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET
I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

ROMEO
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.

JULIET
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

JULIET
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO
What shall I swear by?

JULIET
Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO
If my heart's dear love--

JULIET
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEO
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

ROMEO
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.

ROMEO
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

JULIET
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

Nurse calls within

I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

Exit, above

ROMEO
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,

Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

NURSE
[Within] Madam!

JULIET
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--

NURSE
[Within] Madam!

JULIET
By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.

ROMEO
So thrive my soul--

JULIET
A thousand times good night!

Exit, above

ROMEO
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

Retiring

Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!

JULIET
Romeo!

ROMEO
My dear?

JULIET
At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO
At the hour of nine.

JULIET
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO
Let me stand here till thou remember it.

JULIET
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.

ROMEO
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

JULIET
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO
I would I were thy bird.

JULIET
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

Exit above

ROMEO
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly [father's] cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

294,Too Much,"[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
(Don't do that..)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense

Keep walking till the fever is gone

That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arm from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still these voices in my head
They keep talking weaving their spell
But I'm talking to myself
I keep em talking to daylight to dawn
Till you're out of my bones

297,Rain,"[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized

Sittin' here in this chair waitin' on you

But not a word do you say
You won't even look my way

Talking â€˜til I'm black and blue
Ah, can't you see
I wanna get next to you
Dreams of you and I go sailing by
Whenever your eyes meet mine

And girl you make me feel so insecure
You're so beautiful and pure
Why must you be so unkind

Girl my money is low and I know
That I can't take you to the fancy places you might wanna go
Still I wanna get next to you
Ah I wanna get next to you

Whatever it takes to please you I'm willing to do

With pimp status and a hot name, we don't gotta pop thangs
They was serving the rock 'caine, then I came
Flippin flows like hoes when Twista drop game
It's like, awww suki suki now, lookie here
Sing a phrase while I trace on my hog road
Devine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin and she peepin that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin, deep as the Mediterranean

[Peter Gunz]
New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam
Ho damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat
Splat, like deja vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
And beat her, niggas in the Bronx call me Lex
Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex, and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't no time to fold

[Pre-Hook: Peter Gunz]
New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

[Hook: Lord Tariq (Peter Gunz)]
But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)
Now if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)

[Lord Tariq]
Yo the RM-80, is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
Thinking shit's gravy; stop me? Maybe
I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments
On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Recaro, two quarters of my life
Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharaoh, bought a new five
With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggas keep they own shadow
And I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggas rock gravel
Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out
From dusk 'til dawn and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about
And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
Cause you's a small-time nigga, bout a half an ounce now

[Pre-Hook: Peter Gunz]
New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play

Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from

302,Gone Till November,"[Intro]
I dedicate this record, The Carnival, to all you brothers takin' long trips down south, Virginia, Baltimore, all around the world, and your girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back. She's sittin' back in the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in, POW!, in the middle of the night, and this is what I told her for you

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

[Verse 1]
When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother, ""Go to school in September""
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, Jerry, wear his condom
If you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump
Woh oh oh oh
You sucker MC's, you got no flow
I heard your style, you're s-o s-o

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November

I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

[Verse 2]
I had to flip nuttin' and turn it into somethin'
Hip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a pumpkin
Commit treason, then I'll have a reason to hunt you down
It's only right, it's rappin' season
Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice
Your voice, I'll make a hearse out of your Rolls Royce
Besides, I got my girl to remember
And I'll commit it that I'll be back in November

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5

Ugh, I told her stick to your grind hustler
You beautifully exceptional, professional mind fucker
You're puttin' on a show, and I'm payin' the sponsorship
Damn you know you made it when haters payin' you compliments
Accomplishments for you come on a nightly basis
The way you killin' these niggas baby you might be racist
You might be racin' but fuck it that's life, embrace it
Success is sweeter than freedom, why live your life complacent

305,Light In Your Eyes,"I can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye
All our ""I love you""s were just not enough to survive
Something your eyes never told me
But it's only now too plain to see
Brilliant disguise when you hold me
And I'm free

I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude
Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use
But how could I have known girl
It was time and not space you would need
Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know
But would you believe

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
There's a place in your heart where I used to be
Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you
Constant reminder of all the things you get used to
Is there a chance in Hell or Heaven
That there's still something here to build on
Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall
But after all

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
And a song in the words that you spoke to me
Was I wrong to believe in your melody
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Should I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading away
Fading away

It's been a while since I've seen you so how have you been
Did you get my letter I wrote you that I did not send
I tried to call your old number
But the voice that I heard on the phone
I recognized but she told me the number was wrong

There's a light in my eyes it's too bright to see
And a pain in my heart where you used to be
Guess I was wrong to assume that you were waiting here for me
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me",Blessid Union of Souls,1998,"[98, 91, 94, 91, 79, 81, 81, 76, 78, 76, 68, 60, 58, 56, 53, 54, 48, 48, 48]",19

Listen to reason
And understand
And think of me
From way back when

He said: ""Me and Melissa
Well we fell out of love
We ran out of luck
Seems like lightning struck

I've been thinking of leaving
But I can't raise a buck
James, I'm wondering
Could I borrow your truck?

I said: ""That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Got no better reason
That's why I'm standing before you (that's why I'm here)
That's why I'm here""

John's gone
Found dead
He dies high
He's brown bread

Later said to have drowned in his bed
After the laughter
The wave of the dread
It hits us like a ton of lead

It seems ""learn not to burn""
Means to turn on a dime
And walk on if you're walking
Even if it's an uphill climb

And try to remember
That working's no crime
Just don't let them take
And waste your time

That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
There'll be no more messes tonight
That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Whoa, that's why I'm here

This is an IOU
I reckon I owe you one now
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria
This'll be better tomorrow

Fortune and fame's
Such a curious game
Perfect strangers
Can call you by name

Pay good money
To hear Fire and Rain
Again and again
And again

Some are like summer
Coming back every year
Got your baby
Got your blanket
Got your bucket of beer

I break into a grin
From ear to ear
And suddenly
It's perfectly clear

That's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)
Sing it tonight, tomorrow and everyday
That's why I'm standing (that's why I'm here)
Oh that's why I'm here

This is the part
About Kitty and Bim
He loved her
And she loved him

Wake them up
Shake them up
The middle of the night
Got to tell me everything's alright

Sayin, that's why I'm here (that's why I'm here)

What the deal playboy, just rest your soul
I be holding it down yo, still love the dough
Got these ladies on the cock now you know how we go
Got the whole world on lock down you know how we flow
Don't worry about Brooklyn, I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit the Commission remains
Niggas can cross the T's and, dots the I's
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm taking this rap shit serious, to my demise
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise
Basics in the basement, wasted
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
My hatred is, fueled just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?

About to redefine rap mami, either I'm
The illest nigga doing it or these niggas is losing it
I read a article that said I was ruining shit
But every time I look, I'm moving units in quick
So I'ma hit y'all, with these last two and split
And leave niggas with nothing but my influences-es
Students of Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit
I'm the type to buy a Rollie and just ice my shit
On the spot, fuck coming back twice to shit
How real is that? My floss game, still intact
Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 in '89
And drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?

I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough
Plus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks
Had it locked 'til I came in the club, Take 6
Got your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure, hair done by Dominicans, all for what
So I could be in a dark corner, all in her butt
At the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name
I ain't a player, get it right, I'm controlling the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame

It’s been thirty six days
And a couple hours since I saw your face
And the words you whispered left me in a daze
I've been memorizing every single phrase
You said as you walked away

An ocean in between us, can never separate us
Though we’re a million miles apart
My love goes any distance
Traveling with no resistance
I might be far away, but I've got your heart

[Chorus A]

Whenever you're in need of my arms again
Instead of looking out from the dirty window pane
Go out and kiss the rain
Go out and kiss the rain

Go out and kiss the rain (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)

[Verse 2]
I can stay another week
Then your time is up, no longer yours to keep
And the sunshine and the rain is bittersweet
So bittersweet

An ocean in between us, can never separate us
Though we’re a million miles apart
My love goes any distance
Traveling with no resistance
I might be far away, but I've got your heart

[Chorus B]
Whenever you're in need of my arms again
Instead of looking out from the dirty window pane
Go out and kiss the rain
Go out and kiss the rain
I'm in every raindrop, never will stop now

Go out and kiss the rain (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)

(kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)

[Bridge]
I wanna run through a thunderstorm here and now
Just to feel your touch on my lips (aaahhh)
And I’ll be waiting for you under the biggest cloud
Never knew a love this

[Chorus C]
Whenever you're in need of my arms again
Instead of looking out from the dirty window pane
Go out and kiss the rain
Go out and kiss the rain
I'm in every raindrop, never will stop now

I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said

“Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.”

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you…

I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn",Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,1998,"[90, 72, 72, 68, 71, 71, 70, 64, 65, 61, 60, 58, 56, 52, 54, 54, 57, 65, 74, 90]",20
323,Love Me Good,"[Verse 1]
Do you feel this day close with the sun on your back?
Did your mind leave you blind from the visions of past?
I would suggest staying off your feet
And maybe some rest is really all that you need

[Verse 2]
Our unkilled hand understands but we are young and in love
Lots of whirl, should we dwell in the things we speak of
I must confess there's a part of me
That's scared to progress, be unassertive

[Chorus]
Love me good
I think you're gonna love me good
Think you're gonna love me good
Just like you know you should

[Bridge]
If I had the wisdom of years
I'd be better at avoiding theses tears
But for now I'll swallow all my fears
I think you're gonna love me good
Think you're gonna love me like you should

[Verse 3]
So the seams in my chest maybe double of thread
Know that silence can test even the clearest of heads
If I can see after this haze is gone
Then maybe I'll be ready to be the one

[Pre-Chorus]
The one that you love
The one that you love
The one that you love
The one that you

[Chorus]
Love me good
(I think you're gonna) love me good
(The one that you) love me good
(I think you're gonna) love me good

(The one that you) love me good

324,Pink,"[Intro: Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, ""What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?""
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, ""Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job""
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice

330,I Don't Ever Want To See You Again,"[Verse 1]
Early one mornin'
While you were asleep
I received a letter
But there was no addressee
So I paid it no mind, in fact
I wanted to send it back
But something that I was feeling
Said open it
It said, ""Dear reader
Once close friend of mine
Hope that this letter finds you in time
Cause your love is endin'
And my life's just beginnin'
With a woman that I know you hold dear to you""
And it made me wanna say

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
I don't ever wanna see you again, no, yeah
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

[Verse 2]
It took me a minute to wake up and see
What the love of my life was doin' to me
I wanted to lay down and die
Cause my pride wouldn't let me cry
But somehow I knew I had to get over it
He said he couldn't understand
Until he felt your touch
Now he can see why I love you so much
And that's so unfair
I never thought I'd have to share
Your love that I thought was given
To only me and that's why

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
And I don't ever wanna see you again
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

[Bridge]
And you say you love me?
(And you said you love me baby)
Love must've been blind
Cause I sure didn't see this one comin'
(I once was blind but now I see)
My best friend, huh?
They say keep the one's you love close
(Why'd you have to be so low down?)
And your enemy's even closer
But I can't win for losin', girl
(You were the closest thing to me baby)
Cause the one I thought was a friend to me
Ended up being my true enemy
(Knowin' all of the pain you caused me)
Listen to me, baby
I gave you everything
My love and my ring
And you violated me

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna see you again
I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear (so clear)
And I can move on from here (move on from here)
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby (I'm gonna say a prayer for you baby)
I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't wanna see you no more)
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna see you again
(Never would be too soon)
But I stuck by you till the end
(I'd rather have a cold day in June)
And my conscience is clear
(So clear)
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
(I need you right now, but...)
I don't ever wanna see you again
(I don't ever wanna see you. You know I don't really need you)
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?

[Verse 1: Godemis]
Last thing I recall was I was turned up with the DJ
Pat shot, another Pat shot, passed out for like three days
Woke up to an orgy, like poor me and I couldn't look
Came to my senses, got naked and it was off the hook
I took uppers in that attic, downers in that basement
Fell into the sheet rock (sheet rock), left a wall with my face print
But don't trip 'cause it ain't shit, I keep a doctor on speed dial
Xannies in my back pocket, and Adderall in my weed pouch
Yeah, I'm off the hook, try again later, scratch surface, then layer
Speak backwards sin prayer, I'm Ray or John Mayer
City on lock like I'm mayor, hit the bomb drop, bet I'm there
Trigger up on top, respond flare, A.K.A. your mom's lair

Must be out or into something, better call me back

Don't be so hypersensitive, could have a heart attack

[Post-Hook: Ubiquitous]
Somebody call the EMS, what they need is an EKG
Gotta get 'em on the line for the good time, party looking D-E-A-D
Check her, one two, double check for the middywest

It be coming off the chain, now put it on the books
Better ask around, that shit was off the hook, yeah!

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
Wanna hop in, 'cause I got them off top
When it come to the chopping, spin 'em in a hot wind
In the pocket when I clock in, and there ain't no other option
'Cause I rhyme sick and y'all high-pitched
Sounding like shit or like first gear
With the gas down, and that's not the look
Ces off the hook, it's y'all worst fear
Now the world hears that I won't stop
But I can't stop, I can't quit now
Got girls here in that same spot
With them tank tops and their tits out
Had a daydream that we made out and then made off
You got dicked down, I swear to God if I squint hard
It's like Baywatch in this bitch now, ah!
Running with the main boss
Another day off, I'm like ""which town?"" I gotta sit down
I stake off and my Jane boss and my pitch loud and I, ugh
Smoke it on stage, I don't give a fuck if it's allowed
Light up your blunt, that's if you're proud
Four hands up when I hit the crowd, see
Some they pay and some they go
Some complain and some they boast
Some people really do things and others saying some they wrote
Double dutchin' sayin' nothin' fucking playing, jumping rope
My shit bumping, type amazing find your way, ya compass broke

I don't know what happened, dog, I was sipping Jacky D
And next thing I know they offended
Hold up, just give me a minute
Admit that I was drinking like I was chasing a pendant
They gave me a shot of Patrón, a shot of crown and Hennessy
Don't make no sense to me
I don't know what the fuck has gotten into me
Niggas bugging tryna make me the enemy
Nothing compare to try to drain my energy
Fuck what you doin', Joey Cool an entity
Ain’t slowing down and I ain’t showing sympathy
We ain't related, homie, you ain't kin to me

Look at me, dog, you're girl probably into me
You don't want problems, well it a be it a be

Got me feeling like fight night
Make a path for them wild ones

Which one of y'all finna roll up?
'Cause this bitch ain't finna be popping here

You from the projects, but so exotic
Just give me all of that pussy, so many options (so many options)
Girl, you got me callin', all these different numbers
Why you being selfish? You know that I want you
You be leavin' work and you deserve a Birkin
Girl, you so contagious, damn that shit so dangerous

[Chorus: PnB Rock, Jeremih & Both]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience

334,Sweet Surrender,"[Verse 1]
It doesn't mean much
It doesn't mean anything at all
The life I've left behind me
Is a cold room

[Verse 2]
I've crossed the last line
From where I can't return
Where every step I took in faith betrayed me
And led me from
My home

[Chorus]
Sweet surrender
Is all that I have to give

[Verse 3]
Take me in
No questions asked
You strip away the ugliness
That surrounds me
(Who are you?)

[Verse 4]
Are you an angel?
Am I already that gone?
I only hope that I won't disappoint you
When I'm down here on
My knees

335,All My Love,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

[Verse 2]
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find

That somebody else will scoop him up

Can't have that
Wanna be that girl that
Find herself a perfect match
Didn't wanna come off as bein' too fly

Got contact eye-to-eye
Then I walked over to him slowly
I know that you don't know me

337,Given To Fly,"[Verse 1]
He could've tuned in, tuned in
But he tuned out
A bad time, nothing could save him
Alone in a corridor, waiting, locked out
He got up outta there, ran for hundreds of miles
He made it to the ocean, had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up, set him down on his knee
A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw
Delivered him wings, ""Hey, look at me now""
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh, power, oh

[Chorus]
He's.. flying
Whole
High.. wide, oh

[Verse 2]
He floated back down cause he wanted to share
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere
But first he was stripped and then he was stabbed
By faceless men, well, fuckers
He still stands
And he still gives his love, he just gives it away
The love he receives is the love that is saved
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
A human being that was given to fly

Ugh, yeah
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind
And at this moment in time, I’m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god, you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, that’s my repertoire
Holla at honeys, ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?""

Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
While you worshiped other rappers that leave you less entertained

Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain

Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

You speak and I don't hear a word

What would happen if we kissed?
Would your tongue slip past my lips?
Would you run away?
Would you stay?
Or would I melt into you?
Mouth to mouth
Lust to lust
Spontaneously combust

Room is spinning
Out of control
You act like you didn't notice
You brushed my hand

Forbidden fruit
Ring on my finger
Your such a moral, moral man
Would you throw it away, no question?
Will I pretend I'm innocent?

What would happen if we kissed?
Would your tongue slip past my lips?
Would you run away?
Would you stay?
Or would I melt into you?
Mouth to mouth
Lust to lust
Spontaneously combust...
What would happen if we kissed?...
Ah...

I struggle with myself again
Quickly the walls are crumblin'
Don't know if I can turn away

What would happen if we kissed?
Would your tongue slip past my lips?
Would you run away?
Would you stay?
Or would I melt into you?
Mouth to mouth

If we kissed...
Would your tongue slip past my lips?

We can get together, we can do whatever
But you can't get no dough

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo, since the Mona video you been trackin' me down
Tryin' to figure out how I lookin'perso-nal, Baby
Forget looks tell me can you roll with crooks
The three hot niggas rising in the Billboard books, nigga
We look at things through the big lens, big picture
Big Benz we try and make CEO ends
The thick chicks love us, big dick style niggas
Cristal niggas, ya'll finesse this quick style niggas
You didn't love me when my name was Sean
Now you should see how bitches act when the Benjamins come on
But I ain't hatin' em, you gotta love the ways females play
Quickly use a neglige to getta get-away
Five stars where the willies stay, and Sheek pay for nothing
But thats what ya'll herbs get for frontin'
I spend wild chips gettin' drunk up in the China
Club, while you up in Skate Key wit a minor

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I know she wit it, I betta brick I could hit it
Black tie affair I gotta fresh pair of British
Ice Berg shirts with Ice along with it
Turquoise, 9-11 Porsche and it's tinted
But honey got alot of jazz, You gotta philly
You gotta bag, then she went inside the Prada bag
Blew two and she said it was choice, like my voice
My thug style made her cat moist
That's the realest shit I heard, that's my word
Regardless who she fucked, I'm the nigga she deserves
I put her on to holdin' birds, rockin' furs
Different ways to speak without using words
And even though she proper I still gotta drop her
Cuz Sheek dont like her, had a dream that he shot her
I can't buy you Escada, you get nada
I'm the bounce with a chick that look a little bit hotter

We can get together, we can do whatever
But you can't get no dough

They was never mine for me to dump em
Its just like checkers, after they make a move then I jump em
It's like this girlfriend I'ma keep it real
Every nigga with a deal ain't able to peel
I'm a Bad Boy so I'm caked up with whips
And guess what, I got more nuts than chips
And they gon' melt right in your mouth, not in your hand
You know that you ain't my girl, I'm not your man
But do you still wanna lick me?
Or is cause I'm a six figgy niggy, and I know Biggie
And I dont mess with no fat ladies
But if you pay like you weigh then you can stay, baby
PJ slide to tha mo like that
With this honey named trout cuz she blow like that
And when we finish don't look at me like I owe nothin'
Cuz if you really dig then let me know something

And her friend is tellin' Jay ""I hold a key on me.""
And I'm laughin' to myself, I got a key on me
And they friend in my ear like Lean On Me
Told her to get some bare backs and cream on me...

Yeak Sheek holler to these mommies ""Ven aqui...""
Gas 'em up easily and take 'em home with me
Who respect this, can't keep her hands off my necklace
If it's good, next week I'll put her on the guest list...

Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 1]
I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she say

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Verse 2]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said...

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
In the place we used to start our lives

Heartbreaks and promises, I’ve had more than my share
I’m tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere

I’m tired of getting caught up in those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody who will always be there

346,A Song For Mama,"The sun was coming up, I was coming back down
Mama called my phone, and said ""Son what happened now?""
Whiskey on my breath, smelling just like a bar
I could hear Mama crying, I think I broke her heart

I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through
All the nights you were praying, I should've prayed too
You gave me your heart, I gave nothing back to you
And I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through

Went off the deep end, getting high and I've been drinking
Told Mama goodbye, dammit I'm leaving
Cocaine in my blood stream, baptized in whiskey
The night I wrecked my truck, the good Lord was with me
I could feel my heart racing, and I'm slowly dying
In the back of my mind I could hear Mama crying

I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through
All the nights you were praying, I should've prayed too
You gave me your heart, I gave nothing back to you
And I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through

I got these scars, and I got these tattoos
But these blue eyes, Mama I got from you
These two hands taught me how to pray
I count my blessings, more every day

I'm sorry Mama for all the pain I put you through
All the nights you were praying, I should've prayed too
You live like an angel, for a sinner like me
You loved me through it all, I was a burned out fiend
You gave me your heart; I gave nothing back to you

I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through",Casey Daniels Band,1998,"[56, 51, 41, 36, 35, 25, 20, 13, 8, 7, 7, 8, 12, 12, 13, 8, 9]",17
347,We're Not Making Love No More,"[Verse One:]
Sure I've been in love a time or two
But in the end I still chose you
No one could ever make me feel this way
That's why it's killing me, what we're going through
Somehow thought 'tween me and you
Our love would stand the test of time and never ever fade

[Chorus:]
But we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to change
Won't it ever stay the same

[Verse Two:]
Girl I know that things aren't going right
But don't you think it deserves a fight
A love like ours don't happen everyday
And we're losing it right as we speak
And if we don't wake up, it's a memory
A time gone past, a love that sailed away

[Chorus]

I dream of lovers past and
I see a girl so sad cause
She lost the only man she loved
He went away

And it looks like we gonna get some cream from the pie

Verse 1: Ky-Mani

I always aim at the right gate
Make you bite ate
Running jooks on the lightweight
Monopolize jeans
Brooklyn hone my genes
Baby burners get squeezed
Move up movin' apartment twenty two m
Forty fours for the coolin'
Trips puttin' two in
Shadey broads off tour suin'
Who hate us
Little Kevin double down on eleven out in Vegas
Playin' Biggie
Mo money mo jiggy
Flig me
The more stones the more izee
Toxen
Smoking pain in the range with my nigga Shockem
Rose fed keep a road straight
Broken nose red
Baller bust we the dust
If you ain't eatin' it's us
Like we might fold
Servin' niggas frontin' like it's white gold
Dying hold the lying ain't the right goal

I'll cap your top call me John if you want lady

Verse 2: Prince Be

You ain't fresh
Unh-uh nah baby

You say you want trendy you say you want sheik
And honey dips rubbin' on your money clip
Hangin' at your place
Boardwalk and parkplace
Actin' all new
Look at you how ya livin'
Meanwhile your style's played out like racism
Me I'm fresh out of love it's quite tragic
When all they wanna do is inspect my gadget
And change a Superman to Clark Kent
All for the sake of fake amusment
She said what do you consider fun
If you can get it get it get it

Chorus

Verse 3: Ky-Mani

Said I been tryin' these rocky roads for so long
Still I had to hold on
I'm trying to make that dough to move on
Papa told me stay strong
Time has come to make that change
Woah
Here comes the sun there goes the rain
Take that first step to tommorrow
Hey hey
Life may bring you joy and sorrow
Woah
Now I'm dottin' my i's and crossin' my t's
Lordy I'm moving up
Takin' care of my biz

349,Say You'll Stay,"[Verse 1]
There's something in the air
A whisper in my ear
And I can't get it out of my mind
Maybe these butterflies are trying to tell us
There's something here that we need to find

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what love is up to these days
But it sure seems like it's hanging around

[Chorus]
So won't you say you'll stay
Even though we don't know what this is all about
Guess we'll just have to wait
To what we are we will eventually figure out
And all I know is that I want to be next to you
And right now there's no room for the world
So won't you stay
Please say you'll stay

[Verse 2]
Don't you run away just because you're afraid
Of something that feels out of control
We can take our time, just give it a try
'Cause there's no harm in taking it slow

Oh we don't know what love is up to these days
But it sure seems like it's hanging around

At Uncle Jamms Army jackin' fools for Filas
When Run DMC and Jam Master first bust
We was snatchin' mothafuckas outta Nissan trucks
Raised from a crew of real killers and knick kickers
That never ran on ya but was quick to put them hands on ya

Where y'all from them enemies don't act dumb
Y'all know where we from
It's that 15th letter 2 times with the S
Cut off Dickie wearing descendant from the West
Steady square dumping in the center where the crowd
With my flag on my head tied Aunt Jemima style
But ain't nobody trippin' cause we all about the ends
Plus fool I don't set trip I set trends

Who put in music in the world and spoken in rhyme
And it hurts me that I never really knew her
'Cause all it would have taken was some time

You know she always seems to be there when I stumbled
And when mountains got too steep for me to climb
And it tears me up to think I never touched her
'Cause all it would have taken was some time

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
I'm gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone I should know

Now she's in another place and I can't reach her
And I feel as though I'm guilty of a crime
I took all she had to give and gave her nothin'

Squint your eyes and look closer

I am 32 flavors and then some
And I'm beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
Cause someday you are gonna get hungry
And eat most of the words you just said

[Verse 2]
Both my parents taught me about goodwill
And I have done well by their names
Just the kindness I've lavished on strangers
Is more than I can explain
Still there's many who've turned out their porch lights
Just so I would think they were not home
And hid in the dark of their windows
Till I'd passed and left them alone

[Verse 3]
God help you if you are an ugly girl
Course, too pretty is also your doom
Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred
For the prettiest girl in the room
And God help you if you are a phoenix
And you dare to rise up from the ash
A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy
While you are just flying past

[Verse 4]
And I'll never try to give my life meaning
By demeaning you
But I would like to state for the record
I did everything that I could do
I'm not saying that I am a saint
I just don't want to live that way
No, I will never be a saint
But I will always say

Growlin' and smilin' while in the sun

And it's fly 'cause it's sittin' on Dayton's

The record skip but this girl kept dancin'
Prancin', grindin', grinnin', romancin'

She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast but this girl was faster
She's lookin' for a real good time
I said, ""Close your eyes, I got a surprise""

How will I go to sleep without her in my arms

Erasing all those plans we made together

On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth

Say you want me to win, but hope I lose

Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2"", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and

Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?

That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion, losing my religion

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?

Never dreaming, what we'd have to go through
Now here we are, I'm suddenly standing
At the beginning with you
No one told me, I was going to find you
Unexpected, what you did to my heart
When I lost hope
You were there to remind me
This is the start

Chorus:
And life is a road and I wanna keep goin'
Love is a river I wanna keep flowing
Life is a road now and forever wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm is through
In the end I want to be standing
At the beginning with you
We were strangers on a crazy adventure
Never dreaming how our dreams would come true
Now here we stand, unafraid of the future
At the beginning with you

(Repeat Chorus)
Knew there was somebody somewhere
I need love in the dark
Now I know my dream will live on
I've been waiting so long
Nothing is going to tear us apart

Love is a river I wanna keep flowin

Nobody thinks the way I do
I guess that nobody dares
Your head's so full of things
So set your mind free of them

Did you know that in the truth there's nothing stranger?
I suppose you think I think I know it all

Nobody hears the things I say
I guess that nobody cares
My head's so full of things

Empty heads full of fools
Now you see, I'm breaking all the rules (breaking all the rules)

And I know that you would love to know the answers

375,Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You),"[Intro]
Cool
Yeah
Uh-uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail
I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me?
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax

[Chorus 1]
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible

[Chorus 2]
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
Can't live without you (can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you

[Verse 2]
Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax, max

[Chorus 1]
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible
No, no

[Chorus 2]
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you

[Bridge]
Don't be stupid
My baby

[Chorus 2]
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
Can't live without you (can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you

[Chorus 1]
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible, impossible
Oh, no, no, no

[Outro]
Don't be, don't be, don't be, baby
Don/t be rediculous
No, no
Oh, don't me stupid",Shania Twain,1998,"[99, 86, 78, 68, 64, 64, 58, 54, 53, 49, 40, 43]",12
376,What If,"[Verse 1: Johnny Orlando]
Let's talk about all the things that we shouldn't talk about
Those kind of words that will change all the things we talk about
Tell me do you ever think of us?
Should I ask for more or should I stop?

[Pre-Chorus: Johnny Orlando]
What if a tomorrow means that we are here together?
What if we are taking chances just to lose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing the writing on the wall?

[Chorus: Both]
What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?

[Verse 2: Mackenzie Ziegler]
I hear everything they saying, saying 'bout us
It's not about right or wrong, it's about what we love
Would it be simple or would it be too complicated?
Should I keep going or maybe it's better to stop?

[Pre-Chorus: Mackenzie Ziegler]
What if a tomorrow means that we are here together?What if we are taking chances just to loose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing all the writing on the wall?

[Chorus: Both]
What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?


[Bridge: Johnny Orlando, Mackenzie Ziegler, Both]
What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I like you
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go

377,My Body,"[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I just started my sentence like a capital letter
Got bars for years, I hope you send me a letter
Know she'll never be queen, so now she got a vendetta
I ain't talkin' 'bout David when I say I'ma Guetta
Twenty mil' on my off, season of course
Twenty million when you ain't put out no album or tours
Yes, bitch, I'm me
Pretty N-I-C
You get it? Icy
But my name is spelled N-I-C

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I feel like we going under
Take me down
I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talking
I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin'
You could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies
And give you what you dream 'bout

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Stakes are higher than a mother
What you wanna bet that you'll never find another?
Like me, I'm once in a lifetime
Only get all of me once in your lifetime
I'll leave you drowning in your wet dream
Swimming in that love
Surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl you know I brought that thing right up out the darkness
Made that thing a starfish, right up on my swordfish
I'ma bring sparks and your favorite narcs
Ooooh, you raise the bar, you take it far, you rated R
But keep it tight tight, take this D, go night night
Go so far downtown on you, I lose Wi-Fi
Give me high five
'Cause you know you gon' need a goon to come lick, lick your wounds
Got you lit like tick tick tick, like tick tick tick
Tick tick, Tune

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

You ready Mase?
Party people in the place to be (Uh-huh)
It's about that time for us to (Yeah)
*Screams*

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck
Piece all glittered up, stick up kid, nigga what?
Jig with a cut sip Cris? Spit it up (Come on)
Ho's ride, get your nut 'till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I done hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall? Hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my fresh clothes (Come on)
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Whether friend or ex-friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end, come on

[Chorus: Kelly Price & Ma$e]
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (Yeah)
You make me feel so good (Bad boy)
You know you make me feel so good (Yeah)

I wouldn't change you if I could (Yeah)
I wouldn't change you if I could (Ah-ah)
Come on

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
You can't understand, we be Waikiki
Sippin' DP til' the TV, look 3D
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome BB's, they wanna be me
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just started seeing cars because they auctioned it
So while you daydream, my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybelline
One time you had it all, I ain't mad at y'all
Now give me the catalog
I'll show you how daddy ball (That's right)
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars, nigga
It's like y'all be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money (Come on now)

[Chorus: Kelly Price & Ma$e]
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (Yeah)
You make me feel so good (Come on)
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good

I wouldn't change you if I could (Come on)
I wouldn't change you if I could (Ah-ah)

[Bridge: Ma$e]
Do Mase got the ladies? (Yeah, yeah)
Do Puff drive Mercedes? (Yeah, yeah)
Take hits from the '80s? (Yeah, yeah)
But do it sound so crazy? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Well me personally, it's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE, smoke my Nestle
No mad rap-ASCAP, where my check be?
Problem with y'all I say it directly (That's right)
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to ménage in suites
Now I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls that used to hardly speak, come on

[Chorus: Kelly Price & Ma$e]
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (Yeah)
You make me feel so good (Uh-uh)
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
(Bad boy, that's what we do)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (Yeah)
I wouldn't change you if I could (Ah-ah)
I wouldn't change you if I could (Come on)
I wouldn't change you if I could (Let's go)

You make me feel so good (Uh-uh)
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good (Come on)

379,I'm Not A Player,"[Intro]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
You're my darlin' darlin' love
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I said you're everything I ever hoped for in a woman
And as long as I may live
Ooh, you're...

[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips until I bust a shot
It doesn't stop, I'm only beginnin', I'm bonin' your women
While you home all alone, I'm blowin' up in 'em
Sendin' them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motherfuckin' attitude
I'm just showin' you how this rapper do
Capital Punishment, when I'm up in it, suckin' it
Bustin' it out—nice blouse, let me unbutton it
You're fuckin' with King Papi Chulo when knockin' culo
Pop your mulos out the socket tryin' to ride with the sumo
You know my rise is high, word, I be drillin' 'em
Bitches be tryin' to ride, but the curve be killin' 'em
Fillin' 'em with the cash, my cheese premium unleaded
Come get it, first work the tongue, then let the Pun hit it
Split it in half, watch the gat, baby, take a bath
Be good, I might put away the wood and give you the mustache

[Chorus: The O'Jays & Big Punisher]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love

I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
I bang a stranger in my torture chamber
Feed the locas chocha pinga
While I force my finger where my bolas linger
I bring the pain like Method when I flex and flip the coochie
Puerto Rican to the core, but no Boriquas eat the pussy
'Scuse me for bein' blunt, but I've been eatin' cunts
Since pimps was pushin' pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin' and grindin', simultaneously grindin'
Climbin' up the walls, with my balls bangin' off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough, (ugh) bustin' in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place
Yo, bitches already know the repertoire
Step in my car, let's start the ménage à trois, like Escobar
By far, I'm the best at all sex positions, forget the kissin'
I'm skippin' the tongue-twistin', TS Tradition

[Chorus: The O'Jays & Big Punisher]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' baby..""
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

[Verse 3: Big Punisher]
Some chick in back of me, bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's
'Cause she heard I was packin' meat
I bagged the freak and hit the telly
Got the Phillies, lifted her belly
And ""Put it in Her Mouth,"" like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honeys got nothin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks, come back and fix your favorite dish
(Not!) You crazy bitch, I ain't with that, I'ma hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that? I'm the mack, doin' my thing
Pullin' your strings, makin' you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables, givin' you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin' your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you?

[Chorus: The O'Jays & Big Punisher]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby
I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
You're my darlin' darlin' love
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

Tied around her little finger

There's a devil in that angel face
If you could only see the love that you're wasting

'Cause, baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you better

So open up your eyes 'cause seein' is believin'

381,Tha Hop,"[Hook: Tray Deee]
I'm tired of that punk shit
Where niggas claim to done, where they from and who run shit
I bang it to the tip-top
Can't stop, won't stop, droppin gangbang hit rocks
To the last drip-drop
To the, tick tock to the blocks niggas rip Glocks
I'm knowin that this shit hot
This your first introduction to this motherfuckin crip hop

[Tray Deee]
It's time to research the documents and pull some files
And put it down with this gangsta style
Cause I be seein niggas bein more aggressive now
After peace treaty meetings and the weapons down
Sport Chucks 'member once it was Nikes and sandals
To me it's unlikely that you're sheisty and skanless
To manage this dramaticness I call my rep
Every step stay on deck keepin bustaz in check
Certified murder guide through the streets of death
Where the sleep ya slip soon as ya weakness met
From that real killer deal get ya steal and mash
Niggas have done did when the steel'll blast
Pockets filled with cash, fuck a Benz or Jag
Lookin rough in a bucket, tuckin tens and Macs
Dip roam, chip phones, flip (?) and clock
Lick shots at the cops and control your block
Keep it true with the crew from the old to new
Ride providin 'em with guidance like your 'sposed to do
Notice who, participatin all the activity
That's how we livin G, strictly killer tendencies
So death to all my enemies
And to the homies who rest in peace, a dub bag and Hennessy
These weak niggas killin me
With their proclivity to even proclimate that they as real as me

Yeah nigga this crip, crip, crip

On the East fuck peace we ridin violent
Fuck where you been it's all about where I been

Have a babysitter set that ass up for chip Chips Ahoy!

Keep it O.G. nigga, rewind and pass

382,The Day That She Left Tulsa (In A Chevy),"We were half a mile high on the ferris wheel
At our old county fair
I didn't even know we had trouble until
She told me way up there
That's when my life started spinning round
My world came crashing to the ground
The day that she left tulsa

Chorus
In a chevy in a hurry in the pourin down rain
With the caution lights flashin in the passin lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams goin down the drain
In a chevy in a hurry in the pourin' down rain

No she wasn't showin yet
But she'd be by Christmas time
Up there like a fool I took for granted it was mine
She never came out and told me that I was wrong
But all of a sudden the light came on
The day that she left tulsa

Chorus

I guess she thought the truth would end up drivin me away
But she was wrong but I never had the chance to say
The day that she left tulsa

Kicking back with all my friends
Think my battery has run out

Wonder why I get so scared

Trying to have herself a little fun
And she never knew what hit her
She never saw tomorrow come

387,Something That We Do,"[Verse 1]
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
I still believe the words we said
Forever will ring true
Love is certain, love is kind
Love is yours and love is mine
But it isn't somethin' that we find
It's somethin' that we do

[Verse 2]
It's holding tight, It's lettin' go
It's flyin' high and layin' low
It lets your strongest feelin's show
And your weakness too
It's a little and a lot to ask
An endless and a welcome task
Love isn't somethin' that we have
It's somethin' that we do

[Chorus]
We help to make each other all that we can be
Though we can find our strength and inspiration, independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start

[Verse 3]
It gives me heart remembering how
We started with a simple vow
There's so much to look back on now
Still it feels brand new
We're on a road that has no end
And each day we begin again
Love's not just somethin' that we're in
It's somethin' that we do

[Chorus]
We help to make each other all that we can be
We can find our strength and inspiration, independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start

[Verse 4]
Love is wide, love is long
Love is deep and love is strong
Love is why I love this song
And I hope you love it too
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
Love isn't just those words we said
It's somethin' that we do

[Outro]
There's no request, too big or small
We give ourselves, we give our all
Love isn't some place that we fall

Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick
Besides, kid wanna bust?
Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me
Jealous because I live more plush
Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush
Bring the ruckus, plus...
I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits
For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it
Socking it to niggas and rocking it
Dropping 'em on the spot
Heat up any block or record shop
Knocking you off of your socks
Guaranteed platinum, watch two of the coldest bitches get hot
I be the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
We some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?
I'm the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
And we some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?

[Outro: Da Brat]
I'm your nigga for life, baby (haha)
Let's continue to drive all this motherfuckers crazy
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, Timbaland, I see you, baby
I feel you, sock it to 'em, goddammit
It's 9-7, this the motherfuckin' bitch era

If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thug-n-harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me (like me)

[Krayzie]
How many mo days on this old earth can you see
It's a crime to me
So we should get ready for Armageddon
Cause I know God should be ready to roll
Do away with the wickedest shit like mr. police-man
And dog if you're ready then pump up ya fist in tha air
And then pray for the politicians freely; get an amen?
The last days of the last days

[Bizzy]
That's why I get high, that's why I get high
I'm holdin on to my soul
But nobody knows when it all unfolds
Then when I don't go
Remember the dead cause I all I got
I got under my arm we fall
BONE BONE muggin runnin through your door
Hoes speakin of the last time that I past
Charlie wanna hear ya BONE
But I can't go wrong
When I flip it to my song
Better turn it up
Cause you love that Thuggish Ruggish Bone, Bone, Bone
Crossroads what real cruel world
Now I doubt the journey of those lost souls
Who meant so much why wasn't I chose?
But it will not stop clones
Those shots don't drop BONE
Nooooooo no BONE
But if I could teach the world to be a thug like me
Everybody be thuggin in heaven eternally

[Layzie]
Everyday the world goes round and round
I see it's a small world after all
Cause I can go met and I greet with my fans
Smoke a little weed and have a little laugh with y'all
But every now and then I gets caught up in a playa hation
Lord what's wrong with the nation, erase em'
But if I could teach the world to be a thug just like me
You could live your lifestyle worry free
In the arms of the Lord eternally
No mystery, but check the essence of the story
The warrior wasteland warrior so true
Divine, it's mine, east 19-99
It's where ya gonna be find'in all of my kind, every time

[Chorus]
If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thug-n-harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me (like me)

[Krayzie]
(if I, if I)
We stand as united, but fall if divided
My thugs are the tightest
Cause God is our guidance, and they only define us
As killer and fighters, cuz the critics n writers
Backstab when they typing our story
The war to be warrior, that’s for sure
And as thugs we're more and more and more

[Wish]
I got, we got, too much shit to give, got shit to give
Especially but still understood by the older folks and little kids
Come on all of y'all
Follow me BONE (Bone), way to go, we know the way to go
Follow me follow me BONE
And that's why I stay high cause I got shit to deal with
And the government and these playa-haters out to kill Wish
Wanna hurt this but uhuh

Artillery you can't dung with
Nigga betta let it rest shit (shit)
To the little boys and girls all over the world
The shit that we say is for the streets not for you to go and do
Uh or to repeat, please if we can no more murder
How must I say this, if we can no more murder

[Chorus]
If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thug-n-harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me (like me)

[Verse 1]
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head

And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you ""no"", but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop"", but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you (Making me love you)

395,So Help Me Girl,"You could've kissed me, like this wasn't gonna last
Kept me from saying, something I'll never take back
You could've held me like there was no chance
Of me waking up where I am
You could've stopped short of every dream I've ever had

So help me girl, you've gone too far
It's way too late, to save my heart
The way it feels, each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me girl

Oh yeah
You gotta help me girl

You had to be there until the sun came up
Making last night feel like a vision of things yet to come
You just had to hold me like nobody else
Now look what you've gone and done
You had to love me, till I just can't get enough

Please, help me girl...

So help me girl, you've gone too far
It's way too late, to save my heart
The way it feels, each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself

So help me girl you've gone too far
It's way too late, to save my heart
The way it feels, each time we touch
I know I've never been so loved
And I can't help myself...
No, baby

396,You Know My Steez,"[Guru talking]
That makes me know that what we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

[Intro]
The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing(MCing), and
DJing (DJing), from your own mind (from your own mind,)
You know? (you know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show

[Verse 1: Guru]
Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles
Sporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtracting all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Dropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolving, on its axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searching for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez

[Hook]
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live, Keep it live)
To the beat y'all

[Verse 2]
The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacing the wax
I be bringing salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feeling more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed
And suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreading like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fucking grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness, carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
You know my steez
(You know my steez)

[Hook]
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
The mic

[Verse 3]
On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
Trying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick  why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond

Mobbin'
You claiming HOG wearing MOB gear
These are more than fashion logos
When you see us know what we're representing
And that's the Logos
Forever mobbin homie we are not a pack of bozos
Can't have a circle looking weird out here
That's the noble
Can't be slacking doing kingdom business
That's immobile
Remember that man will on talent
God say that's a no no
When it comes to the gospel the impact is global
Bring the heat got up to city
Like what happened at Chernobyl
Bring to the Father to put Christ holy order
Upon me
Was a zombie
Want the living water not talking Dasani
Gimme a sword and I say it's on
When it come to this army
We going to war but never fold
I'm not origami
We've been given the message to take to the masses
So I spend my days in deep meditation and practice
Seeking repentance it cleared me from my horrible actions
So I'm not a hypocrite as I travel over the atlas

[Verse 2: Justus]
It's the mob nigga
It's more than music it is ministry
Started by Sevin if he's Paul I am Timothy
We take the gospel where them Lugers and them hitters be
We're supplying this industry
You dying if you fidgety
They get to riding
If you sliding with the menace beings
We ain't hiding anything
He's bright and what we fitna bring
He's light
So if anything think twice
Before you get the swing
You might even get to me
But desire ain't gone be hid from me
My blood brother was a blood
Brotha when I was cuz
That's what the neighborhood does
They be stay bathing in blood
Babies raped in mud
Scabies sage and drugs
But greater is His love greater is His love
And He will return to judge and begin again
God man spit fire from the skull just like finish him
In the end when they see what we did
At a minimum we delivered him
And we live in him
I guess you call that synonym

[Chorus: Justus]
I gotta be honest
You really don't want these problems

Yeah Ghetto gospel
Bringing His love into where the thugs hang
They drug slang and it's nothing to hear a snub bang
I'm from the park homie
Better yank me out the blood gang
And left his mark on me when He saved me
That's a blood stain
On my momma I knew it since elementary
The way I'm getting down
I'll get threw in a cell eventually
A demon's spawn I was foolish
Thought hell was meant for me
But now I'm reading Psalms
When I suit up with hella infantry
Ahh
I seen a rope of sin
Strangle a heathen
But we invokers bringing hope to men
And manglin' demons
Baptize em
We splash whoever came to receive Him
Christ gang put up ya cash
Who wanna tangle this evenin'?
If you blastin the master you get chastised
We leave a serpent slain
Wet em with purple rain under black sky
I'm from the dark
Where life is harder than some crack pipes
I'm really out here nigga
I don't rap lies
No perpetrating the mission
I go berserk over the church or for the sake of the risen
They can insert me in the dirt
Or through the gate of a prison
I'd take a squirter to the face
Before I hesitate to say I'm a Christian
Yeshua
Came as a servant and He died for the lost
Paid our debt with His blood
He supplied what it cost
Showed us the Father
We'd rather follow idols that floss
Bottom line we are in sin commercializing His cross
If the game's bearing His name
Yet full of fame tricks and heretics
And it wears it in vain then we are supposed to judge it
As far as CHH I hate the culture of it
It doesn't look like Christ I'm not supposed to love it
Rough as raw hide
Nothing but the cross inside a hog's eye
Fadin' with satan
I let my paws fly
Touch not thy anointed boy
I am God's guy
Ice'll burn
Christ'll return before the MOB dies

[Verse: 1]
I can feel your touch
Everytime you move back with your push
And it feels so wet
Then I get my slow motion right there
(ooooohh I wanna love your body slow)
Everytime I count a punch
And the rules go
Always slow, toe to toe
If you don't know
They don't like that right attack
Damn right

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Come, don't rush
Ones that do, they're certain to get none
And it don't justify
Don't try to move too fast take your time
It's a bad thing to come and drive straight by
Trying to be the one to win your trust
Cause they don't know (yeah baby)
How you feel for sure
So take it slow
It's alright
I did dodge it

Let's break it down oh no (slow)
Baby let me take it slow with you

Slow it down take time right
Go fast girl (no) makes me pull from (no)
Won't you take your time

402,I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto,"[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 1]
I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 2]
Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh
And now Bush can't stop the hit
I predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas
Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Hook]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Yeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 3]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The Penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather I'd be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
(Just think if niggas decide to retaliate)
(Soulja in the house)
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Yeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto",2Pac,1998,"[94, 79, 76, 78, 73, 69, 77, 77]",8

Love was gonna have to wait

Just a-paying my own rent

Outside I see the rain is fallin', whoa oh
Inside I'm slowly dyin'
But the rain will hide my cryin', cryin', cryin'
And you...

[Pre-Chorus 1:Allure]
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

[Chorus 1:Allure]
I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

[112]
(Ooh I'm over you, oh yeah you, yes)

[Verse 2:Slim, (112), & Allure]
Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool, baby
(Why was I such a fool) Oh, yeah
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone

[Pre-Chorus 2:Allure & Slim]
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Tears will cause an inferno baby
Romance often fades why should I take the blame?
Why should... why should I?
You were the one who left me neglected
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected

[Chorus 2:Allure & 112]
I...
I gave you all of me (I gave you all of me)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
I...
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Over you

I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you... (Left me so confused)

I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few small repairs she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

407,Criminal,"[Intro]
A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? ‘Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?""
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
""Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing ‘cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird

[Verse 2]
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, ‘cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor ‘cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal!

Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets

Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck

How could the one who made me happy, make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me? So I can understand
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that
How could the one I gave my world to, throw my world away?
How could the one who said, ""I love you,"" say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to, just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to, go and break this heart of mine, tell me?

How could you be so cold to me

How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?

How could the one I shared my dreams with, take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure, bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me, somebody tell me please

How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?

413,4 Seasons Of Loneliness,"[Verse 1: Wanya & Nate]
I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

[Verse 2: Nathan & (Mike)]
Remember
The nights when (remember the night)
We closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

[Bridge: Wanya & (Mike)]
This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here

It might've been a nightmare

Well, I admit I've been a fool sometimes
I believe I may be losing you
It's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed
Under your spell and over my head
You took me in your arms, and you told me
We don't need to worry
But you, you never say your sorry

Keep this love alive for us, it's all I feel
How can we survive if we change what is real

I see the angel and the devil in your heart
I confess, either one is my addiction
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
But living in your arms, I can take it
Please don't make me shiver
I know together we deliver

Let the gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill
Who can justify the truth, God, I love you still

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins, and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know

Don't let him get too close to you
You've got a stranger on your mind
The dream is free
I know I'm only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye

Mahabang pasakalye
Aasa lang pala ako sayo

[Verse 3: Adda]
Ikaw naman ay akin ding sasagutin
Kaso nagugulumihanan pa rin
Sana magantay ka pa rin hanggang sa huli
Wag na wag kang magsasawa please
Hindi ako paasa tulad ng iba
Kaya please lang wag mo akong igaya sa kanila
Promise ko na worth it every effort you give
Kaya sana naman wag ka ng mangamba

422,Building A Mystery,"[Verse 1]
You come out at night
That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
You strut your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith
That died before Jesus came
You're building a mystery

[Verse 2]
You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
You wear sandals in the snow
And a smile that won't wash away
Can you look out the window
Without your shadow getting in the way?
Oh you're so beautiful
With an edge and a charm
But so careful
When I'm in your arms

[Chorus]
'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

[Verse 3]
You woke up screaming aloud
A prayer from your secret god
You feed off our fears
And hold back your tears
Oh, give us a tantrum
And a know it all grin
Just when we need one
When the evening's thin

[Bridge]
You're so beautiful
A beautiful fucked up man
You're setting up your
Razor wire shrine

[Chorus]
'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully
Ooh, you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully",Sarah McLachlan,1998,"[47, 41, 39, 43, 39]",5
423,Mourn You Til I Join You,"[Intro: 2Pac]
It's gonna be alright, you gotta believe dat

[Verse 1: Treach]
Dear God times are changing and the weather got hot
Over the past year a lot of niggas went pop drop
So I thank you for my life and all that I got
I wanna praise you and drop off a message to Pac
I was sittin' here lookin' at your picture my nigga
Puttin' hash with the weed wit a mixture of liqour
We can't kick it you ain't wit us is the shit I can't figure
Nigga I miss ya this thug gonna miss ya till I'm wit cha'
It was 90 on the P.E. tour when we mashed down
Don't even seem like 7 years passed
Both rodies now homies out the hood on the scene
You did the humpty with D.U. I did the walk with the queen
Was a dream smokin' and drinkin' through our per diem
Stealin' backstage passes to hit ho's and coliseums
Found hoes to flip up make them lift they shit up
Get it then get up looking to chicks up and switch up
Think of all the times that I rolled wit mine
Male groupies got dissed and got the hell out of dodge
They was blinded when the good shined through they were on you
Just know I'm gon' mourn you till I join you

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

[Verse 2: Treach]
We was two lil niggas both skinny and broke
Happy if we scrap pennies for smokes
Tours over we were out yeah and you called with the news
You was over in New York to film this movie called Juice
Called you back up you told me pack up
Me and you and Stretch could shack up
The thug luv back up the act up
Shock, Hakeem and  ain't true would call and fuss cause they know we all kicked up dust
You remember when the cabby said daddy wouldn't pick up our RACE
You beat his ass then you spit in his face
I remember on the set from the trailer fiends stole your jewels
And Big Stretch punched him out his shoes
Back then I was taking stashes quick who holdin'
That's when every piece of bud I was rolling was stolen
We would laugh at the jacks over six-packs and yacks
Spit the emos over demos thinkin' ladies and limos
Youse a wild motherfucker who could never sit still
Said you wouldn't rest until you saw a mill
Nigga I felt you
We was back an' forth borough to projects for forts
Damn I wish they knew how much you loved new york
Shit and can't nobody dis my nigga
Motha fuck that I miss my nigga
I'm a mourn you till I join you

[Spoken]
You ain't got to worry about how long I'm gonna mourn ya
I'm gonna keep your name on the streets

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

[Verse 3: Treach]
I'm ya true motherfucker thug nation alert
Keep his name on the street til ya lay in the dirt
This shit hurt cause we went from poor to rich
You're supposed to see a lot more than this
They brought you up locked you up when you did above the rim
They let you out you called us up we came as thugs again
We would hear ""ah-ha rapist"" they shout
Ya'll was talking shit that ya'll didn't know a damn thang bout
You was going through your stress while your enemies laughed
Ain't never take no shit and 2Pac never took no ass
Fuck the press fuck the world life goes on when you die
Fuck the court fuck the judge and every bitch that lied
A little time ticked by, my ho and I got rocked
My lady waking me up yelling Treach, Pac got shot
Soon as I get there I find Afeni urging' me
Saying convince my baby, don't leave after surgery
So I'm looking in her eyes while they walking me through
Thinking Pac hard head what the hell I'ma do
So we kicked it as they stayed and I asked what you need
You say a pound for comin nigga and a hit of some weed
So I asked you not to go over and over god knows
You just smiled and said nigga help me get on my clothes
So we got over that, you healed up got locked
I dropped case about lights, they had you caged when I stopped
Yeah the chain remains plus you a part of my link
They fucked up by givin' you too much time to think
I remember your release and we met up in LA
At the billiard getting blazed Henny'd out with the hay
After that you blew up a made nigga platinum plus
Addicted to drama a soldier with a nation of thugs
Now we in these savage ages
Even you yourself predicted that last night in vegas
I heard gats were brandished, my nigga once again damaged
And a part of this heart right here in Venice
At the same time, you was both loved and feared
M.O.B. the fuckin' thug of the year
I'm a mourn you til I join you

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

Why you givin' up on us, like you don't know all the shit we been through?
Everything use to be right, now you be actin brand new
Thought I was your friend too
If we in it, it's gonna' take two
I be yellin' until I go blue, but I never would give up on you
And fuck everybody that's hatin', degrading they always got something to say
The wanna' see us apart, that's why they smile in your face
Tatted your name on my heart, that way it never would fade
Even when loving get hard, you somebody I never would trade
You're somebody I'll never forget, cause' with you all my feelings legit
These oth-er couples ain't on shit, No one else in my heart is gon' fit
I want you to be there when I'm rich
And I know that I act like a Bitch
But, you should just make me yo' miss
If we fall, we just taking a risk

Don't tell me that you love me if you don't (you don't)
I just wanna' be by your side

We go up and down, we go up and down (up And down)

[Verse 2]
Why you be getting mad at me, like being committed is easy to do?
Niggas be all on my heels, but they ain't got nothing on you
These bitches be lovin' the crew, but I never be frontin' on you
Kept it real, and the feelings is true
Im attached like im laying in glue
You say that you love me, so if that is true, we gon' have to make it official
You be blowin' me like I'm a whistle
But, I better come first like initials
Cause' I been your girl from the start
Even would bitches would tear us apart
Took me a chance and I put down my guards, now you the only nigga' with my heart
And I could put that on my soul
I can see me with you, when I'm old
If I wanna escape, would you roll?
If I was falling apart, would you hold?
I'm done overthinking, will it really last I a never know
But, he see through me like a microscope, and  here for em
Just to let him know, that I feel em'

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take, every move I make

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks

Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

So look out and hide your fans
I'm a woman on fire
With huge desire
To be as good as any man

So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

[Chorus]
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

[Verse 2]
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, ""Hey, I love you,""
Never again
To be all alone

[Chorus] x2

[Outro]
It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life",Debby Boone,1998,"[82, 64, 48, 51]",4
434,Rhythm Of Love,"[Spoken Intro]
You know, this old world
It just keeps on spinning around and around and around
And sometimes it just spins too fast
And you, you not only lose your balance
But you lose your rhythm
And it's at times like these that you just need to stop
And not only find your way again but find your own rhythm
Because life has a rhythm
And Mother Nature has a rhythm
And love...oh yes, love has a rhythm

[Verse 1]
Can't you come away, away tonight and talk to me?
Far away from all the world's insanity
Fill your heart with music tonight
Satisfy your soul and ease your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Open your arms, close your eyes
Hearts will harmonize
Making music in your arms
Never before, never anymore
Will you be alone
Now that you have known...

[Chorus]
My rhythm of love, baby
Rhythm of love
Rhythm of love, darling
The rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
Hold me closer now
Times are troubled, there's no doubt
Where's the cure in times like these?
The rhythm of love is the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Open your arms, close your eyes
Hearts will harmonize
Making music in your arms
I'll never leave anyone, a fool could see
We have all we need, as long as we believe

[Chorus]
The rhythm of love, baby
The rhythm of love
Rhythm of love, darling
The rhythm of love

[Bridge]
Oh Lord, where would I go?
Oh, without you here to love me, baby?
Oh Lord, what would I do?
Oh, without you here to love me, ahh yeah
I can't stop it
I don't want to stop it
Darling, oh no, no, no

Oh, you must live by the rhythm
Oh, you, you must love by the rhythm
Oh, you must live by the rhythm
Oh, you must love by the rhythm, yeah yeah yeah",Anita Baker,1998,"[96, 96]",2

Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, and Cupid
I'm a get stupid, ha ha ha, eh
I sat around all night under the chimney
Holdin my sack like ""gimme gimme""
I know that he's commin, he's commin he must
Lookin up nuthin but rust, dust
Turn on my tv the very next day I see your gettin payed
Leadin the parade I'm that sniper on the buildin
Listen to my nine go click, Santas a fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch

Another year and I ain't get shit
(Another year I ain't get shit)
If I hear him land on my roof
(Ohh my undertaker)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

Yeah I got somthin to say about St. Nick
Fuck that ho, he never brought Shaggs shit
No toys, candy canes, just a lump of coal
So I eat it, cuz there ain't nuttin in the cupboards
So I'll be quick, quick and brief
Alls I need for Christmas is my two front teeth
I got mine kicked, kicked out my mouth
I need a few new ones could you help me out?
Should've known I'd get the short end of the stick
No kind of gift I didn't get shit
Some say I was bad but that wasn't it
It's all because, Santa's a fat bitch

""Oh-ho-ho don't go that way Rudolph! That's the ghetto!
Ho-ho, those boys and girls don't deserve anything.""

Santa Claus, Santa Claus where you been?
I see you got cookies and milk on your chin
I guess you had time to collect your ends
You always been down for your rich friends
But Rudolph, he don't bring his sleigh my way
Nothing but coal and dirt for little J
I guess you couldn't fit down my chimney shaft
You need to lose some of that fat ass, eh
All the little rich boys they gettin paid
Counting the toys and ducats they made
Me? I got a little half little chunk of dog shit
I'm a kill that fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch

Another year and I ain't get shit
(Mrs. Claus is a ho)
If I hear him land on my roof
(Slice that bitch in the big red coat)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

T'was the night before Christmas and everythings whack
Not a creature stirring but a fucking rat
I ain't hearin jingle bells I ain't hearin nuttin
Ain't smelling no turky sure as hell ain't no stuffing
All that I paid, wished and prayed
That fat motherfucker would swing my way
And drop off soldiers and rubber balls
But I woke up and found some crusty old drawers
Yep, yep I knew it! The shaft again, and again, and again, and again
Every year I wake up to the same old shit... house empty
No sign of the fat bitch!

Santa Claus is a fat bitch

436,All Of My Days,"Well I have been searching all of my days
All of my days
Many a road, you know
I've been walking on
All of my days
And I've been trying to find
What's been in my mind
As the days keep turning into night

Well, I have been quietly standing in the shade
All of my days
Watch the sky breaking on the promise that we made
All of this rain
And I've been trying to find
What's been in my mind
As the days keep turning into night

Well, many a night I found myself with no friends standing near
All of my days
I cried aloud
I shook my hands
What am I doing here?
All of these days
For I look around me
And my eyes confound me
And it's just too bright
As the days keep turning into night

Now, I see clearly
It's you I'm looking for
All of my days
Soon I'll smile
I know I'll feel this loneliness no more
All of my days
For I look around me
And it seems He found me
And it's coming into sight
As the days keep turning into night
As the days keep turning into night

Yes, even breathing feels all right
Now even breathing feels all right
It's even breathing
Feels all right",Alexi Murdoch,1998,"[99, 98, 94, 90]",4

438,Invisible Man,"[Refren]
I choć strój jest nieistotny (nie, nie, nie, nie, nie)
A mój aż świeci w oczy (się wie)
Ale stawiam ciche kroki (przed siebie)
Przez to jestem niewidoczny
Invisible man, Invisible man
Invisible, invisible, invisible man

[Zwrotka 1]
Znowu w garści trzymam prochy
I jebie mnie gdzie inni idą
Psy chcą zwęszyć nasze tropy
A ja mam oczy dookoła głowy
No i ciągle tylko smażę topy
Bo te copsy za mgłą mnie nie widzą
A ty nadal tylko walisz w nos, ty
Coś ty? W końcu będziesz inwalidą
I wiem, że moje ziomy zgarną hajs
Bo zgarną go nawet z przed nosa żydom
Wiem, że nie było nigdy łatwo nam
Bo łatwo stać, trudniej żyć przed siebie idąc
Moje ziomy to mój rap i to mój hype
Od publiki nie chcę braw, ty dawaj hajs
I choć jeszcze mnie nie znasz to będziesz znać
Żabson, wiem, że dosięgnę gwiazd

[Refren]
I choć strój jest nieistotny (nie, nie, nie, nie, nie)

Invisible, invisible, invisible man

[Zwrotka 2]
Wszechstronnym artystą nie jestem, to po pierwsze
Nie wiem czy umiem coś jeszcze, może zobaczyć na mieście
Moją małą impresję, czytaj kilka tagów
Ale mam słabą kreskę jak twój typ od dragów
I pieprzę tych, których cieszy nieszczęście
I wiem, że ciągle bawię się w najlepsze
Dni dzisiejsze są lepsze
Są dużo lepsze niż wczorajsze sny
I nie zdzierżę ich min
I nie wejdę w ich film
I nie będę ich czcił
A ty rzędem, idź giń
Ja nie będę tym kimś
Bo internet ci zrył
Ja ze swym bandem sweet dreams
Gdzie beze mnie byś był
I nie przejdę obojętnie obok tego co piękne
I tak stanę pewnie obok tego co szpetne
I choć mam prezencję, i ego wielkie
To co dla mnie najważniejsze to po prostu myśl

[Refren]
I choć strój jest nieistotny (nie, nie, nie, nie, nie)
A mój aż świeci w oczy (się wie)

Mase and Brian McKnight
(C'mon) Bad Boy
We don't stop
(We rock, we rock, yo)
Yo

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
I hit you with the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gate playing 2.8
Real studded jewel funded
Got to love it
First rap cat with the R&B budget
Every day on the TV me and PD
Girl's so pretty, make their man break the CD
Why y'all forever rowdy
I be out here somewhere in Maui
Till I go back to Cali

[Verse 1: Brian McKnight]
Can't understand
How he can treat you the way that he does
Give me the chance to show you, baby
You're better off with me

[Pre-Chorus: Brian McKnight, (Kelly Price)]
(Ohh ohh ohh, so will you let me try)
(I wanna make you smile)
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
(I'll never let you down)
(I'll always be around)
And you should be mine

((Don't waste your time))
(Don't waste your time)
Don't baby
((If he don't treat you like he should))
No, baby
((Then you should be mine))
You should be mine, baby

[Verse 2: Brian McKnight]
Why can't you see
You should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you
For the rest of your life

Yo!
What the deal, honey?
Insecure feel funny
I know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money
Plus I know you're like Ma$e in a lot of ways
But it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays
When you shopping
Did you shop for 2?
Uh!
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back
Treat you like you're all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat

You ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night
Just to save a fight
Or say he's right
And I know he ain't the cat that'll stay in you life
Even though he gave you ice now make'm your wife (yeah)
How a man deserve you if he hurt you?
Then he give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you
You ain't heard that from me
Cuz Ma$e ain't the player with the PhD

440,I Miss My Homies,"[Intro]
I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood
'Til all this black on black crime stop
Some say the blind lead the blind
But in the ghetto you never know when it's gon' be yo time

[Chorus: Sons of Funk, Mo B. Dick, O'dell]
Sitting in the ghetto thinkin' 'bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted Cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
And I really miss my homies
Even though you're gone away
I know you're in a better place
And I hope to see you soon someday

[Verse 1: Master P]
I used to hang with my boy, even slang with my boy
I used to bang with my boy, goddamn I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin' birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin', I be perkin', never jerkin'
Still blowin' dolja fo' ya 'cause I know you're up there workin'
Your little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see your t-shirts with your face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend, on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin' in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name, leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost their loved ones to these ghetto scandals

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)
Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli, Biggie Smalls)
All my homies who done made it to the crossroads

[Chorus: Sons of Funk, Mo B. Dick, O'dell]
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
(It's like I can't believe you gone)
My best friend's gone
(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on)
And I'm so all alone
(Everytime I see something you done left)
I really miss my homies
(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)
Even though they gone away
(I just keep reminiscin')
I know you in a better place
('Cause I know you alright)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(And I keep smilin', knowin' I'm a see you in the crossroads)

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin' weed 'til 3, hollerin' at the hoes
Spendin' $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, ""C, leave that dope, 'cause rappin' is yo thang""
I ain't gon' even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin' why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin' ki's
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

[Chorus: Sons of Funk, Mo B. Dick, O'dell]
Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon' be forgotten)
I know you in a better place
('Cause as long as I'm here
You gon' live through me and other TRU playas)
I really miss my homies
Even though they're gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Verse 4: Silkk the Shocker]
I'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' about all the times we had
Thinkin' about the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante? It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin' I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin' girls, writin' down numbers like memos
Makin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile
See you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and P and C forever gon be ridin' and thuggin'
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon' miss you

[Outro]
(I love these fools)
I know you in a better place
(Every time I get on my knees)
And I hope to see ya soon someday

I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin'
Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)",Master P,1998,"[79, 69, 61]",3

Gettin' paper every day, it's all I'm trippin' on
'Cause ain't nothin' like a rag in Californ-i-a
With the top back, rollin' on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin' all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies
And mashi'n to the backyard boogie

[Ice Cube]
Get yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]

Chorus:

And then we comin' wit that
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's all about that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (unh)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's the backyard boogie) [repeat 3X]
Backyard boogie oogie oogie [repeat 2X]

Verse Two:
Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin' where you from cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
Been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggas in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin' they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin' loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin' back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The Bloods shootin' dice, and the Crips are C-walkin
Now the party is jumpin', and the crowd's gettin' bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin' and humpin'
'Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin'

(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
And we comin with that)

Chorus

Verse Three

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
Ain't nothin' but real niggas, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
And Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang
You choose or you lose while you conversatin'
Enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin'
I want homegirl over there in red
Cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a ho
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
'Cause she gonna leave a backyard boogie with me

[Ice Cube]
(Get yo' boogie on, yeah
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on)

Outro-Chorus

Straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
Mackness, mackness, unh!
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, nigga get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on baby, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on
Gangstas don't dance we boogie
Niggas run out and get yo' cookies
Gangstas don't dance we boogie
Mack 10 ain't no motherfucker rookie
Backyard boogie oogie oofie [repeat 8X]",Mack 10,1998,"[67, 68]",2
445,Around The World,"[Verse 1]
All around the world, we could make time
Rompin' and a-stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said ""Hallelujah""
Good God, girl, I wish I knew ya

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say ""Hello"" and then I say ""Adieu""

[Verse 2]
Come back, baby, 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love, pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride, step aside, Mike Johnson
Yes, I could, in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say ""Hello"" and then I say ""Adieu""

[Verse 3]
Where you want to go, who you want to be
What you want to do, just come with me
I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me, girl, sittin' in the Swiss mountains
Me Oh My O, me and Guy O
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rocking Ohio
Around the world, I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang
I know, I know it's you
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang
Mother Russia, do not suffer, I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world and I have seen your love
I know, I know it's you
You say ""Hello"" and then I say ""Adieu""

446,Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer,"Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
She'd been drinkin' too much egg nog
And we'd begged her not to go
But she'd left her medication
So she stumbled out the door into the snow
When they found her Christmas mornin'
At the scene of the attack
There were hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
Now were all so proud of Grandpa
He's been takin' this so well
See him in there watchin' football
Drinkin' beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of pig
And a blue and silver candle
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig
I've warned all my friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walkin' home from our house, Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe!",Home Free,1998,[87],1

You have the time

448,I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying,"[Verse 1]
Seven weeks have passed now since she left me
She shows her face to ask me how I am
She says the kids are fine, that they miss me
Maybe I could come and baby-sit sometime
She says, ""Are you O.K.? I was worried about you
Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy."" I said

[Chorus]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears

[Verse 2]
I saw a friend of mine
He said, ""I was worried about you
I heard she had another man
I wondered how you felt about it?"" I said

[Chorus]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears

[Verse 3]
Saw my lawyer, Mr Good News
He got me joint custody and legal separation

[Chorus 2]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears

[Verse 4]
I took a walk alone last night
I looked up at the stars
To try and find an answer in my life
I chose a star for me
I chose a star for him
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
Something made me smile
Something seemed to ease the pain
Something about the universe and how it's all connected

[Verse 5]
The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream
We try to do the best within the given time
A kid should be with his mother
Everybody knows that
What can a father do but baby-sit sometimes?

[Outro]
I saw that friend of mine, he said
""You look different somehow""
I said, ""Everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime""

[Chorus 2]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears",Sting,1998,[95],1
