Looked em dead in the eyes and said

She's got a pad down at 34th and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion #9

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm
And she made a magic sign
She said
""Whatcha need is
A bottle of Love Potion #9""

And gave me a wink
She said I'm gonna make it up
Right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine
And looked like India ink

I closed my eyes
I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissing everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop
Down at 34th and Vine
He broke my little bottle of
Love Potion #9

And gave me a wink

36,Walking In The Rain,"Sitting by the window
Singing songs of love
Wishing you were here
Because the memory's not enough
Wear my mask in silence
Pretending I'm alright
If you could see then you would be
Here standing by my side

It may be hard to believe
But girl you're the only one I need
It may be hard along the way
It's this feeling I get
When blue skies turn to grey

Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter
'Cause I'm fading away
And baby, I'm walking in the rain

Every single hour
Of every single day
I need to cry, my eyes are dry
I've cried my tears away
Can't help but remember
How you made me feel
You dressed my soul and made me whole
You made my life complete

It may be hard to believe
But girl you're the only one I need
It may be hard along the way
It's this feeling I get
When blue skies turn to grey

Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter
'Cause I'm fading away
And baby, I'm walking in the rain

Of all we've said and done
Remains the memories of days
When life was fun
But now when you are gone
I sit alone to watch the setting of the sun

Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter

How you gonna hate on me?
These sticks, these stones be with my bones
I swear I'll burn this motherfucker to the ground
[?] to turn your back on me
Fucking with a wild, wild one

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm captivatin' the bitches, gold flow in my veins
In my Yeezy Adidas and I'm still running from fame
A lot of men to recover, a lot of money to gain
Double M in this bitch, like Troy Ave I'ma bang
Double park my Carrera, ever step, that's an error
Go to war for dinero, you better get on my level
He lost his crib to the bank, while I'm swimming in dank
Lessons learned in life, nigga you give or you take
She swallowed me on the first, still a hundred a verse
That boy shells in the heat cause my last season was the worst
Pat Riley of rap, all my niggas got rings
Or at least a Ferrari, they need police on the scene

I gave my life, my heart, my soul to you motherfuckers
How you gonna hate on me?

I swear I'll burn this motherfucker to the ground

Fucking with a wild, wild one

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I did it for the streets with my mama in mind
I had sex with a twin, had the other one crying
Our time is divine, I recline or retire
I ain't tired of the grind, I'm just tired of you lying
Told my bitch ""I got your back,"" tat my name on her spine
Got my hand on her ass, Givenchy's on the gas
Got semis in the dash, I got a van full of ballers like a soccer dad
I just had to laugh
1-50 in reverse and I know not to crash
If I roll my own joints, then I'm not gon' pass
I'm getting more paper, I need to get me more haters
I got things bling and this flavor, got this shit looking like Vegas

[Chorus: MeetSims]
I gave my life, my heart, my soul to you motherfuckers
How you gonna hate on me?

I swear I'll burn this motherfucker to the ground

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
How you feel? I don't give a fuck
Love to tell a bitch nigga no
Pussy nigga get it out the mud
Multi-platinum, think I'm going gold
Phone ringin', put 'em on hold
Grinding, tryna keep it in road
Deal with shit that you'll never know
By the rules, sticking to the code
Fast cars, status in the game
Got a reputation with the name
Passed the lane, I just want the change
Rappers lame, niggas want the fame
Get out of the way, bitches say I changed
Love the Range, that'll probly change
Run upon me when you think I am slipping
Big shit gripper, I ain't timid
Brinks bricks break'em real simple
You would think I'm talking recompressed
Big bitch always giving mention
Feel a way to get it off your chest
G Shock watch tell the time
These blocks over here is mine
Crap in the barrel ass nigga
Grab at ya while you tryna climb

[Chorus: MeetSims]
I gave my life, my heart, my soul to you motherfuckers

39,Downtown,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I went to the moped store, said ""Fuck it""
And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe (Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace (Downtown)

[Verse 4: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Dope
Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow
You can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now

Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love

I just wanna see you smile through all the hate

Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is

I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is

What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Please tell me)

There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Somebody tell me)
What now?

Tut mir leid wenn ich den Untertanenstolz jetzt verletze
Doch was quatscht ihr da, es gibt nicht genug Ausbeutungsplätze
Ihr wollt Kapitalismus mit Herz?
Fick mich, aber nicht im Etap Hotel
Sondern richtig schön mit Essen gehen
Und am nächsten Morgen noch Taxigeld
Vor der Glotze, sauer auf die scheiß Sozialschmarotzer
Anstatt auf den Chef, der mit dem Geld aus eurer Arbeit
Seiner Tochter noch 'nen Lamborghini kauft
Alter, dann verdient ihr's auch
Doch ich versteh, ihr regt euch lieber über Brangelina auf
Für's Gewissen 10 Euro spenden
Dann kommen die hoffentlich nicht über die Grenzen
Und holen sich alles zurück, vielleicht lieber doch die Waffenlieferung canceln, fleißig wie ihr seid
Habt ihr doch die Sterbeurkunde schon vom Amt geholt

You down to your knees that

50,Hawaii Tattoo,"[Voice Sample]
Ich will dir sagen, wie sehr du mich bewegt hast
Und verändert hast
Wenn du mir etwas versprechen willst, versprich mir eins:
Versuche dich mit meinen Augen zu seh'n!
Du warst mein Leben, Holly
Aber ich bin in deinem Leben nur ein Kapitel
Und jetzt kommt es... das Entscheidende:
P.S.: Ich werde dich immer lieben

[Part 1]
Ich kann mich gut erinnern, als ich dich zum Flieger brachte
Und als Du weg warst für dich fünf oder sechs Lieder machte
Und es geht schnell vorbei, ich sagte man ich warte drauf
Und hab mir direkt einfach 'nen 400 Gras gekauft
Und ich bereue vieles, doch ich war nicht klein zu kriegen
Ich wollte sparen, um für Dich mal nach Hawaii zu fliegen
Wenn du das hörst, würdest du gerne in mein Face spucken
Ich weiß du denkst an mich, würdest du 50 Erste Dates gucken
Mein größter Traum war es, mit dir in eine Wohnung zieh'n
Und jetzt sitz' ich da und geh' 'nen Dübel in der Wohnung zieh'n
Ich wollte dir sagen es war schön auf unser'm Magic Ban
Da war Ich mir sicher: Ich beschütz dich mit ner Getlingun
Ich wär nie weggerannt, wenn was gewesen wär
Sie war die Richtige ganz sicher es ist eben schwer
Zu akzeptier'n: Es hört alles mit 'nem Ende auf
Wenn ich an dich denke man krieg ich eine Gänsehaut

[Hook]
Für dich bin ich tot im Himmel, im Ernst, Alter ohne Mist
Ich weiß, dass es mittlerweile komisch is', so ohne dich
Ich hab' mich drauf eingelassen und ich geh' jetzt einen Paffen
Auch wenn es nie wieder kommt, ich fange an Hawaii zu hassen
Für dich bin ich tot im Himmel, im Ernst, Alter ohne Mist
Ich weiß, dass es mittlerweile komisch is', so ohne dich
Kannst du mich hier leiden sehen? Ich fang' an mir einzureden:
Alles wäre anders, mann, wärst du nie auf Hawaii gewesen


[Part 2]
Du wolltest ein Tattoo und keine Strophen haben
Jetzt willst du dein Leben leben, doch ich muss so viel sagen
Ich bin so froh: Durch dich hatte ich einen roten Faden
In meinem Leben, ey ich muss Dir einfach so viel sagen
Du warst mein Leben und ich deins und ja das weißt du
Ich lass diesen Scheiß zu: Neid, Wut, beiß' zu
Eh, ich hab ne Ausbildung um was zu lernen
Wo ist die Sicherheit denn hin, dass wir das schaffen werden?
Ich hätte ""R&M"" verliebt an jede Wand gepinselt
Ich habe dich angehimmelt und du hast mich angehimmelt
Ich wär bestimmt nicht hier
Ich würde das nie schreiben, hättest du mich nicht so inspiriert, dann wär ich nicht so deprimiert
Mit einer rosa Brille wollten wir schon Pläne machen ich würde mich auf ewig hassen, würde ich dich so gehen lassen
Und falls du weg bist und man sich nie mehr wieder
Sieht dann höre ich dieses Lied und weiß das es die Liebe gibt

[Hook]

[Part 3]
Und ich weiß: Ich muss das locker sehen
Doch anstatt ein Mann zu sein, blieb ich einfach stotternd steh'n
Ich kann mich ja doch verstehen, warum lass ich mir von dieser Frau immer den Kopf verdreh'n?
Ich muss mir das Ott da nehm'
Sorry! Es tut mir Leid, ey vielleicht nerv' ich dich
Für mich war es sicherlich kein erster Fick bei Kerzenlicht
Es war halt zu perfekt, vielleicht sahst du zwar glücklich aus
Und dachtest so wie ich es ist zwar schön, aber erdrückt dich auch
Ich will nicht daran denken, doch diese verliebten Augen
Machen es schwer und ich kann nichts, außer das Weed zu rauchen
Ich schrieb dir Tausend Songs, keiner davon aufgenommen
Direkt wieder gelöscht, ich nehm' die graue Bong und lauf davon
Keiner davon gut genug, keiner davon tut mir gut
Ich will dass du das hier findest, wenn du Kuchen auf Youtube suchst
Eh Ich trau mir selber diesen Mut nie zu, es kommen andere, doch keine wird so gut wie du

I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

When shadows fall, I passed a small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
Oh, how can I forget you?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa

If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just come back to the places where we used to go, and I'll be there
Oh, how can I forget you?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you, and I will never be free

53,Promised Land,"[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh
And on across Caroline
We stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
We never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling outta the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Riding across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh, when the pilot told me us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten o nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line",Chuck Berry,1964,"[55, 65, 89]",3
54,Without The One You Love (Life's Not Worth While),"O, Wellington! (or 'Villainton'—for Fame
Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;
France could not even conquer your great name,
But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase—
Beating or beaten she will laugh the same),
You have obtain'd great pensions and much praise:
Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,
Humanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'

I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well
In Marinet's affair—in fact, 't was shabby,
And like some other things won't do to tell
Upon your tomb in Westminster's old abbey.
Upon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,
Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;
But though your years as man tend fast to zero,
In fact your grace is still but a young hero.

Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,
Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:
You have repair'd Legitimacy's crutch,
A prop not quite so certain as before:
The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,
Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;
And Waterloo has made the world your debtor
(I wish your bards would sing it rather better).

You are 'the best of cut-throats:'—do not start;
The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:
War 's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,
Unless her cause by right be sanctified.
If you have acted once a generous part,
The world, not the world's masters, will decide,
And I shall be delighted to learn who,
Save you and yours, have gain'd by Waterloo?

I am no flatterer—you 've supp'd full of flattery:
They say you like it too—'t is no great wonder.
He whose whole life has been assault and battery,
At last may get a little tired of thunder;
And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he
May like being praised for every lucky blunder,
Call'd 'Saviour of the Nations'—not yet saved,
And 'Europe's Liberator'—still enslaved.

I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate
Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,
And send the sentinel before your gate
A slice or two from your luxurious meals:
He fought, but has not fed so well of late.
Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:—
There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,
But pray give back a little to the nation.

I don't mean to reflect—a man so great as
You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:
The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,
With modern history has but small connection:
Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,
You need not take them under your direction;
And half a million for your Sabine farm
Is rather dear!—I 'm sure I mean no harm.

Great men have always scorn'd great recompenses:
Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,
Not leaving even his funeral expenses:
George Washington had thanks and nought beside,
Except the all-cloudless glory which few men's is
To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,
And as a high-soul'd minister of state is
Renown'd for ruining Great Britain gratis.

Never had mortal man such opportunity,
Except Napoleon, or abused it more:
You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity
Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:
And now—what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?
Now—that the rabble's first vain shouts are o'er?
Go! hear it in your famish'd country's cries!
Behold the world! and curse your victories!

As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,
To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe
Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,
But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe
Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,
Must be recited, and—without a bribe.
You did great things; but not being great in mind,
Have left undone the greatest—and mankind.

Death laughs—Go ponder o'er the skeleton
With which men image out the unknown thing
That hides the past world, like to a set sun
Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring—
Death laughs at all you weep for:—look upon
This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting
Turns life to terror, even though in its sheath:
Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!

Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!
And yet was what you are: from ear to ear
It laughs not—there is now no fleshy bar
So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,
But still he smiles; and whether near or far,
He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,
White, black, or copper—the dead bones will grin.

And thus Death laughs,—it is sad merriment,
But still it is so; and with such example
Why should not Life be equally content
With his superior, in a smile to trample
Upon the nothings which are daily spent
Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample
Than the eternal deluge, which devours
Suns as rays—worlds like atoms—years like hours?

'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'
Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.
I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,
Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;
But would much rather have a sound digestion
Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on
Through fifty victories to shame or fame—
Without a stomach what were a good name?

'O dura ilia messorum!'—'Oh
Ye rigid guts of reapers!' I translate
For the great benefit of those who know
What indigestion is—that inward fate
Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.
A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:
Let this one toil for bread—that rack for rent,
He who sleeps best may be the most content.

'To be, or not to be?'—Ere I decide,
I should be glad to know that which is being?
'T is true we speculate both far and wide,
And deem, because we see, we are all-seeing:
For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,
Until I see both sides for once agreeing.
For me, I sometimes think that life is death,
Rather than life a mere affair of breath.

'Que scais-je?' was the motto of Montaigne,
As also of the first academicians:
That all is dubious which man may attain,
Was one of their most favourite positions.
There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain
As any of Mortality's conditions;
So little do we know what we 're about in
This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.

It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,
Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;
But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?
Your wise men don't know much of navigation;
And swimming long in the abyss of thought
Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station
Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers
Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.

'But heaven,' as Cassio says, 'is above all—
No more of this, then,—let us pray!' We have
Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,
Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,
Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall
Is special providence,' though how it gave
Offence, we know not; probably it perch'd
Upon the tree which Eve so fondly search'd.

O, ye immortal gods! what is theogony?
O, thou too, mortal man! what is philanthropy?
O, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?
Some people have accused me of misanthropy;
And yet I know no more than the mahogany
That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy
I comprehend, for without transformation
Men become wolves on any slight occasion.

But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er
Done anything exceedingly unkind,—
And (though I could not now and then forbear
Following the bent of body or of mind)
Have always had a tendency to spare,—
Why do they call me misanthrope? Because
They hate me, not I them.—and here we 'll pause.

'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,—
For I maintain that it is really good,
Not only in the body but the proem,
However little both are understood
Just now,—but by and by the Truth will show 'em
Herself in her sublimest attitude:
And till she doth, I fain must be content
To share her beauty and her banishment.

Our hero (and, I trust, kind reader, yours)
Was left upon his way to the chief city
Of the immortal Peter's polish'd boors
Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.
I know its mighty empire now allures
Much flattery—even Voltaire's, and that 's a pity.
For me, I deem an absolute autocrat
Not a barbarian, but much worse than that.

And I will war, at least in words (and—should
My chance so happen—deeds), with all who war
With Thought;—and of Thought's foes by far most rude,
Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.
I know not who may conquer: if I could
Have such a prescience, it should be no bar
To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation
Of every depotism in every nation.

It is not that I adulate the people:
Without me, there are demagogues enough,
And infidels, to pull down every steeple,
And set up in their stead some proper stuff.
Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,
As is the Christian dogma rather rough,
I do not know;—I wish men to be free
As much from mobs as kings—from you as me.

The consequence is, being of no party,
I shall offend all parties: never mind!
My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty
Than if I sought to sail before the wind.
He who has nought to gain can have small art: he
Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,
May still expatiate freely, as will I,
Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.

That 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;—
I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl
By night, as do that mercenary pack all,
Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,
And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
However, the poor jackals are less foul
(As being the brave lions' keen providers)
Than human insects, catering for spiders.

Raise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,
And without that, their poison and their claws
Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say
(Or rather peoples)—go on without pause!
The web of these tarantulas each day
Increases, till you shall make common cause:
None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,
As yet are strongly stinging to be free.

Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,
Was left upon his way with the despatch,
Where blood was talk'd of as we would of water;
And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch
O'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter
Fair Catherine's pastime—who look'd on the match
Between these nations as a main of cocks,
Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.

And there in a kibitka he roll'd on
(A cursed sort of carriage without springs,
Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),
Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,
And orders, and on all that he had done—
And wishing that post-horses had the wings
Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises
Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.

At every jolt—and they were many—still
He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,
As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill
Than he, in these sad highways left at large
To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,
Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge
On her canals, where God takes sea and land,
Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.

At least he pays no rent, and has best right
To be the first of what we used to call
'Gentlemen farmer'—a race worn out quite,
Since lately there have been no rents at all,
And 'gentlemen' are in a piteous plight,
And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:
She fell with Buonaparte—What strange thoughts
Arise, when we see emperors fall with oats!

But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child
Whom he had saved from slaughter—what a trophy
O! ye who build up monuments, defiled
With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,
Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,
And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee
To soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!
Because he could no more digest his dinner;—

O ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,
That one life saved, especially if young
Or pretty, is a thing to recollect
Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung
From the manure of human clay, though deck'd
With all the praises ever said or sung:
Though hymn'd by every harp, unless within
Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.

O! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!
Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!
Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!
Whether you 're paid by government in bribes,
To prove the public debt is not consuming us—
Or, roughly treading on the 'courtier's kibes'
With clownish heel, your popular circulation
Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;—

O, ye great authors!—'Apropos des bottes,'-
I have forgotten what I meant to say,
As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;
'T was something calculated to allay
All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:
Certes it would have been but thrown away,
And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,
Although no doubt it was beyond all price.

But let it go:—it will one day be found
With other relics of 'a former world,'
When this world shall be former, underground,
Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,
Baked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,
Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd
First out of, and then back again to chaos,
The superstratum which will overlay us.

So Cuvier says;—and then shall come again
Unto the new creation, rising out
From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain
Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:
Like to the notions we now entertain
Of Titans, giants, fellows of about
Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,
And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.

Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!
How the new worldlings of the then new East
Will wonder where such animals could sup!
(For they themselves will be but of the least:
Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,
And every new creation hath decreased
In size, from overworking the material—
Men are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)

How will—to these young people, just thrust out
From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,
And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,
And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,
Till all the arts at length are brought about,
Especially of war and taxing,—how,
I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,
Look like the monsters of a new museum?

But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:
'The time is out of joint,'—and so am I;
I quite forget this poem 's merely quizzical,
And deviate into matters rather dry.
I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal
Much too poetical: men should know why
They write, and for what end; but, note or text,
I never know the word which will come next.

So on I ramble, now and then narrating,
Now pondering:—it is time we should narrate.
I left Don Juan with his horses baiting—
Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.
I shall not be particular in stating
His journey, we 've so many tours of late:
Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose
That pleasant capital of painted snows;

Suppose him in a handsome uniform,—
A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,
Waving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,
Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,
And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,
Of yellow casimere we may presume,
White stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk
O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;

Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,
Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor—
That great enchanter, at whose rod's command
Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,
Seeing how Art can make her work more grand
(When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),—
Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He
Seems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:—

His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;
His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver
Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at
His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;
His bow converted into a cock'd hat;
But still so like, that Psyche were more clever
Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),
If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.

The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and
The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd—
I quite forget which of them was in hand
Just then; as they are rather numerous found,
Who took by turns that difficult command
Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:
But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,
All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.

Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,
Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless
There was a something in his turn of limb,
And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,
That though he look'd one of the seraphim,
There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.
Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,
And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.

No wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,
Or Scherbatoff, or any other off
Or on, might dread her majesty had not room enough
Within her bosom (which was not too tough)
For a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough
Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,
Of him who, in the language of his station,
Then held that 'high official situation.'

O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know
The import of this diplomatic phrase,
Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show
His parts of speech; and in the strange displays
Of that odd string of words, all in a row,
Which none divine, and every one obeys,
Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,
Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.

I think I can explain myself without
That sad inexplicable beast of prey—
That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,
Did not his deeds unriddle them each day—
That monstrous hieroglyphic—that long spout
Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!
And here I must an anecdote relate,
But luckily of no great length or weight.

An English lady ask'd of an Italian,
What were the actual and official duties
Of the strange thing some women set a value on,
Which hovers oft about some married beauties,
Called 'Cavalier servente?'—a Pygmalion
Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true 't is)
Beneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,
Said—'Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.'

And thus I supplicate your supposition,
And mildest, matron-like interpretation,
Of the imperial favourite's condition.
'T was a high place, the highest in the nation
In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion
Of any one's attaining to his station,
No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,
If rather broad, made stocks rise and their holders.

Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,
And had retain'd his boyish look beyond
The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,
With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond
Parisian aspect which upset old Troy
And founded Doctors' Commons:—I have conn'd
The history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,
Calls Ilion's the first damages on record.

And Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,
Who was gone to his place), and pass'd for much
Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)
Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch
Of sentiment; and he she most adored
Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such
A lover as had cost her many a tear,
And yet but made a middling grenadier.

O thou 'teterrima causa' of all 'belli'-
Thou gate of life and death—thou nondescript!
Whence is our exit and our entrance,—well I
May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt
In thy perennial fountain:—how man fell I
Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript
Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises
Since, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.

Some call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I
Maintain thou art the best: for after all
From thee we come, to thee we go, and why
To get at thee not batter down a wall,
Or waste a world? since no one can deny
Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:
With, or without thee, all things at a stand
Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!

Catherine, who was the grand epitome
Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what
You please (it causes all the things which be,
So you may take your choice of this or that)—
Catherine, I say, was very glad to see
The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat
Victory; and pausing as she saw him kneel
With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.

Then recollecting the whole empress, nor
forgetting quite the woman (which composed
At least three parts of this great whole), she tore
The letter open with an air which posed
The court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,
Until a royal smile at length disclosed
Fair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,
Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.

Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first
Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain.
Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,
As an East Indian sunrise on the main.
These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst—
So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:
In vain!—As fall the dews on quenchless sands,
Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!

Her next amusement was more fanciful;
She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw
Into a Russian couplet rather dull
The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.
Her third was feminine enough to annul
The shudder which runs naturally through
Our veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best
To kill, and generals turn it into jest.

The two first feelings ran their course complete,
And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:
The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,
Like flowers well water'd after a long drouth.
But when on the lieutenant at her feet
Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth
Almost as much as on a new despatch,
Glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.

Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,
When wroth—while pleased, she was as fine a figure
As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,
Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.
She could repay each amatory look you lent
With interest, and in turn was won't with rigour
To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount
At sight, nor would permit you to discount.

With her the latter, though at times convenient,
Was not so necessary; for they tell
That she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,
And always used her favourites too well.
If once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,
Your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell
A man' (as Giles says); for though she would widow all
Nations, she liked man as an individual.

What a strange thing is man? and what a stranger
Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,
And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
Is all the rest about her! Whether wed
Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her
Mind like the wind: whatever she has said
Or done, is light to what she 'll say or do;—
The oldest thing on record, and yet new!

O Catherine! (for of all interjections,
To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right
In love and war) how odd are the connections
Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!
Just now yours were cut out in different sections:
First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;
Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;
And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!

Shakspeare talks of 'the herald Mercury
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'
And some such visions cross'd her majesty,
While her young herald knelt before her still.
'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,
For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill
Smooth'd even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing
With youth and health all kisses are 'heaven-kissing.'

Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up—
And so they fell in love;—she with his face,
His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup
With the first draught intoxicates apace,
A quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'
Which makes one drunk at once, without the base
Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye
In love drinks all life's fountains (save tears) dry.

He, on the other hand, if not in love,
Fell into that no less imperious passion,
Self-love—which, when some sort of thing above
Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,
Or duchess, princess, empress, 'deigns to prove'
('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,
For one especial person out of many,
Makes us believe ourselves as good as any.

Besides, he was of that delighted age
Which makes all female ages equal—when
We don't much care with whom we may engage,
As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,
So that we can our native sun assuage
In the next ocean, which may flow just then,
To make a twilight in, just as Sol's heat is
Quench'd in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.

And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),
Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing
Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,
Because each lover look'd a sort of king,
Made up upon an amatory pattern,
A royal husband in all save the ring—
Which, being the damn'dest part of matrimony,
Seem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey.

And when you add to this, her womanhood
In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray
(The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,
Or better, as the best examples say:
Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should
Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;
And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,
Too wise to look through optics black or blue)—

Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,
Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
Her preference of a boy to men much bigger
(Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),
Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,
With other extras, which we need not mention,—
All these, or any one of these, explain
Enough to make a stripling very vain.

And that 's enough, for love is vanity,
Selfish in its beginning as its end,
Except where 't is a mere insanity,
A maddening spirit which would strive to blend
Itself with beauty's frail inanity,
On which the passion's self seems to depend:
And hence some heathenish philosophers
Make love the main spring of the universe.

Besides Platonic love, besides the love
Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving
Of faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,
That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving
'Gainst reason—Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove
With rhyme, but always leant less to improving
The sound than sense)—beside all these pretences
To love, there are those things which words name senses;

Those movements, those improvements in our bodies
Which make all bodies anxious to get out
Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,
For such all women are at first no doubt.
How beautiful that moment! and how odd is
That fever which precedes the languid rout
Of our sensations! What a curious way
The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!

The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,
To end or to begin with; the next grand
Is that which may be christen'd love canonical,
Because the clergy take the thing in hand;
The third sort to be noted in our chronicle
As flourishing in every Christian land,
Is when chaste matrons to their other ties
Add what may be call'd marriage in disguise.

Well, we won't analyse—our story must
Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,
Juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;—
I cannot stop to alter words once written,
And the two are so mix'd with human dust,
That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:
But in such matters Russia's mighty empress
Behaved no better than a common sempstress.

The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
And all lips were applied unto all ears!
The elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper
As they beheld; the younger cast some leers
On one another, and each lovely lisper
Smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears
Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye
Of all the standing army who stood by.

All the ambassadors of all the powers
Enquired, Who was this very new young man,
Who promised to be great in some few hours?
Which is full soon—though life is but a span.
Already they beheld the silver showers
Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,
Upon his cabinet, besides the presents
Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.

Catherine was generous,—all such ladies are:
Love, that great opener of the heart and all
The ways that lead there, be they near or far,
Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,—
Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,
And was not the best wife, unless we call
Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better
That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)—

Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,
Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,
If history, the grand liar, ever saith
The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,
Because she put a favourite to death,
Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.

But when the levee rose, and all was bustle
In the dissolving circle, all the nations'
Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle
Round the young man with their congratulations.
Also the softer silks were heard to rustle
Of gentle dames, among whose recreations
It is to speculate on handsome faces,
Especially when such lead to high places.

Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,
A general object of attention, made
His answers with a very graceful bow,
As if born for the ministerial trade.
Though modest, on his unembarrass'd brow
Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said
Little, but to the purpose; and his manner
Flung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.

An order from her majesty consign'd
Our young lieutenant to the genial care
Of those in office: all the world look'd kind
(As it will look sometimes with the first stare,
Which youth would not act ill to keep in mind),
As also did Miss Protasoff then there,
Named from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'
A term inexplicable to the Muse.

With her then, as in humble duty bound,
Juan retired,—and so will I, until
My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.
We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'
So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,
And all my fancies whirling like a mill;
Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,
To take a quiet ride in some green Lane.",Lord Byron,1964,"[56, 43, 45, 51, 68]",5

And stay because they feel that no other man
Wants his woman but him, but listen

If you think no other man wants her
Just throw her away and you will see
Some man will have her before you can count
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, he will

Ha, ha, listen girls, this goes for you, too
Because you know I've seen so many women
Who've had so many good men in life

Men who would stand by 'em through thick and thin
Men who would go to work everyday and bring home
Their hard earned pay
Men who would give their women anything that their
Little heart desired

Where some women make mistakes
Is when their men go out and let 'em play
They would stay because they felt that no other
Woman wanted him but her, listen

If you think that no other woman wants him
Just pitch him out in the streets and you will see
Some woman will have your man before you can count
One, two, three, yes, you will, yes, you will",Hank Williams Jr.,1964,"[59, 75]",2

That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Now picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring, yes

He's washin dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks
Thats what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year, maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

Yeah, she sits alone
Most every night
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write
He says he's busy
But she says, ""is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

Now he doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
Judge say, ""Budge, right into jail
You'd better keep her. I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee.""

Yes, yeah, you better keep her
Daddy, I think it's cheaper
Then makin' whoopee",Ella Fitzgerald,1964,"[62, 72, 85]",3
61,Seven Letters,"[Chorus: KingJet]
Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go
It's hard when enough is enough
And only you know enough is enough
But really what's a problem? A problem
A seven letter word that can go

[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
The world ain't ever cuttin' no slack
I've seen the smartest lookin' fall into the grips of a trap
But I'm illusive, been a victim of depression
But killin' myself is foolish
Though I contemplate existence, a nigga never gon' do it
I was gifted to the Earth to spread love, call me lil Cupid
Mendin' broken hearts, show them the truth, and watch them use it
I was built into perfection, been learnin', embrace your flaws
When I stand in front the mirror a nigga looking at God
That's some arrogant from the pacifist
Never been a pastor, shit
But I can move the masses like a pastor's wit
Finesse it 'til my casket dig
Rebellin' like I'm Kaepernick
Conscious captain, ask the kid
Put life into your mannequin
You man of king, I'm lightsaber dancin' like I'm young Anakin
I'm Kobe buzzer beatin' for three, fade away splashin'
Disaster, attack your life you tend to panic
I done learned to dance over the water like Michael Jackson, ay
Truth is I don't know the answers to the game
I've been readin' the instructions, the shit is fuckin' insane
So I made my own rules for the shit
There's not really many laws 'cause Karma's basically it
If you could understand, puttin' out is what you gon' get
Then you could prosper, 'cause energy remains at the end
Whenever time's up, the mind grows weary
Thinkin' of thoughts of death
But there's beauty in the thought of the power that will be left

[Chorus: KingJet]
Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go
It's hard when enough is enough
And only you know enough is enough
But really what's a problem? A problem
A seven letter word that can go

[Verse 2: AKTHESAVIOR]
Uh, lane switchin', I came up and made a difference
Had to distance all that negative energy out my system
I done witnessed people try to condition our way of living
Never givin', not at all, while I'm present to my course
Make myself into a boss, I don't follow baby I lead
So let ease, burnin' flowers, hypnotic, I'm livin' dreams
Wasn't promised but the light gave me guidance, now I achieve
Like a hyphen, how they try to divide us but now I see
We on the same team, different players, same league
But my progress ain't your progress, we ain't on the same speed
Clean my act up like a janitor, how I obtain keys
I was in the trap too, just told to set my chains free
Find a better way, no more meddling in these streets
Quick to split your melon, once gon' you tell 'em they gotta eat
Now my soul embellished when I express it up on a beat
Countin' every blessin' when I reflect on what used to be
Young AK had a vision and he never went astray
When I got rid of all the doubts is when I seen my ghosted plane
I was in a world of pain, a crowded mind, no room for gains
Then I staggered through the rain, that's when your boy became a king
It's more than entertainment, guard your brain, they try to tame it
I been ridin' solo, you get set up by the ones you hang with
Livin' for tomorrow been the motto since I was in cradle
When it's time to go I hope you get my message on the table, uh

[Chorus: KingJet]
Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go
It's hard when enough is enough
And only you know enough is enough
But really what's a problem, a problem
A seven letter word that can go

[Outro: KingJet]
Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go

Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I wonder

I just drift off to the sea, boy said I wandered
All of this light on my neck, I had to bring thunder
I told her I don't wanna do it deep down in my conscious
They wanna know why I'm all black in the middle of summer
Cause it is on me, know it is on me
But I keep that shit low-key, so she know it's not on me
I need space, all my money, put that blunt to the face
Uzi it came with the silencer just like it's playing charades
Wonder if I live forever or will I just wither away
No I don't fuck with no disrespect, nigga, catch me my fade
Wonder if I had the yah, would you be livin' the day

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder if this shit really mean anything
Sometimes I wonder if we're gonna move onto the bigger things
Sometimes I wonder if the bitch gon' get the gist of things
Sometimes I wonder, sometimes I wonder

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow

And when you come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me

And all my grave shall warmer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me",The Irish Tenors,1964,"[82, 97]",2

[Verse 1]
Here comes my guy
Walking down the street
Look how he walks
With a dancing beat (da-da-da-da-da)
Thick wavy hair (da-da-da-da-da)
A little too long
All day long he's a-singing his song

[Chorus]
And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss! Mwah!
Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there

[Bridge, spoken]
Well, what color are his eyes?
I don't know, he's always wearing shades
Is he tall?
Well, I've got to look up
Yeah? Well I hear he's bad
Mm, he's good bad, but he's not evil
(sung)
Tell me more, tell me more

[Verse 2]
Big bulky sweaters (tell me more)
To match his eyes (tell me more)
Dirty finger nails (tell me more)
Oh boy, what a prize! (tell me more)
Tight tapered pants
High button shoes
He's always looking like he's got the blues

[Chorus]
And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss! Mwah!
Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there

[Outro, spoken]
Is he a good dancer?
What do you mean is he a good dancer?
Well, how does he dance?
Close... very, very close...",The Shangri-Las,1964,[83],1
81,"Bucket ""T""","[Intro]
Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T [x3]

[Verse 1]
Found her in a barn in Tennessee
I paid five bucks for my Bucket T
Took me three years of sweat and blood
To clean off all of that Tennessee mud

[Chorus]
My Bucket T (Bucket T)
Bucket T (Bucket T)
My Bucket T (Bucket T) [x2]

[Interlude]
T T T[?] Bucket bucket bucket[?]
Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T [x2]

[Verse 2]
Cruise down the street in front of school
I wanna rev it up but I gotta be cool
Driving down the road I'll get my kicks
I'll pop in the clutch and slip in the sticks

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I was right, too, she's first in her class
There's nothing on the freeway she don't pass
All the girls want to take a ride with me
But there's only one seat in my Bucket T

82,"The Sidewinder, Part 1","I loved Grime from the first time I ever heard wunsaosen
A thousand fans with 100 pound, that's a hundred thousand
There's a lot of sick MCs in the UK, I've been around them
Got a lot of haters along the way, I just allow them

I used to get gassed when I heard Little G say ""there's only one way, and thats the G way""
Shot more tings than eBay
I was teenage but I still get gassed over that these days

And when I heard Remtrex say 'first of all, marijuana is bud, and a G is a thug""
It was over a beat that I love so now I'm like;
Blud, marijuana is ganja, and a G is a gangsta
And a wifey, that's a girl that you pamper, and if you're in the dance you're a skanker
And when I heard Hazman spray at Sidewinder, I was with a girl in the crowd with the black eyeliner
Man was minor but I used to skank get hyper, here's a reminder:

I heard Manny Man say 'went bookies and put a pound on six, what number came H I?'
Everyone in the room could back the ad-libs, I was in the zone like 'that's a madting'
Now I'm at the MOBOs, yo what's happenin?'
I love grime never stopped grafting
See me in the hot-tub with a bad bitch podcasting

I heard D Double E say 'These days the streets are overly warm, don't watch me rudeboy watch porn'
I was in school I was in top form, now I'm 25 years old in top form
Man said ""Why do grime what for?""
Now I'm like 'I love life on tour'

I'm like a pitbull with a lockjaw, I'll spin man
I used to listen to Grim Dan say that he's got no heart like the tin man
If man can't dodge then you better block
Man'll let em off straight through the letterbox and lick man
From '06 when I started to spit fam -- Hitman
Now all the youngers look up to me like a big man
So I just tell em ""you know what it is fam""

'You think you're sick 'til you get kicked out your Birmingham bed'
I used to listen to Midlands Mafia
Same time Chip said ""gal on my Eriksson"" man had one bag of gal on my Nokia
I was a virgin, servin' 'em zeds
Went school in Great Barr, I know some Kingstanding and Erdington heads

Part 1, suck your big fat mum
Part 2, any boy test get slew
Part 3, I used to listen to K Double E and Tempa at the center MC
Like gyaldem shake your bumper down
Then gyaldem shut the bumper down low
Before I rolled with Boy Better Know
Before Smokes was my bro
I used to get down with the graveyard flow like Gio Gio, lets go
Crew at the front say (buh)
Crew at the back say (buh)
Now I'm mighty like Mo
They're liking my flow, the life that I chose is clear
I wanted to be an MC-er
Now I say 'Gio Gio' because my goal is clear
Trust me, man are here

I used to get gassed when I heard MB say 'you ain't been brought up, you've been dragged up, and your mum looks like she's been drugged up""
That shit inspired me to write bars that are fucked up
And if you know about Sox from day, you'll know about Snipecamp and about Young Bloods
Man was Killer Cartel with 25 gal, handguns and nunchucks

Now -- Big man, manna blown up
I bust my nut out of my japs eye into a japs eye 10 minutes after I woke up
And filmed it all on a GoPro, HD 1080p close up
Then sent it to her dad like ""if you don't transfer a bag then a YouPorn video goes up""",Sox,1964,"[86, 93]",2
83,Percolatin',"Unholy bean of the unclean
It is grown near the equator
Grinded well where evil dwells
Brewn with a percolator
Forget speed, all I need
Is a nice cup of joe
Lethargic, crave black magic
Sip the robusta brew

Drinking coffee all the time turns me to a maniac
Adenosine receptors lets caffeine in it's embrace
Bloodlust set loose by adrenaline indulged insomnia
As my pituitary gland sends me on a brutal rampage

Cease with tricks
I need my fix
Fool me with decaf
And awake my wrath
Weak drink spill
Time to kill
En kopp slät
Jesus grät

Coffee, coffee, coffe
Overdosing
Execution style	of your chosing

Pour the potion of mystic vigor
In my coffee cup
Leave out milk and sugar
Or I'll have to fuck you up

The strongest ebony brew
Enough to cause a heart attack
Don't want no macchiato
I prefer my coffee black

84,Little Bell,"Little Bell. Little town. They dragged you from your little house. Tied you up, but you were never bound. Can you imagine how sweet the sound? Can you fathom how sweet the sound? Little thoughts, little plans, make their way into the hearts of men. Who one day will bow to the servant’s hand. Can you imagine how sweet the sound? Can you fathom how sweet the sound? Little hate in little men. Were scared to death of your love so big. They hung you up and burned your flesh where you imagined how sweet the sound. Can you fathom how sweet the sound? Every breath I take from you I’m calling out your name. The love I have inside my soul is dancing like the flame. I told you once and I’m never gonna change. Time never stops and my voice will always sing. Little hearts and little hands are stronger than the armies of hell. Love is strength and peace will reign. Can you imagine how sweet the sound? Can you fathom how sweet the sound?",Northlander,1964,"[88, 100]",2
85,(There'll Come A Day When) Ev'ry Little Bit Hurts,"[Excerpts from Rebel XD’s 1998 Guinness Primetime Episode]

[Verse 1 – Rebel XD (Chopped from P@ND3MIC)]
And I'm abolishing wacks with astonishing raps
That'll complement tracks, In fact
These hacks couldn't follow my act
Even if they had got them an atlas, a compass and map
And tried to match tit for tat the tactics, that I spit
When my raps hit the tracks quick, as if, my lyrics had tricks
Like that of an acrobatic, or some active, bad kids
That were doing back flips from up off of the mattress
And that mixed with a little bit of madness
And magic and mathematics
For calculating the data that I got ta add
Up into all of my raps and beats
Cos when I be making each master piece, or rap classic
I'm making them far surpass average
They're sleeping upon this, it's like they counting sheep
Up under they sheets in pajamas
But at least it'll be keeping them honest
When I be speaking that heat I'm the hottest
Like when the heat peaks in Nevada
So keep trying to bring that beef and that drama
And you'll get eaten alive like you've just reached the Bahamas
And you was eating Mc Donalds while deep in the water
That was full of man eating piranhas!
I'm ma feast upon this beat
And eat it like a piece of red meat
In fact, I'll kill this track so bad
That I'm ma have it like a baby's dad when I'm done
Because it'll become a dead beat
I'm making them bombs drop non stop
And these lyrics that I spit'll harm blocks
Full of niggas like armed cops
Who wanna spawn shots even up in the clam spots
And I'm making them hit rock bottom like bond stocks
That everyone drops, from when a companies funds flopped
You was once tops but then you began to become NOT
Now you sounding like some dumb bot
And anybody who wanna try to respond -STOP!
Cos how can you respond -HOT
When you bums got
Rhymes that sounds like they come
From pawn shop?!?!
Ya bum clot, any rhyme that Rebel'll concoct, it's like a gun cocked
Tis a mega ton Glock coming to pump shots
Making my tongue hot
And making them punks drop and I won't stop
Making them bums flop
And in the meantime when I plan lyrics and this man spit it
Nobody can stand near it or put a hand in it
Because I planned To cause panic to the planet and land, dig it?
It's a pandemic!

[Verse 2 – Union City Love]
Like a pandemic, Ebola, from a while ago it flows from labs from bags. They dragged it down to Africa, blamed the black man, but genocide is before us, see the Guide Stones in Georgia? 500 thou’ the will allow, while they disavow crimes inflicted, none convicted. Let me decrypt the messages, 2030’s asteroid prediction, end of an age, is you tripping? Listen. Too distracted while the diamonds
Glisten, been eating too much packaged piss and let me spit with this master here. Throw my brain in gear while I learn, I yearn to make my mouth burn in tongues we spun to make your ears run. But its all good fun. Expression’s the lesson we blessing. So best turn up the volume, I’m calling you to respond. Pull out the gadgets like James Bond. Smooth, suave, original. Make your mind growl, think hard while we take a bow, this music ain’t for dancing. Like in the olden days, it’s a sit down and listen, is you listening? Things on the radio is flashy show. Right here’s raw technique, daring to speak with the man holding the world title, I’m humbled. I feel slow but I do know that I’ve got a story to show. While I grow, I want to share the Do-Si-Do, a Geronimo with words might sound like a blur if your mind ain’t used to devouring faster than most rap pop tunes. I’ll blast fools in my head because silence is golden. Is your brain done unfolding yet? Is this enough content? I think not. Been letting my brain rot on television, made a decision to get out of that prison. Every step that I take to free the clutter from my mind makes me contemplate society. Are we really this blind? Sounds
Divine, but my mind’s hungry, I need to eat. I want to decipher the technique in the seasoning over this red meat. Looks a little bleak but the longer I listen the more it starts to speak. Story’s lacking, the flow is packing, the man behind the stand is not humble at all but I still got respect because his skill is tall. I want to take a claw to rip the ego out of your rap law, so I can really listen to what you have to say on a day to day instead of being insulted. Is that all you’ve got to say? I’ve got far to go but I want to hear wisdom from that sick flow. You know, I see progress in the things I let happen when I’m under stress. I guess I’ve got a lot to address so please bless me Grandmaster XD, you fresh

[Verse 3 – Rebel XD (Chopped from P@ND3MIC)]
Now if it's a pandemic this damn wicked
Then you better believe
That a man like me got a hand in it, can you handle it?
It'll make you and your band wanna abandon it
And leave you stranded with no fans while you stand in shit
Not understanding it
How can you lose so much to the text of some shit
That a wicked nigga said?
Cos it's a plague, it'll get you dead, it'll get cha brain
It'll get ya fame, it'll get cha spot, it'll get ya chop
It'll get cha props, it'll get cha chains!
But I don't care about things that seems to gleam
Like bling and rings, no doubt
Any rapper that'll seem to doubt
That I'm ma bring you down, is just dreaming now
Cos I'm ma sting your clout!
And there will be no vaccine
Or remedy to get rid of me or help the enemy for when I be
In the vicinity because many be dead on arrival
While there'll be no survival on the rap scene
And if there's a cure for this sickness in which is me
Spittin' my lyrics wicked as witches- forget it
Cos this curse is my gift in which I reverse on each person be first
To catch the pandemic!

I hit with a script and I’m rippin and picking and I’m trippin em up and they all will be

Stepping away when I come and then give him a kind da incredible dominate rap in a battle and I’m breaking a rapper that’s making a get away when I be coming and attacking and I hack em and backing em up in a pack and I’m racking em up when I get em I got em in check and I’m wrecking em wanna get out of my realm when I’m coming to jam and the rapping eptomie smacking men silly and I’m trapping and a enemy that I’m a slam!

Hit a sucka and I’m waking em up

Kick and breaking em up when I’m taking the mic up into my hand and I’m ma give a lyric and I’m hurt em and wrecking a man and my lyrics are making them wonder why many be thinking of saying its luck when I’m taking a duck and I’m breaking him up when I get him the minute that Rebel erupt!

Yo the S is on some love tip, you know what love is

She said I wanna be down with the S
I said, certainly let me taste your splendour-ness
Busting a Virgo, you were scandalous
Your fragrance got me losing consciousness
Your stance got me unbuckling my fucking pants
Spending clouds of finance on a two dollar romance
To do dick, to the tip, get a lick
Tell a bitch, the S is the shit, so eat a dick
You need to, you need to - just give me your clit
As I get nasty like an old porno flick
Oral sex, got me caught up in the {?} bliss
T-Cedric, as I drop this dick between her tits

The night was black, rain falling down
Looked for my Baby, she's nowhere around
Traced her footsteps down to the shore
Afraid she's gone for ever more

CHORUS 1
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
“I took your Baby from you away""
I heard a voice crying in the deep
“Come join me Baby in my endless sleep""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my Baby has gone from me

Ran in the water, heart full of fear
There in the breakers I saw her near
Reached for my darling, held her to me
Stole her away from the angry sea

Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
I'm too young to be in misery
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me

I've been waiting at the bus station
'cause that's where you left me standing
I got my clothes in a twenty-five cent locker
And hear you till that greyhound bring you back again

(chorus)

[Verse 2]
Well, I knocked on my mother's door
She said ""Stevie, come on in
You don't have to say a mumbling word
I know your woman left you again.""

Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
What kind of love could this be?
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I gotta - I gotta - I gotta - yes I have...

Frozen tears
It was hard through the years
I'll never give up
Never one of my dreams
Deep inside is my love still alive
And God only knows
That I can't let you go
When I'm in love,it'll be for better

And there's nothing to lose
Cause I'm playing the fool

A little love is better than none

All I really wanna know
Is are you still my baby
I don't care where you've been
Are you still my baby

You say you finally understand
You're calling it a lesson learned

96,Do What You Do Do Well,"He couldn't move a mountain
Nor pull down a big old tree-ee
But my daddy became a mighty big man
With a simple philosophy

Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do we-ell
Give your love and all of your heart
And do what you do do well

Sometimes he'd kiss my mother
And hold her tenderly-why
Then he'd look across the top of her head
Then he'd wink and say to me

Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do we-ell
Give your love and all of your heart
And do what you do do well

Well he was a man of laughter
But a tragedy came by-why
The tears ran free and he'd say to me
Never be afraid to cry

Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do we-ell
Give your love and all of your heart
And do what you do do well

Today I still remember
Just like yesterday-ay
'Bout a mighty big man with a mighty big heart
And a mighty few words to say

Do what you do do well boy
Do what you do do we-ell
Give your love and all of your heart
And do what you do do well
Do what you do do well...",Ned Miller,1964,[100],1

Of a single memory
And I know when I see them swaying
I can hear myself say

When you held me in your arms

If you love me, let me know
Why don't you show me which way to go?

I give to her just what she wants from me
She loves me hard, she loves me right
She'll love me love me through this lonely nite
Then happiness we'll surely know

Do the opening show for some promo kid
Then go home with a slut for some close up shit

Ordinary sort of a happy guy
Bored of the passion life
Forcing an appetite
And sure I’m a rapper like the rest of you wannabes
But got believe in projection of honesty
Left at the bottom seein’ stress and a lot of grief
Kept what I wanna keep separate from what I speak
I’ve never yet ever met what I wanna be
I rep from my policy and step with the God in me
Head’s got a lock and key
Box in a block of dreams
Lost with the nonsense
I’ve constantly gotta speak

Try to keep on up with her but really why bother
Girl's a super hottie plus she parties way harder
Still looking great with no make-up on
Keep going strong 'til the break of dawn
Eighth to the face, take it straight no chase
When she stay to the pace ain't a damn thing wrong
Mother, sister, brother they insist on drinking water
But she's sipping on some liquor, Janice Dickinson had taught her well
Hammered, you can hardly tell, stammered, but she hides it well
Hands up in the air and yells ""Party all the time""
She dance around me in her thong, sing along, favorite song
Rip a shot, hit the bong, going all night long

Yeah, my chick be drinking whiskey just to chase it with a kiss
Then she'll charge it to her card, whole bar, plus tip
Yeah for her and all her friends cause she never pays for shit
Kind of chick that you see on the t.v. (yeah)
Real high heels and her cleavage (yeah)
Rolling up some homegrown asking ""Can we smoke some weed in here?""
Isn't like she needed it but got diamonds and pearls
And definitely ain't a lesbian but kisses other girls
Drives a car that isn't hers, keeps the keys up in her purse
Lipstick, red or pink, tell me which do you prefer?
Mini-skirts exotic furs wanna make the kitten purr
Try to go and buy a drink but split before you finish yours, cause she

Parties all the time, shorty she a dime
Ass like Nicki, barbie in her prime
Stripping on that pole, shorty on her grind

Bottles of that peach got that pussy all dripping
Line goes down the street, room full of bad bitches
Everybody super wasteful and them hoes is mad twisted

I dribbled all on it like basketball

Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

111,Is It True,"[Verse 1]
We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be?

[Chorus]
She just said, ""Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now""
It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my—

[Verse 2]
I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
'Bout the notion I was motioning
I'm just so terrified to face her
Like any moment I might wake up
'Cause she's the only thing I think of
I don't know nothing but I love her

[Chorus]
She just said, ""Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now""
It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my—
In my—

I said, ""We'll see, we'll see"" (In my—)
We'll see
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
See how it goes
Until we know what the future holds
Ah, we'll see

112,Ain't That Loving You Baby,"I could ride around the world in an old oxcart
And never let another girl thrill my heart

Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you baby?
Ain't that loving you so?

I could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun
My hugging and my kissing belong to just one

If you gave me nine lives like an alley cat
I'd give them all to you and never take one back

113,We Could,"[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
We could hide away in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the Sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty, that’s where we run

Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you

Anybody’s got the power
They don't see it ‘cause they don't understand
Spin around and round for hours
You and me, we got the World in our hands

Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind

I turn my face towards the warm night skies
And I am not afraid of a thousand eyes
And there above five hundred smiles
Oh I used to think what wouldn't I give
For a moment like this, this moment, this gift!
Now look at me and this opportunity
It's standing right in front of me

It's only part luck and so

My big opportunity
And now I'm right here and it's time

117,Four Strong Winds,"Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are looking good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
The good times are all gone
So I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may

And getting closer, closer, every day

And I'm almost there, I'm almost there
People down here think I'm crazy but I don't care
Trials and tribulations I've had my share
There ain't nothing gonna stop me now 'cause I'm almost there

I remember Daddy told me, fairy tales can come true
You gotta make 'em happen, it all depends on you
So I work real hard each and every day
Now things for sure are going my way

Just doing what I do
Look out boys, I'm coming through

And I'm almost there, I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there, I'm almost there

There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed the mountain, I've crossed the river

If you cannot toss your heart gaily in the ring
Love me while the moment lingers
If you cannot cross your heart that i'm everything
Try at least to cross your fingers
Talk to me, baby, tell me lies
Tell me lies as sweet as apple pie
Whisper you tremble with a wild desire
To light the fire in my eyes
Tell me i'm marvelous, exaggerate!
Prevaricate if you must
Just talk to me, baby, soft and low
Then if you decide it's really so
Swear you be mine forever, otherwise just talk to me
And tell me lies, lies, lies, lies
Great, big, great big lies",Ray Charles,1964,"[94, 95]",2
121,Chained And Bound,"Darling now, you made me change my mind
Can go no further, because you got me chained and bound, oh
Taller than the tallest pine
Sweeter than a grape on a vine, now
Can go no further, because you got me chained and bound, right now, now

So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad
Oh, I don't have to worry no more
Oh my my my
Baby, somebody, somebody

What kind of life is this kind I'm trying living
Oh Lord, what kind of love is she trying to give me
I feel like I'm standing up and telling the word
I'm chained to your love

Darling, oh
Don't break this little heart of mine
There's no greater love than this love of yours and mine, oh
You walk with your head in the sky
Darling don't ever pass me by
I ain't going no further, because you got me chained and bound, oh now

So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad
Lord, I don't have to worry no more
She got me chained to her love, now
I don't, I don't want to be taken away, baby
I'm chained, I'm chained and a little bound, now, now, now

122,Fiddler On The Roof,"[Verse 1: Sapient]
And I don't need a job to get the dues paid, but I do need to get paid in a regular way before doomsday
The rent comes too late. It's employment or inspiration, and it's a rude awakening when you don't get paid for your labor
But I must have it all wrong 'cuz my heads sick, obsessive compulsive I wash my hands of your stresses
But it takes less with to get highly *can't make out what he says here*, and acceptance- is it worth the adjustment of my sentence?
So if you're human than I am. And if you're not human you better hurry and teach me how to be like that
I'm starting to stop - the Earth is more than just a parking lot - and part of me thought, I should figure it out before my arteries rot
My thoughts get complex, unlike your nonsense
I hope the power doesn't go out my wardrode is electronic
Forever walking on the surface of the quicksand, my sonnet forever resonates with hi-hats, snares, kicks and...

[Hook]
If I were a rich man I'd put down the fiddle and get off this fucking roof. (Get off the fucking roof)
If I wasn't a sick man I would act more civil or at least in front of you. (In front of you)
If I was a perfect man I wouldn't need vices, but I do. (But I do)
And if I was a simple man I wouldn't speak like this, but I do. (But I do)

[Verse 2: Mo-B]
If I want war man with nothin' to lose you'd be envious of my strings while I'm cuttin' 'em loose
I'd rather cut into you (Bleed!) for all the people starving
This is what we mean by trickle down economics
You're counting the commas found left at the decimal, I live within the decibel to find a higher conscious
Turn conflicts and convicts to convalescence
It's all dogma's, dog chains, and brand name depressants
We'll scare the messenger, but we'll kill the message
A truly brilliant man would learn to live with less shit
Preach my leftist perspective to the lame right wing, and when developments arrested then we'll finally find peace
Sit on top of the wave and think you see the whole sea, don't realize just below you lies 20,000 leagues
There's not enough ends to provide our means
The life. I hate you. The Mo-B. Peace

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Al-One]
I slave away day after day and put my dreams to the side
I got.. mortgage payments, my seeds almost 5
I've got everything that I need to survive, but corporate America's killing my soul make me believe in a lie
And I've got no reason to try.. to better myself.. but at least I'm a guy who'd reach for the skies.. and sever myself.. From all the bull shh that goes down around me. And believe me, all the bull shh that surrounds me ain't easy.. to block out, sometimes I want to walk out, and give it all up... like a boxer that's been knocked out
To count to 10, in my ears is like counselin'
The teachers in high school said I'd never amount to shh
And that's fuel to the fire. A person like you, could never have a clue why a person like me don't take it lightly, and what I'm gonna be is like... me

Not to start crying, oh, oh

Than the eye can see
'Cause, baby, inside
My heart is breaking apart
'Cause it'll never be over for me
I'll know every time
I look up at a star, yeah, yeah
Your face is gonna come in view
And every time
The wild wind touches my lip
I'll think of your kiss
And feel so blue
If ever you find
That you were mistaken, oh, oh
No matter how long
That my heart beats

May be over for you, yeah

124,Unless You Care,"[intro]

Everything's beautiful
Every day's a holiday, the day you live without it
Everything changes up, everything shifts and falls unless you care about it

[Chorus]

But you sit there in the darkness
And you make plans but they're hopeless
And you blame God when you're lonely
And you'll call it fate, when you show up too late and it's over

[verse]

Here on the boulevard, you were the golden boy
A mix of brains and muscle
That was a lucky break
Luck is a thing you make
Not just another hustle

[Chorus]

But you sit there in the darkness
And you make plans but they're hopeless
And you blame God when you're lonely
And you'll call it fate, when you show up too late and it's over

[verse]

'cause nothing can wait forever
They don't give unlimited chances in life;
They hand you the knife and tell you to cut it around

So baby let's fly;
Baby let's ride, baby let's ride

[verse]

Cause everything's beautiful, every day's a holiday
But days are getting shorter
The moon and the stars report the boulevard's last resort
And now your last supporter

128,Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me),"Who can I turn to when nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know and so I must go where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me and no one beside me
I'll go on my way and, after the day, the darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you what a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?

Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch

Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor ima die in it)

[Verse 3]
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?

And see the seven hills
In your heart, you'll hear
The songs and laughter
Every dream leads to Rome

You may leave but
Rome will never leave you
Rome will always be
Inside your heart

When they call the last all ashore
And it's time to say farewell
From a Church that
Stands forever more
You will hear Cathedral bells

And the bells will say
A happy voyage home
Hurry back to Rome
It's always waiting
Don't forget when we part

You may leave but
Rome will never leave you
Rome will always be
Inside your heart

Rome will always be
Inside your heart",Richard Chamberlain,1964,[99],1

145,When You Walk In The Room,"I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playing lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room

I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I see a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room

Maybe it's a dream come true
Walking right alongside of you
Wish I could tell you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just any time that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound and I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room
Every time that you walk in the room",The Young Veins,1964,"[48, 35, 37, 44, 58, 71, 97, 99]",8
146,You Should Have Seen The Way He Looked At Me,"I saw him at the party
Standing in the corner
Looking just as good as he could be
And when he caught my eye
I knew I was a goner
You should have seen the way he looked at me

Well, I tell you
He really knocked me dead
So, I don't quite remember
Exactly what he said
I just stood there
And I shook my head
Cause, you should have seen the way he looked at me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The music started playing
And before I knew it
He put his arms around me tenderly
He asked me for a kiss
And I just had to do it
You should have seen the way he looked at me

Well, you know that
He walked me home that night
There was starlight and moonlight
Everything was right
So I kissed him, with all my might
And you should have seen the way he looked at me
Yeah
Whoa-oh-oh-no

He didn't let me down
Cause the very next day
You know he came around
And he told me that he loved me
Yes, he really did now
He said that he was mine eternally
I looked him in the eye
And said, you wouldn't kid now
You should have seen the way he looked at me

And then one day
I wore something new
Something old, and borrowed
And something blue
I remember, when he said, I do
You should have seen the way he looked at me

147,Ain't Doing Too Bad (Part 1),"[Intro: Tim Westwood]
Yo, it's Tim Westwood TV, we're back up in the Crib Session and doing it real heavy for the streets
Shout out to all of the Farm, #OFB
SJ, Bandokay, Double Lz
All of OFB up in the building, shout out to the Sinners, Headie One and Abz, let's go
Project X
Ghosty

Part 1

[Verse 1: Bandokay]
Just circled once, can't circle once so we circle back two times
All it takes is one gang sign for me to pop up and blow out your mind
You ain't moving in disguise, tell bro ""turn right"", tryna do him at traffic lights
Two opps in a day by surprise, no knives, so I swing my arms with my guys
This bad B keeps telling me lies, she reminds me of A1FromThe9
My aunties want to see me shine, don't want me in the 9 tryna air this bine
Tell Lerkz I'll do it any time, my family, my bro, my slime
And if we got Tuggzy in ends, then I got him to 'cause that's bro from time
Broadwater Farm, on the line with the spin ting spinning like Thorpe Park rides
Late night glides, 4 doors or bikes, just tryna make this beat like Sykes
OFB don't do it for the stripes, cock it, lean back, is that an opp in sight?
She wanna be with Bando for the night, whoosh, why's this girl so hyped?

[Verse 2: Double Lz]
Me and SJ in the back of the ride, we're going on a glide, tryna drive on Drive
Well, ask 'bout me, I'm a violent guy, who's them yutes? Bro, spin that ride
Tried leave one in his headie, no lie, within one week, five opps got diced
But shout out Bando, that's my guy, we're bad boys, no Marcus and Mike
Lil Jojo got bored up twice, you don't wanna see Jib with his pirate knife
On the opp block really be searching for deals, tryna bore him like I bored up Snipes
And that's no caps, no lies, 8 millimeters of Rambo knives
In N22 we raised the crimes, gang jump out and wave our knives

[Verse 3: Bandokay]
I'm in the 9 tryna fish, no prawn and if you don't run, get filled with corn
T-shirts get torn, this shotgun's sawn, chop it the same size as Shawn
Look, Bando from morning to morn', bad B back come big like Swarmz
Civilians all beeping their horns for spinning this coupe for a brown skin jawn
OFB's on form, Niners respawn and most of them mans been bored
Them points get scored, Swifty got floored, Lampost got sent to the lord
I ride out in bruck down Fords tryna crash off corn or swing my sword
Bad B come thick like Steff, in London my cats called Bando jawn

[Verse 4: Double Lz]
Hold one in the head but it's nothing like unicorns
And the way DV got bored up then survived, what a fucking miracle
L’z OFB, I'm a local criminal, jump out gang, Xin Zhao, get physical
Got down shh, keep it to a minimal, bake with him, get baked with him
Man slap at crowds, I ain't doing individuals
He too quick, buss lefts and rights, I remember that time on a one hour glide
That was me on the ride with this 6 plus 9, in the two two's on the back of the bike
I've done fell in love with glides, I pulled a pack top, tell me if I'm lying
Man, drop it, drop it then bang, slap, clap it then when they die

[Verse 5: SJ]
Get sent south side, no Bagel, fuck a Bagel, slap corn at your Mac D's
These dumb little opp boys can't at me, try Gun Lean and get shot from the back seat
Tion Wayne gun leans but don't back beef, SJ, I’ll buss man up, I’m a bad breed
Reverse it, corn get crashy, Toyan dashed off, he's a athlete

[Verse 6: Bandokay]
We just circled once, can't circle once so we circle back two times
All it takes is one gang sign for me to pop up and blow out your mind
You ain't moving in disguise, tell bro ""turn right"", tryna do him at traffic lights
Two opps in a day by surprise, no knives, so I swing my arms with my guys
This bad B keeps telling me lies, she reminds me of A1FromThe9

[Verse 7: Double Lz]
Hold one in the head but it's nothing like unicorns
And the way DV got bored up then survived, what a fucking miracle
L’z OFB, I'm a local criminal, jump out gang, Xin Zhao, get physical
Got down shh, keep it to a minimal, bake with him, get baked with him
Man slap at crowds, I ain't doing individuals

That was me on the ride with this 6 plus 9, in the two two's on the back of the bike
I've done fell in love with glides, I pulled a pack top, beg you tell me I'm lying
Man, chop it, chop it then bang, slap, clap it then when they die

[Verse 8: SJ]
Adrenaline rush when you buck into my gang, fry man, I'll swing my sword with my right hand
I know all these opp boys don't like man, it's like man I got all these bad B's tryna line man
In a bando, me and Bando dice gang, dice back, send him back where the line back
I dare any opp boys try man, knife man and swing mans head where these guys hang
Feds tryna link OFB to these bootings, these opps ain't losing
Selection of guns,mans choosing, choosing, it's a hand ting, mans choosing
Gang jump out, that's way more than a bruising
Lord forgive me and they keep it moving, add a K on the gang, little man don't lose it

[Verse 9: Double Lz]
OFB's got too much skengs
When we circle round on the opp block, don't bring phones, just waps instead
We ain't leaving angles bent, too many back doors popped on them
Trip up, drop, oh damn, you're stressed
Free Bradz, free Ingz, OYY keeps taking my friends
OYY keeps taking my friends

Part 2

[Verse 1: SJ]
OFB, we don't window shop, bro caught him a opp and tried turn him off
In this X3, man's swerving off, free Boogie Bando, he got birded off
Whenever we get a burner loss, we just cop a next one and go burst it off
Lil bro's telling me he got his earnings wrong, we just took him OT, now his trapline's gone
Lil PY got smoked, no bong and I'm tryna smoke man with this tre, no Songz
SJ, I've been a real bad boy from young and when I had my Rambo I wasn't allowed in prom
This bad B in the nizz with phones, she keeps telling me she wants the Niners gone
Bando's telling her she can ride along and if Lz in the cut, this ride gets long
OFB, we don't window shop, bro caught him a opp and tried turn him off
In this X3, man's swerving off, free Boogie Bando, he got birdied off
Whenever we get a burner loss, we just cop a next one and go burst it off
Lil bro's telling me he got his earnings wrong, we just took him OT, now his trapline's gone
Lil PY got smoked, no bong and I'm tryna smoke man with this tre, no Songz
SJ, I've been a real bad boy from young and when I had my Rambo I wasn't allowed in prom
This bad B in the nizz with phones, she keeps telling me she wants the Niners gone
Bando's telling her she can ride along and if Lz in the cut, this ride gets long
Like, everyone's trapping and everyone's banging, I think I might just stop rapping
These Nine boys just jumped on a track, K-M-T, who gassed these faggots?
They ain't done no blammings or splashings, what are they rapping?
SJ, I ain't on no chattings, man been verified, blue ticks, old fashioned
And if I start talking 'bout these drills they'll fold up and this song might get taken down
And if you've been touched, please own up, king on your block, let me take that crown
Mans seen armed Jakes at the exit, I asked broski ""will we make it out?""
Oh shit, oh shit, I just see a opp, let me take him out
RIP Lampost, didn't make it out, ouch
She tryna send man down south, when they stay up north, they get saved like ""how?""
Them boy are like Mickey Mouse, they just want attention from kids, some clowns
Post pics like ""drip or drown"", let me drown mans drip, where's your drip gone now?

[Verse 2: Double Lz]
Wap in the ride of course it got tested, fuck off dots ain’t getting neglected
Get him jump up rides and we chef him, wet him dig him up and then bend it
Cock it and kweff him, mummy on my case cah the whips got tinted
They know we done it of course I’m pretending, bro hopped out tryna feed man pellets
But let me not chat too loose, I’m on the opp block tryna fry mans melon
Skeng on the peds while broski’s revving, hand on my heart I'll beat this weapon
Man done numerous work with these leathers, that’s me and S with two fat cheffers
They’re soft like Kevin, I’m up to mischief like Dennis the Menace

[Verse 3: Bandokay/Double Lz/Sj]
I’m on the opp block just 2 of my mates, Lerky-Lerky and my mate SJ
Hope we get back safe bro, don’t buck jakes, I told bro-bro put your foot on the brakes
We’re just tryna tape a next mans estate, tryna add that K, go kway and bake
I see bro-bro whipping up cake-
Shank on man, might circle the 2's but their block come dead like Lampz
[?] fuck off Ramz, did a drop then dash, no way man's swinging my hands
Free all my guys in the can, I can't wait 'till all of my bros soon land
This bad B come Nizz, she thinks she's bad but she ain't standard so this girl can't hang
Wait, let me get something straight
Do you really want to buck into S with his 17 inch, he'll rip man's face
You can get bored like him on the mains if you try run from me and not get away
Made man run for his life, got lucky
I'm in N9 with ***** where these guys got [?], teeth in this mash gon' beat
On the Avs with [?] but it's calm cos they still get filled with sweets
All these mash-ines ain't [?], see an opp on the glide get smoked for free
Peak, now let's watch a pussio leak, jump out and see Toyan skeet
Oppblock walky tours, and if you see an opp, bore him

Part 3

[Verse 1: SJ]
I tell bro that we're going on the glide tonight, grip a shank and don't make excuses
I roll with drillers and trappers, I can't hang 'round bare niggas that's useless
They say that they got teeth for their wap but everyone knows that their wap is toothless
Ride to the Nizz your clueless, crash straight back like nigga you stupid
Grip your tools and use it, I ain't the one to be lying in music
You got ideas in your head but that light won't work when I burst your fuses
All my bros are ruthless and all of my opps are losing
I don't understand how my opps give chat like all of that shits confusing

[Verse 2: Bandokay]
Start of the year got nicked for a M, no comment officer, all the way to the end
Lil Jojo better cover his lense, chopper-chopper, he's hit someone's Benz
The boy Creepz just surfing for gems, didn't find 'em and so we circled again
You ain't scored on the O, can you tell me when? Slide on my block and you're getting ten
This bad b needs to line up the opps and if she's with them, she can hold this flem
This is real shit, no need to pretend, long live neeks, that count was ments
Ments, that didn't make no sense, T bust up his face when he hopped that fence
Black blade swing with all of my strength, swing with all of my strength

[Verse 3: Double Lz]
Aged 15 when I stepped with the botty, chinged him three times, should've said sorry
Get real close tryna push it in properly, G check him when gang too bossy, get real close tryna push it in properly

[Verse 4: SJ]
This south ting just come down north but she's going down south, will this south ting naughty?
In the dance, got my Rambs all bleached up, left the function with my shank all saucy
Get sent down south, no Morley, I'm on this Vespa with this rusty .40
Ayy, naughty, naughty, no one call me and no Snapchat for the porkies
This X3 kicks off like a tank, put your foot on the gas, let's do this neatly
See the way man poked up DV? Ran after, no claps, that's meedy
Fore Street gets taped off easy, the way I pull up blacked out, you can't see me
Reaper I beg you stop these wheelies, opps at Mac D's, let's do this speedy
Move low, not bait, bro changed his plates, broad day, let it rip on the mains
Before we leave this place, make sure it gets taped, take risks on the glide, fuck Jakes
X3, bare space, two boots, let's play, tryna red card man, no games
I see the boys in plain, don't press no brakes or baits so we mount that pave'

Part 4

[Verse 1: Tugga]
Loose is known for doing the banging, banging, SinSquad pull up, they panic
Fore Street Mac D's, I heard you dashing, O'Sav caught up and gave you a splashing
You don't wanna buck Bully with his chopper, he left Fouyad with his ear all flapping
The way YS dropped was fucked, should've seen the way that Trilla splashed him
Suttin' got tanned in the 9, my mum's like ""oh no, what happened?""
I said ""you're late on news, the gang's just done a quadruple stabbing""
I bored DV in his face, like, come and taste this splashing
Any block that thinks they're bad, come Park Lane, we'll show you 'bout badness

[Verse 2: Sneakz]
I'm on the opp block tryna add them K's, I'm beefing olders, I don't beef my age
Verbal, what a silly mistake, fuck’s sake, DV’s on all of our blades
Them man lie, don't come to the Lane, I'm beefing guys that hide on my mains
If you buck into gang, start doing up race
I'm holding my Rambo steady, pushing it in, I hope it don't break
I heard their gang's suicidal, lemme just blam your face
But don't get bored like F, stressed, now all of them are upset
They came to the block with a one pop, shot it in the air then dash from my friends
The same day F lost his ear, he must have gone and lost what he said
Free Joobz, he dips till it bends, or it’s Jigga J with a skeng
And E1 said he’s not involved on TFL, he almost got drenched
You're not a bad boy, no need to pretend, Tugga dips then cleans off his lens

Part 5

[Verse 1: SJ]
Catch K's, add K's, that's normal, I put it on my life that I'll ride for gang
OFB ain't nuttin' like a friend ting, it's more like a family, I'll rise and tan
There's not a day that they rid on the Nizz and we ain't rid back

[Verse 2: Double Lz]
Got things in the Adidas pouch, there's always one thing that I doubt
They're gonna ride back when their friends get bored up, Lil' Jojo ain't rid 'till now
Fuck, mans really beefing clowns, they're staying at home when we circle around
We skid round, opp boys hit ground, opps get got, man I think I lost count
Lowe all the chat man, who you tryna please? On the opp block with my five times three
SJ shanked two yutes at the scene, windows smashed, of course it was Creepz
On the wing niggas know about me, first day I come out I chased that neek
I guess it's a life of a savage, cheff that yute, pray no one sees

Part 6

[Verse 1: Bandokay]
This .380 kicks off corn, there's some small bells but you still go missin'
My whole squad's on drilling, juice been spilling, I'm on the N9 just chilling
Caught me an opp, pop-pop, I'll drill him, I'm a loose screw, everyday man's sinning
Shawty wan' dig him, my hotline's ringing, you know it's money over women
Can't do me like Dillon, my Rambo's twinning, I'll swing my blade tryna kill him
My aunties tell my mum I'm a villain but I'm a good yute, I just want me a million
This shotgun ain't got no safety, double tap that, lean out and I drill him
Bake off on a road called Willan

[Verse 2: Double Lz]
L22 got his forehead shot, you can't tell me about scoring on opps
I got down Snypz in the fucking shop, should've seen the way that pussio dropped
Then again, these yutes are not bad, Kermit hopped out the ride with the dots
Shh got slapped in he's back at Tops, shh got killed for repping that block
Just bucked Turner, where did he go? He jumped that fence, like I really don't know
Big A got cheffed in a Polo, Little Jojo needs to jump off roads
Two different times when he got soaked, ***** screamed that he's not involved
DV got bored up then ran, collapse, I want dead with hope

[Verse 3: SJ]
Them man are some real life Puss In Boots, on the opp block, just grip and shoot
Hold on bro, spin this coupé, do up jump out gang, stick man then move
In the old days where the fuck were you? Grip my Rambo, go dance in the 2
Them man couldn't dance in the T, get your head back chopped like we do Kung Fu
Man's seen you in vids with my opps, so now you're a opp, lil nigga don't panic
What happened that day with Turner, man don't know but I heard he vanished
These 9 yutes take vids on my block, like four in the morning, who are you catching?
The same yute got put on my blade and he take videos on my block just chatting

[Verse 4: Bandokay]
Try Gun Lean and get cheffed in your shoulder, both shoulders so you can't Gun Lean
In the back of the [?] one, six, seven girls on me, no Monkey
Sweet one looking all

Part 7

[Verse 1: SJ]
Step and slide, do up hide and seek
Like, why them boy hide from me?
Do up Usain Bolt cah that boy got speed, sweep, dip, rip, skeet
Take in everything I speak, it's the life I live and this life is peak
Double Lz my bro from knee, I'll slide for him and he'll slide for me
I'm in a G wagon with my flick knife tryna dip guys if I spot me an opper
Any time, any day, it gets cracking, broad daylight tryna do him up proper
I'm tryna M one on the beat but they turn ghosty any time that we pop up
I'm a long lost soul on the northside cah in northside it's my friends they lock up
This bad B's gonna make me sick, why? She don't wanna hold this dick
If this girl's tryna move bare salty, gyal get removed off my contact list
This opp thot's tryna go on boujee, tryna tell me about wife and kids
Ayy, miss, miss, excuse me miss, I think you might have lost your lips

[Verse 2: Double Lz]
If I duppied your friend on the back road, would you come back and avenge your G?
Push in my shank if you're repping the green, free Boogie B, he does it like me
He jumps out the ride, ching man then skeet, I don't like veg but I do up the green
If you're loose on the road, get left at the scene, Big A got bored in the passenger seat
Two got bun in a week
Four got shanked at once, are you crazy? I cut from the scene and I could not breathe
Skengs on peds or in tinted Jeeps, lack on the road, get cheffed up, peak
Double tap dottys and pray that he bleeds, I was only 15 when I got down your G
I beg a man try talk 'bout me

Part 8

[Verse 1: SJ]
We was in this car going 'round, might drive 'round town, just me and my mate
SJ, I'm known to do bootings bait, no basement [?], saying my name
This bad B on the Nizz from kway, no case but she came off a Bandokay
I was peddle bike riding all day, gotta shot [?] but I just bucked jakes
Yo, I'm tryna pack man off these bootings, shootings and all of the opps stay losing
Selection of guns, man choosing, choose it, it's a hand ting, man choosing
Gang jump out, that's way more than a bruising, you can't link me to these shootings
They see me and they keep it moving, add K on the gang, little man don't lose it

[Verse 2: Bandokay]
My broski wan' spill some juice, let's hit the opp block, tell him ""would you too?""
Let's do it in twos, drill from coupés, Bandokay a loose screw
Blacked out on the 9 with Dukes, bro looking alike, don't know who's who
This sweet ones tryna go on rude, now she's up in my DM's going all cute

[Verse 3: Double Lz]
Civilians get out the way, you don't wanna get hit with this fuck off gauge
Run man down broad day with the shaves, ching man's clart then smile on my mains
Bad B brucks her back and give brain, hold up, wait, shh got shaved
It was TPL when we taped that day, done jump out gang tryna blow man's brains
Humongous Rambo, long like Grace, he got cheffed up and he got shaved
They never rid back, like what can I say? You ain't chinged a opp, don't talk on my name
Got the big 12 guage in the 09 plate, bro Boogie B had your block on shake
Hospital beds when shh got shaved, I'll bore man's face for Bandokay

Part 9

[Verse 1: Zeze]
If you talk that talk, better walk that walk 'cause that's how we stay
In the park with waps, so don't come here to play
Got dottys, got MACs, got tre’s, got dingers that are 19 plates
Opp block and we're cruising real late or we're in the traphouse skates on flakes
Early morning, catch corn, no flake, remember when my peddle bike had no brakes

[Verse 2: Zeze]
If you talk that talk, better walk that walk 'cause that's how we stay
In the park with waps, so don't come here to play
Got dottys, got MACs, got tre's, got dingers that are 19 plates
Opp block and we're cruising real late or we're in the traphouse skates on flakes
Early morning, catch corn, no flake, remember when my peddle bike had no brakes
Now it's firm cars like we having a race, copy the drip, is it copy and paste
Who give a shit? I was low on my face, serving up peng in this maze
Gelato, I ain't smoking on Haze

[Verse 3: Double Lz]
Bro's too tapped, he keeps on squeezing, sneezing, this is the shotgun season
Get back gang where the dotty's revealing, S slapped it, jumped out and beat it
Gang 'dem crash, no Flight of the Phoenix, two in the dots for five of these eediats
Shh got cheffed up and then left bleeding, lack on the road, that's normal procedures
Shh got shh, now girls don't rate us, rise that wap, man slide and crash
Weren't on your block when I came with the lighter, circled for time, didn't find no fags
Creeper's chinger come longer than my arms, swing that cheffs get-
Fuck all the chingings, I ride with waps and it's 10 o'clock news if the ting don't jam

[Verse 4: Bandokay]
Why them man love pushing their friends?
Creeps just circled, he ain't seen no gems, so we just circled again
On the other side linking barbies, she don't know I got beef in the ends
Frogz put in more work with his wetter but he's still out firing skengs
Four door whizz or 3-0 ped, tell my young boy, ""move correct""
Free flow in the vibe, lil bro, he got hammers on deck
Nowadays we drill from rides and burn them dingers and wreck
I'm on FaceTime to my broski, don't know no shitty tech

[Verse 5: SJ]
In a dance with a .32, no Wretch but I ain't dancing, I came here to protect
Any opp boys pull up, they're stressed cah you see my lifestyle, you got shot or cheffed
In the ends better show him respect and if you don't, you get put on the bench
Splash man down, I don't care if you're hench, my blade got length, let's put it to the test",OFB,1964,"[52, 49, 50, 62, 66, 79]",6
148,Little Marie,"[Verse 1]
Yes, oh yes, Long Distance, I'll accept the charge, I'll pay
Which loved one is calling me, I did not hear you say
Both are deep within my heart, her Mom and my Marie
It's so good to hear your voice from Memphis, Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Oh, you mean so much to me, more than you'll ever know
Surely, you have not forgot how much I love you so
If you would remember, Dear and sometimes talk to me
Maybe that would reunite our home in Tennessee

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Last time I saw you, just before I had to leave
You did not want to see me off and promised not to grieve
My heart was torn apart as I looked back at my Marie
And there the pieces still remain with you in Tennessee

[Verse 4]
I guess I should stop talking, after all you placed the call
But anyway that I can help, you know I'll help you all
Then she spoke and asked me to come back and see Marie
And live together in our home in Memphis, Tennessee",Chuck Berry,1964,"[54, 58, 61, 76, 93, 93]",6
149,I Had A Talk With My Man,"[Verse 1]
I had a talk with my man last night
He reassured me everything was still alright
After night came light, my blues got bright
He made me know I, I was the star of the show
He said he was mine, all to myself
And I won't, and he won’t never need nobody else
He took me in his arms and tore down my alarm

Oh, yes he did (Yes, he did)
(Yes, he did)
Yes, he did
(Yes, he did)
Yes, he did
(Yes, he did)
Oh, yes he did
Oh, I know he did
I had a talk with my man last night, yeah

[Verse 2]
I said I sat right down and had a talk with my man last night
He filled my heart with pure delight
He told me that he needed me much more than words could say
And then, and then he went on to prove it in such a sweet, sweet way
He said: ""Never again, lonely, lonely, lonely will you be""
And that's when, that's when he asked to marry me
I began to cry, he kissed the tears, he kissed the tears from my weeping eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, yes he did (Yes, he did)
Yes, he did (Yes, he did)
Yes, he did (Yes, he did)
(Yes, he did)
Yes, oh yes he did
I had a talk, I had a talk with my man last night

Don’t you believe it

Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh

[Verse 1: Kim Weston]

What good is a wedding if no one says ""I do""?
Tell me, baby what good am I without you?

[Chorus: Both]
Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye]
What good is a flier if he don't have a plane?
What good is a doctor if he can't cure the pain?
Tell me, what good is a sweetheart who proves to be untrue?
What good, baby, am I without you?

[Bridge: Marvin Gaye & Kim Weston]
I'm no good without you, and there's one thing I know
I just got to have you, darling, 'cause I love you so
What good is living without the one you love?
And what good is the heavens without the stars above?
What good is a true heart that proves to be broken in two?

Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand

And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today

Everybody knows you've been painting the town
He could never love you the way that I do
And maybe I'll find somebody else
But oh, I still love you
Every night I keep on cryin'
And I pray that you'll stop lyin' to me

New year where the fuck is my head at

Come around while I'm down
Breaking down on the floor

156,Tobacco Road,"[Verse 1: RA Scion]
I guess it has been a minute
And the south paw ain't felt right without the pen in it
Sent for incentive and sittin' submissive
But nothing bringing Jimmy back, you know that praying is a waste of wishes
I made a decision carry on, honor lives in the deed
Though the muse moves in decreased speed
Due to the wait, my dude lose patience with me?
Favor the Blue, you knew what I was training to be
I came for the taking of something they ain't seen back in Henry
The proximity to Knox's Fort's not given any but
Cause to envy Lord when have we fought the enemy?
With more that afforded, we're storming the port of entry
In memory of the James Clan, my symphony of the
Flames fan to conquer, when the song come on pay the band
Send a percentage back, Oldham owed, factor in estate tax
Or waive it if it goes to pave Tobacco Road

[Hook]
Some memories I kept
Others left, others I must have let go to protect
Hold a check for the row I set ready? No, not yet
Well lemme know and I'll return to collect
They never found me cause Valerie's boy had a different rhythm to play to
And he gon' use his tools to break through
Mindful of the nights in that state, who they say life is what you make it
When really life is what makes you

[Verse 2: RA Scion]
Paying homage, with a big nod to Aubrey
The schools failed me, thank God the farm taught me
The value of a calloused hand, how to work and plow this land
How even a modest crop will make your pop the proudest man
Harvest of a thousand fans, sans a gram of seeds broadcast
Through loud speakers, in the weeds I was born last
Profound effect on my volume, plus the readiness to fill it
In the field you should hear what they call 'em
Regardless I should have spent another year on the bottom tier
Instead of trynna dodge what it was I thought got 'em here
89 the number, 84 lumber another summer
Fightin' for cash to mash on the likening
Of cycles I've seen those not keen on college
Lost direction or went to be correctional officers
No opportunity was offered us, I had my sights on
Being gone before they cut the lights on, Ryan's song
Right or wrong, tie it tighter, I'm tired of buying into
Guidance gone awry, my father fought it with firearms and
Died in the trauma the violence spawned a child of drama
No wonder he's prone to wander, knowing his home is haunted
Praying that over yonder they still know
How much I love 'em I just had to go, had it with the status quo
They're asking me if I'll be back when I'm old
In fact, no these are my last tracks along Tobacco Road

But I'll forever call it home
And I feel it whenever I call home (X4)",Common Market,1964,"[41, 15, 14, 15, 15, 25, 30, 44, 60, 72, 90]",11

163,When You're Young And In Love,"Spring in the air (filled with love)
There's magic ev'rywhere
When you're young and in love

Life seems to be (just a dream)
A world of fantasy
When you're young and in love

Each night seems just like the Fourth of July
When stars spangle the sky

The moon at night (shines so bright)
Seems to shine twice as bright
When you're young and in love

Ooh, dreams can come true (try a dream)
If you believe they do
When you're young and in love

Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love can conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love

(Look and you'll find)
Ooh, ooh yeah
(There's no mountain you can't climb)
When you're young and in love

Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love can conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love

(Young and in love)
So in love
(Young and in love)
Oh, yeah
(Young and in love)
I feel so good",The Marvelettes,1964,"[66, 51, 48, 50, 58, 66, 70, 80]",8
164,Hey Now,"[Verse 1]:
Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now, I can feel my instincts here for you
Hey now, by my bed for you
Hey now, hey now

[Hook]:
Oh, you know it is frightening
Oh, you know it’s like lightning
Hey now, now

[Verse 2]:
Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now, leave it to the wayside like you do
For you, imagination calling mirrors for you
Hey now, hey now

[Hook]:
Oh, you know it is frightening
Oh, you know it’s like lightning
Hey now, now, hey now, now
Hey now, now, hey now, now",London Grammar,1964,"[76, 76, 81, 89, 94, 99]",6
165,Beautician Blues,"I met a fine beautician
In a very fine condition
She was long and lean
And you know what that means
She's a good lovin' mama
A hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money
I don't have to worry about a thing

She works hard all day
Dressin' hair
Man you can bet
I want to get somewhere
With my good lovin' mama
My hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money
I don't have to worry about a thing

I meet the finest woman
From everywhere
Because my baby
Dress their hair
I'll be her lover boy
She treats me like a king
She makes a lot of money
Don't have to worry about a thing

Yes, she keeps her hair
So neat and fine
And every pound of her is mine
I'll be her lover boy
I'll be happy as a king
She makes a lot of money
Don't have to worry about a thing",B.B. King,1964,"[82, 86, 91]",3
166,The Dodo,"[Verse 1]
We were walking down the block when we thought the bomb went off
And our hearts nearly stopped at the sound
And when we looked and we found that it hit some other crowd
I was glad it wasn't us, yeah I was proud
'Cause I fall and I break just as easy as an egg
Yeah, my shell isn't as hard as it seems
And when my insides gush out there's no telling what's about
When it'll stop, when it'll seed, when it'll bleed

[Chorus]
Yeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home
Yeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home

[Verse 2]
Well, I take a look outside and see the pretty girls walk by
But I can't make myself say ""Hi"" because I'm scared
It's 'cause I spend all this time all locked up inside
It's the only place I know how to bare
'Cause you can go out and meet, oh some girl you can't defeat
And you think that she must be the one
Until you're walking down the aisle and she takes away your smile
Boy you wish you hadn't dialed before you rung

[Chorus]
Oh, you should stay in your home, in your home, in your home
Yeah, you should stay in your home, in your home, in your home

[Verse 3]
Well they talk of your past, yeah they said it wouldn't last
But now they're running pretty fast back on their word
'Cause it was gone for a while, but it's coming back in style
Better run back where you're from and join the mass

[Chorus]
Yeah, we'll just stay in our homes, in our homes, in our homes
Yeah, we'll just stay in our homes, in our homes, in our homes",The Dodos,1964,"[83, 85, 90]",3
167,Sometimes I Wish I Were A Boy,"Sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy

I've been standing by the jukebox
Hoping he'd ask me to dance
How I wish I could run to him and hug him
But a girl musn't make an advance

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy

But sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy

Oh he's dancing with another
And he's holding her so tight
Wish I had nerve to cut right in and stop it
But a girl has to be polite

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy
But sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy

Now the record hop is over
And I think he caught my eye
Here he comes heading straight in my direction
There he goes, he's passing me by

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy
But sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy
Sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy",Lesley Gore,1964,"[86, 91, 92, 96]",4
168,I've Got The Skill,"[Verse 1]
You know I can't find the letters
You wrote to me in school
And that shoebox full of photographs
Got lost in my last move

I gave away that old twin bed
Where you and I first laid
But after all this time
I've still got the love we made

[Verse 2]
And that old beat up car we dated in
Finally turned to rust
And the first rose that you gave me
Oh, it finally turned to dust
But all those tender nights we shared are never going to fade

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've got every feeling
We felt when touched
Because even though fell apart
I kept a part of us

I've held on to every time
We held each other tight
And promised that no matter what
We'd never say goodbye
I don't have one souvenir of us I'd meant to save

[Chorus][x2]",Reba McEntire,1964,"[89, 100]",2
169,Never Trust A Woman,"Don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
Yes don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street

She'll smother you with kisses
When her birthday comes around
But as soon as she gets her presents
She'll down talk you all over over town
No don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street

She'll beg you for clothes and diamonds
Until you're all in hock
And then you'll come home one mornin'
And your key won't fit the lock
Don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
Well, one day she'll say that she loves you
The next day she'll throw you in the street

She'll call you every mornin'
Every mornin' noon and night
She'll call you in between times
Just to see if you're doin' alright
She'll ask to borrow five
And then she'll beg for ten
And baby that five and ten
You won't ever see again!

Man don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street",B.B. King,1964,"[90, 95, 96]",3
170,High Heel Sneakers,"Put on your red dress baby, honey we're goin' out tonight
Put on your red dress baby, honey we're goin' out tonight
Want you to wear your boxin' gloves in case some fool might want to fight

Put on your high heel sneakers, throw that wig hat on your head
Put on your high heel sneakers, throw that wig hat on your head
Honey I know you're gonna get real high, honey I know you're gonna knock 'em dead

Want you to talk to me baby, Mama and hold me tight
Keep on holdin me baby, until you hold me just right
Put on your high-red dress mama, wear your wig-hat on your head
I want you to hold your head kinda high because I know your gonna knock em dead

Put on your white boots baby, pull em up on your legs so high
Put on your white boots baby, pull em up on your legs so high
I want you to look real good, you better even hide your thigh

Lord I want you to call my name this morning, call it sort of sweet and low
And make me think little darling, Lord I'm on the third floor!
Put on your high heel sneakers, wear that wig hat on your head
I want you to raise your dress real high because I know your gonna knock em dead

Raise your window woman, raise it soft and slow
See your man down there could be
You may don't know, anh-uh
Girl I ain't going out that do'
Oh, I see your man downstairs--
Look like your man, how do I know?
Could be yo' man, how do I know?

Put on your red dress baby, wear that wig hat on your head
Put on that red dress baby, wear that wig hat on your head
Want you to cock your forty five, in case some fool might want to fight
Oh I know you're gonna get real high, oh I know you're gonna knock 'em dead
I know you're gonna get real high, I know you're gonna knock 'em dead",Buddy Guy,1964,[91],1

172,A Summer Song,"Trees swayin' in the summer breeze
Showin' off their silver leaves
As we walked by

Soft kisses on a summer's day
Laughing all our cares away
Just you and I

Sweet sleepy warmth of summer nights
Gazing at the distant lights
In the starry sky

They say that all good things must end some day
Autumn leaves must fall
But don't you know that it hurts me so
To say goodbye to you
Wish you didn't have to go
No no no no

And when the rain
Beats against my window pane
I'll think of summer days again
And dream of you

They say that all good things must end some day
Autumn leaves must fall
But don't you know that it hurts me so
To say goodbye to you
Wish you didn't have to go
No no no no

And when the rain
Beats against my window pane

Don't you break my heart

Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe

My biggest mistake was loving you too much
And letting you know
Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causing me

Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe

175,Cousin Of Mine,"There's a scandal
In the neighborhood
And it's all about Julie Brown
It seems a long
Lost cousin, Jeremiah
Had lately arrived in town

Now when Julie's fella
Came to call
And saw them kissing

Lyrics courtesy Top40db

He started home at once

Now Julie said
I'm surprised at you
Don't go acting like a dunce

Why, he's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine
You're liable for to
See him here any old time

He's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine, go on
He's a cousin of mine

Now when Julie had
Explained her relationship
He said, honey, that may be so

But this fella don't look
Like a thirty-second cousin
That I met here a week ago

Julie smiled at him
And joined her cousin, sad
And as they slowly walked away

He heard him ask
Who was that fella
And he heard his Julie say

Why, he's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine
You're liable for to
See him here any old time

He's just a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine, go on
A cousin of mine

Would I fool you, go on
He's a cousin of mine",Sam Cooke,1964,"[38, 31, 33, 37, 42, 48, 60, 73]",8
176,I Don't Want To See Tomorrow,"(Wayne/Morris)

(I don't want to see tomorrow
Unless I see it with you.)

Tomorrow, so they say
Will be a lovely day
A bright new sun will suddenly break through
But I don't want to see tomorrow
Unless I see it with you

Tomorrow, so I hear
The clouds will disappear
The door to happiness will open wide
But I don't want to see tomorrow
Unless you're there by my side

Don't want to walk alone
Don't want to dream alone
Just want you close to my heart
For if your love is gone
How can I face the dawn of
Sunday, or Monday?
I just can't face one day...

Until you say you're mine
Oh, darling, please be mine
And make each bright tomorrow young and new
But I don't want to face tomorrow
Unless I see it with you

(Tomorrow, so I hear
The clouds will disappear
The door to happiness will open wide.)
But I don't want to see tomorrow
Unless I see it with you",Nat King Cole,1964,"[40, 36, 34, 39, 41, 51, 55, 81, 85]",9

178,Lumberjack,"[Intro]
Ride this train to Roseburg, Oregon, now there's a town for you
And you talk about rough
You know a lot of places in the country claim Paul Bunyon lived there
But you should have seen Roseburg when me and my daddy come there
Every one of them loggers looked like Paul Bunyon to me
And I was a skinny kid about sixteen
And I was scared to death when we walked into that camp
None of the lumberjacks paid any attention to me at first
But when my pa told the boss that me and him wanted a job
A lot of 'em stopped their work to see what was gonna happen
That big boss walked around me looked me up and down and said
Mister, I believe that boy is made out of second growth timber and I guess I was
Everybody but me and pa had a big laugh over it
Pa got kinda mad and the boss finally said he might start me out as a high climber
I didn't know what a high climber was, boy, I sure learned fast
That steel corded rope cut my back and that axe
I thought it was gonna break my arms off but I stuck with it
It wasn't long 'til I learned that a man's got to be a lot tougher than the timber he's cuttin'
Finally I could swing that crosscut saw with the best of them

[Verse 1]
I lived on a farm out in Iowa
I pulled the corn and I worked in the hay
Got trapped by a girl but I wiggled free
Heard the Oregon timber calling me

[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Well, I learned this fact from a logger named Ray
You don't cut timber on a windy day
Stay out of the woods when the moisture's low
Or you ain't gonna live to collect your dough

[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't know

[Verse 3]
Well you work in the woods from morning to night
You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight
On Saturday night you go to Eugene
And on a Sunday morning, your pockets are clean

[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't know",Johnny Cash,1964,"[64, 53, 53, 57, 64, 71, 90]",7
179,Look Away,"[Verse 1]
Two eyes staring back at me
From a magazine in my room
Cut out paper tragedies
Paper tragedies that I glue
Show up cause of memory
If it only feels black and blue?
Creating a fantasy
Something I can dream
That is true

[Hook]
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
If you say

[Verse 2]
I don't see it
Another message left for me in code
Hieroglyphics
I never figured out how to
Unfold your paper crane's origami agony
I ripped the edges
It gave me pleasure
Figuring it out
Each question in a shroud
It's been forever, wasn't forever

[Hook]
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away

[Bridge]
Now when I close my eyes I see how much I've lost
From scratching a memory 'til all the colors off
Revealing a jagged line still there in black and white
When I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
But I can't laugh about it yet
It's all too soon
The things we used to joke about have all come true
I had to slowly back away

[Hook]
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
I will only look away

I will never look away

181,Times Have Changed,"[Verse 1: IAME]
For quick bread you're quick to tradin' your soul and ideals
Like hoes that strip naked on poles in high heels
We cheat, lie, steal, sell guns and poisons to kids
It's dirt, and legit work's the last choice on our list
We're prisoners that work for these wages
Fuck it, I'ma serve 'em hell with this twelve gauge
At minimum range from the bank teller
Tell her put the shit in the bag
Anyone moves, I'll shoot this bitch in the face
But it's no wonder we look timid, it's evident from the inner cities
The ghettos, even the suburbs, these sentiments go unheard
I run a vision so blurred, there's no cure in sight
In the abyss we submerged, we search for light
Most'll only find a serpent's bite with no workman's comp
When the work stops, that's when a person dies
I'ma load a weapon with a empty cartridge, don't start shit
Unless it's some sort of charitable act, what else you got, bitch?

[Hook: DJ Spark, scratch and sample]
It's not a game, it's a lot of pain
You thinkin' it's all good? Times have changed
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain
As far as rap goes, it's only natural, I explain

[Verse 2: Ethic]
I'm the governing type to those with an upperhand
This gutter is right, yeah, but I need to expand
It's a cumbersome plight, a thundering city lights
When livin' under the gun is someone holdin' a knife
When workin' another day means workin' another night
Mixed with the adrenaline of a condition that might
Have me flip on this light as I rip into yours
I'ma get what I like and exit through these doors
Fuck somebody getting the best of me
It's amazing what one will do when they threaten necessity
Give you a taste of what you see on the news
If you choose to look into the eyes of a stomach without food
I move with the mind of a time bomb, confused
Consumed by the amount of wealth that you abuse
And if you ain't down to help, I'ma start climbin' out
Give these fuckin' papers somethin' to write about

[Hook: DJ Spark, scratch and sample]
It's not a game, it's a lot of pain
You thinkin' it's all good? Times have changed
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain
As far as rap goes, it's only natural, I explain

[Verse 3: OnlyOne]
I choose to survive when we're losin' our lives
It's gotta be the system with poverty, imprisonment
Dishonesty and sinners institutionalised
My cousin's been in the pen, a pig shot him in his ass
I'm in abduction with my brother, I made a visit to ask
Why the fuck has he been livin' behind a visitor's glass?
Visit my past, Dad hit Mom, she hit me
Now I hit blunts and licks, get shit 'cause it's free
When there's so much I've seen, and it's scary on average
I would steal green, smugglin' through carry-on baggage
Beware of a savage, 'cause if I go crazy
I'll have a tie with all those other motherfuckers that raised me
There's a fiend's face inside of my brother and his lady
He's freebasin' on oninons, even in front of his baby
Believe even I could be like him with a gun and just maybe
I get clapped, 'cause fuck bein' outrun when they chase me
Knahmean?

Where the best surfers in the world come to stay
And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

Ride, ride, ride the wild surf

Surf fever brings them here to meet the test
And hanging round the beach you'll see the best

The surf to build up on the northern shore

Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it 'cause you've just gotta ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
The heavies at the pipeline are okay
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone

Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last
Gotta take that one last ride

Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye!
Don't try to stop me Horace, please!

Wave your little hand and whisper
""So long dearie""
You ain't gonna see me anymore
But when you discover that your life is dreary
Don't you come a knockin' at my door

For I'll be all dolled up

That says you dog, I told you so!

So wave your little hand and whisper
So long dearie
Dearie should have said so long
So long ago

Ah, you've treated me so rotten and rough
I've had enough of feelin' low
So wave your little hand and whisper
So long dearie
Dearie should have said so long
So long ago!

For I can hear that choo-choo callin' me on
To a fancy new address
Yes, I can hear that choo-choo callin' me on
On board that happiness express

I'm gonna learn the hoochie koo and smoke a cigarette
I'm gonna go as far away from Yonkers as a girl can get!

So...

And on those cold winter nights, Horace

Snuggle up to that cash register!

It's a bit lumpy but it rings!

(sung)
Don't come a knockin'

194,Maybe Tonight,"[Verse 1]
Every time I get out of bed
Another morning text from my girl
And this how it read
""Love you so much, have an amazing day
And don't let any stress, get inside your head""
Warming up the mic as I write these lines
Letting out the stress livin' in my mind
Waking up at six, passing out at dawn
Writing out punchlines, like click clack bang
Feeling like I'm livin', like I'm goin' insane
Finally got a buzz man, where is the champagne?
People throwing out these daps
Cause they like these raps
Y'all don't even know my real last name
Make it a livin'
See, every minute we driven
Always giving, gotta win it
Gotta pave our own way
Someday I'ma get it one way
Up late, tryna get it straight, innovate
No name I write is in ink
No ones ever permanent
A kid tryna make it off rap
Everybody's heard of it
Who's got a hunger like mine?
Losing my voice after every single session
I've been battling depression
But I'm doing just fine
Will I ever make it?
That's the million dollar question
I've been running out of time

[Chorus]
Every night I'm falling back to what I dream of
Tonight is the night that we living it
Alright

[Verse 2]
Maybe it happens or maybe it doesn't
But just like the wind you don't see when it's coming
Zero to something
Out here I'm hunting, the bay to NY
Then a flight out to London
Life's too short to live basic
Starts in your chest like base hits
Giving everything I got to see
Myself on screen, screaming, ""Momma, I made it!""
Vibe with it, just vibe with it
Tonight is the night we fly a bit
Workin' in my room
Always passing out at noon
I can see it coming soon
Like you holding down the zoom
Now we dreaming of the future
On the things that it'll be like
Person I'ma be like
All we see is green lights
Green lights
Nothing's ever what it's seem like
Yeah, I wonder what it be like

[Chorus]
Every night I'm falling back to what I dream of
Tonight is the night that we living it
Alright

[Verse 3]
Time to excel
B.E.T cypher to XXL
Nothing to say, not a whole lot to tell
'Cause you've seen the tape
Roger Goodell
Workin' in the bay, while the east coast want it
See me in your city like a visiting comet
Rappers say they're on
I've been already on it
Showing you my mind
With these lyrics I'm drawing
Bussing every table
Just to make about a penny
I've been dreaming of the day that I really get paid
Nothing but a youngin'
I've been always getting ready
For the moment that my name is being called on stage
Livin' what they said I couldn't, but This the only life I know
And the stress always comes and goes
Maybe I'ma lose control, cause these highs always come from lows",Ivan B,1964,"[88, 88]",2
195,Heartbreak Hill,"[Verse 1]
A long long time ago when we were young
You swore to me I would be the one
I would be the one you loved, but we had to part
You asked me to wait for you to keep you in my heart
Keep you in my heart

[Chorus]
Night after lonely night
I'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town
Here on heartbreak hill

[Verse 2]
Now maybe I am the foolish kind to think of you so long
Have you found another love? Am I still the one?
Am I still the one for you, but you're far away?
Do you ever dream of coming back to me someday?
Back to me someday

[Chorus]
Night after lonely night
I'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town
Here on heartbreak hill

[Bridge]
On heartbreak hill, alone at night
I think of how you held me tight
And wonder if I ever will see you again
On heartbreak hill?

[Verse]
Oh Lord, if I only could go back in time enough
I'd hold you in my arms again and never let you go
Never let you go my love and leave you far behind
High upon this lonely hill where you swore you'd be mine
You swore you'd be mine

[Chorus]
Night after lonely night
I'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town
Here on heartbreak hill

Night after lonely night
I'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town

196,It Hurts To Be In Love,"(Howie Greenfield and Helen Miller)
It hurts to be in love
When the only one you love
Turns out to be someone who's
Not in love with you
It hurts to love her so
When deep down inside you know
She will never want you
No matter what you do
And so you cry a little bit
(It hurts to be in love)
Ah, I die a little bit
(It hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way
How long can I exist
Wanting lips I've never kissed
She gives all her kisses
To somebody else
She thinks I'm just a friend
Though it hurts I must pretend
The only way to keep her
Is to keep it to myself
And so I cry a little bit
(It hurts to be in love)
Oh, I die a little bit
(It hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way
[Instrumental Interlude]
And so I cry a little bit
(It hurts to be in love)
Oh, I die a little bit

'Cause I'm so lonely

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'

For a man to beg

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'

Lonely nights echo your name

Will I ever be the same?

You know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see has all been rehearsed

This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside, darling
Makes me feel half alive

Ya know, you give a man a reason for living
Not to mention, you take my paycheck
Now baby, but I give it to you because I love you
Ya know cuz the things that I feel so proud about
The things that you do
Ya know, like runnin' my car into telephone poles
But I still love you baby, I didn't get mad did I?

W-W-When I tried to take my clothes to the cleaners
And on the way out

I was proud because you thought, enough of your man
To be in such a hurry
It made me feel grand, yes it did
Uuh I need you, I just need you

[Verse 1]
Uh
You know I was your bread, your butter
And I ain't talkin bout that bread I fucked up on you
Cause in my head man I swore I lucked up
Wasn't countin all the butter I spreaded on you
So true now, why would I play you bitch I made you
I'm not talkin bout the things that I gave you
Clothes wit the labels, I brought you round Hov and the label
Spring water while holdin you're age koo
Naw I ain't tryin to degrade you
But you was a lost little girl n you're world boo I saved you
Ya pop owe me a favor, I basically raised you
From squada to Bentley-whippin
Ain't have to watch Cribs to see how I was livin

Huh, shoulda seen the Ginger in you
Tried to off Beans like Rothstein? Go figure
Youu take my dough, spend wit the next nigga you crazy bitch?

And dis was the one I trusted
Who would ever think she would spread like mustard
Bitch I was your bread and butter

Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
Any second, you may suddenly appear

The people, they stop and stare, they don't bother me
'Cause there's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Let them all roll by, I don't care if I
As long as I'm on the street where you live

Take me back on that street

It ain't nothin' for me to ball on you

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I wanna be where the commas will be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then its dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
Cause it's levels to this shit, and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright

You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, baby

Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real

Once I had a man and he was right for me
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
That you couldn't help but care
When he looked at you
He called me baby
Baby all the time

He said, 'Baby can't you see?'
'Baby understand?'
'Baby you're for me'
'Oh won't you take my hand?'
But I push him away
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away
And now I'm wishing I could hear him
Call me baby, baby all the time

It's so lonely through the day
Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours without that
Man I held so tight
Lord I pray that you will listen to my plea

The blossoms raised their thirsty heads

Surely here was charm beyond compare - to view
Maybe it was just that I was there - with you

'twas just a garden in the rain

Alot of sin bout to be committed
You messed around with this bald headed fool
You done did it
I can't look back at what I've done
Now I'm on the RUN like DMC
Somebody help Lord forgive me
For all of my sins
Do I still have a chance to go up top
Probably not
I do not want to get caught
Even though sometimes I think that I deserve it
But the Devil got's me captive
I gotta stay active
Now who be the next fool
That want's to get that slug
Inside of that dome
And never make it home
Fools wanna mess with the lokest
But a vato like me gives em all a casket
I'll shoot em like a basket
But this ain't Micheal
This is the bald syko
You wanted to box
But now you say that I'm the one that rocks
The Knightowl rains just like water
The dopest of them all
Get's around just like your daughter

[Chorus]
I'm on the outside lookin in
My mind's playin tricks just like chicks
So how am I supposed to win
Evil surrounds me
It's always all around me
I got's to give the man up top
Thanks the day he finds me
[2x]

[Knightowl]
Thank you for the sour note your wrote me
You said that you was my women
But now I'm just assumin
That all them things you said
Was they just a bunch a lies
That had me fall inside a trap
I'm bout to take you off the map
I never met defeat
Until the day I saw you
I'll never but no one above you
Because I love you
But time be makin people change
And act funny
If I didn't have any money
Through out the day would it be sunny
I don't think so
Cause life be full of krime
The place I live is viscious
In order for me to survive
I got to stay maliscious
The Knightowl be comin equipt with the clip
I know that I'm better then all
Ain't nobody like me
Cause I'm that one OG
Untouchable lyrical MC
The one that'll bust
The one that be lettin em know
That I'm the one that's always in control
You better be ready to rock it steady
I creep like Freddy
Like MTV Get Cut
Cause I'm the one that rips it up

Somebody help me find a way
The man that I created
Inside of myself just won't be duplicated
My thoughts be full of sickness
But if you's a witness
You know you got to be the next to split and that's it
The Knightowl never be jokin
That shirt and bllod be soakin
You wanted to battle the loco
Your brains flew out the coco
Now I trip on all of them fools
That claimed they used to be my dawgs
I got that wicked style
I've always been a problem child
It's kind of funny how they all stick tight
They help each other write
But still can't win cause I commit sin
You got no HOPE like BOB
I'm BROWN like FOXY
A presences that be felt
Like I was rockin the mic at the Roxy's
Fools stop and SWEAT like KEITH
You're green just like a leaf
I'm knockin out their teeth
You're just an indian I'm the cheif
And now you got now FAITH like EVENS
You start to tremble
Shakin all inside them boots
Like this was ROOTS

221,House Of The Rising Sun,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

[Bridge - Organ Solo]

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
(I tell 'em…) Aye, I'm on the case getting sideways
Dolla fo' five on the highway
You know a nigga state to state
On a dolo mission, I got a date with the cake
Wide awoke, 3 A.M
Prolly touch down when the sun come in
Aye, when them guards hit the gate
I be tired as fuck after that 8-hour race
I come from the land where we swing our cars
Figure 8 Benz concrete leave marks
Call it paid, super-charged
Back to back race the Benz with the four door Porsche
I'm tearin' up tires in this luxury
Hella smoke says she wanna fuck with me
Money on my mind, ain't nothin' for free
Tryna keep up with me, but it's nothin' to me

Ride like Presley, pills like Graceland
They wanna ship me to Rita and off to reception
Nah, ain't tryna see the state pen
I'm Black Scaled out in my Ray-Bans
Diamond-certified, I ain't never lied
I ain't had L's since Pac died
Ridin' through the biters
Couple bundles talking 'bout sliders
Run from the labors, mind's still swift
FedEx movement all on the bitch
Audi with the stash box, Cazzy too swift
No frontin', push a button, give a nigga that gift

You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me

Doing 'bout a hundred, kinda burnin' up the Louis
Louis, Louis 13th mothafucka, yeah, Louis
D.U.I. drivin' black, Henny on my lap
Pedal to the floor, with a 808 clap
Money motivated, doing sprints when I'm chasin'
And it gotta be a hemi, I don't normally do the basic
Six-cylinder, r-really, bruh? Slow it down, keep up
And I'm killin' ya, hope I'm not offendin' ya
See you at the finish line, leavin' em
Burn rubber, bu-burn rubber
This is how we do it when I'm dippin' on a corner
Burn rubber, bu-burn rubber

Beat his ass, with a strap, I wish a nigga would
I love my bad bitch, but I love that chopper too
Poppin' tags, she like shopping bags, look at all her shoes
Ain't no limitations when you popping and you got the juice

If you wasn't getting money, you was livin' in a struggle
I was taught by the Gs that you better get yours
'Cause, homie, when it rains, you gon' feel it when it pour
Before I hit the streets, I send a prayer to the Man
Put a shield around the family and a vision to the plan
The hustle don't stop, I was born for the win
Doin' dirt in the streets, throwin' rocks at the pen
The game not the same, so I'm in a different lane
'Cause I'ma keep it movin' like blood through the vein
On the rise to the top, and I'm not comin' down
So far from the haters, I cannot hear a sound
I helped build the bridge that you're tryna get across
See the hustle in my face, that's the vision of a boss
And the grind in the street, with the bro Paul Wall
The hustle don't stop, what we tryna show y'all

234,You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart),"Mother told me always to follow the golden rule
And she said it's really a sin to be mean and cruel
So remember if you're untrue
Angels up in heaven are looking at you

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh no!

I've been hearin' rumors about how you play around
Though I don't believe what I hear, still it gets me down
If you ever should say goodbye
It would be so awful the angels would cry

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh no!

(If you break my heart, break my heart)

I can hardly wait for the day when we say I do
It's a day I dreamed of so long now it's comin' true
You will promise to cherish me
If you break your promise the angels will see

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart

You won't get to heaven if you break my heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week

Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch

I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread

You could check my name on the books

The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker

Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game

Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up

I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm glidin' up there, oh so very high that if the
Clouds were to drop me then I'd, fall out the sky, I don't really
Know why I'm here, I guess I'm, just here for the ride, I swear it
Feels like I'm dreamin', it's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want, title me whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight, you know my name
So I run this town, when I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray, I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I flow, rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
I know I've done been down here before
Product of my East Decatur home
'Cause I was in the cold, tryna keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house, now I'm in your soul
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago

[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well I'm from much lower than where that pavement is
'Cause there ain't no parachute that they can make for this
'Cause I put my pain, my heart, my soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel? Then you can relate to this
Or just blaze to this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay everyday, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this
From the womb all the way to the grave I spit
Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is, yeah
I'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies
To picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in the day, then run away at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write

[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall",B.o.B,1964,[100],1

Everybody falls in love somehow

Everybody finds somebody someplace

Something in my heart keeps sayin'
My someplace is here

I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime

Your love made it well worth waiting

[VISUAL]

You can't live your life on a bus...

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY

A white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber

All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end

A chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy

       CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is

He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo

The Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off

The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours

       FATHER: How was camp?

The Boy ""shrugs""

       FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?

       THE BOY: No

The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh

       FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight

       THE BOY: Frito pie

       FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-

       THE BOY (cutting him off): It's Frito pie

Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window

EXT. MANSION - DAY

The Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic

INT. MANSION - DAY

An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care

The Father's phone rings:

       FATHER: Hello

       PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-

Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off

The Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out

INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY

The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice

The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics

He starts checking his mail. His friend ""FAM"" sent him something that says ""this is you"" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video

He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as ""VERY HOTTTTTTT"". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying

""This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! [CRYING EMOJI]"" is the top comment

The Boy stares. Then types ""fuck u niggers"" in the comments

He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart

He refreshes the page. People immediately respond with ""Fuck U"", ""You wouldn't say that to my face faggot"", and ""LMFAO crackers b crazy""

The Boy smiles

INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

The room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer

There is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has ""hackz"" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk

There's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz ""Demon Days"" poster, and a ""Black Dynamite"" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf. Norman Connors ""You Are My Starship"" is the album on top of the others

Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there. Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right

The Boy (more a man now) is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts. He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is a slight mess. Things left out. S'mores makings left out. The marshmallows are hard as stones. The boy goes into the cabinet and pulls out a pop tart. He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave, wrapper still on (you're not supposed to do that). He starts the microwave and begins texting someone. The microwave is okay for about 5 seconds, then blue sparks start to pop inside. He turns off the microwave, opens it, grabs the pop tart and tosses it on a plate

EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING

The Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background. The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there. There's an orchard with lemon and plums to the west of the wall outside, and a green statue of a golfer further in. Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background
The boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat. He gets a text message:

       FAM: when u wanna paddle out? [PURPLE DEVIL FACE EMOJI]

       The Boy texts back: pick me up

CUT TO:

EXT. MANSION FRONT DRIVEWAY - MORNING
An old, red (a gross red. a weak red) Mazda rolls up to the front of the mansion and sputters to a stop. FAM, steps out of the car. Daps up

       FAM: Let's take one of yours

       THE BOY: Nah

       FAM: Really, mane? You want us to drive around in my car? I don't think it'll make it, honestly. It broke down at my mom's. Plus... it looks like my car

       THE BOY: Right. It's inconspicuous

       FAM: My nigga, who are you hiding from? It's not stuttin. It's your car. Why do you even care?

""...why do you even care?""

       THE BOY: Aight

INT. GARAGE - MORNING

The garage door rises to reveal Fam and The Boy's silhouette. Five cars are in the garage. There's a Tesla Model S, Silver 911, some car no one's ever seen, a Tahoe and some car under a tarp. Looks like it could be an Aston Martin. Fam smiles

       FAM (pointing to the car no one's ever seen): That one-
       THE BOY: No
       THE BOY: The Bimmer

We didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head

       FAM: Nah...nah

They get in the 911

CUT TO:

EXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY

The 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk

       SOMEONE FROM A WINDOW: I work nights, dickhead!

       FAM: I know. Fuck me, right?

Fam honks more
The Boy checks his Twitter feed. Twitter name ""You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar"" You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite. He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights
He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...
...someone tweeted ""roscoe's wetsuit""

""...what's that?""

The Boy drops ""roscoe's wetsuit"" into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it. The answer to ""what is roscoe's wetsuit?"" is...""roscoe's wetsuit"". Hilarious

SWANK, STEVE, MARCUS (Chance the Rapper), and AJ (STEFAN) walk out of the condo. They have longboards with them and they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when they see the 911

       SWANK (re: boards): How we supposed to get these in there?

       FAM: You guys take your car

       STEVE: What about your boards? Where are they?

       FAM: Can we borrow some?

They all make a face

       SWANK: We need a bigger car then. I'ma drive to your house and get the Tahoe

       THE BOY: Come on, guys. This is taking forever

       AJ: Where we going?

       FAM: Dockweiler

       MARCUS: I swam into a diaper last time

       FAM: I'm GRIMEY. I ONLY SWIM IN DIRTY WATERS! YOU KNOW THIS!

       SOMEONE AGAIN: Shut the fuck up!

Fam honks the horn

       SWANK: I'm drivin that Porsche the way back. I know that shit

Swank and Steve walk toward their car parked on the street

       THE BOY: What's ""roscoe's wetsuit"" mean?

       FAM: I don't know

They drive off

EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY

The guys carry the boards through the sand to ocean, making a strange pattern behind them

They setup camp and start changing on the beach

       MARCUS: I thought someone was bringing girls

       THE BOY: No one wants to get up this early

       MARCUS: Did you ask white girls?

       THE BOY: I asked every girl

       FAM: You a lie. You didn't ask anybody. You don't leave the house

       STEVE: Why white girls?

       MARCUS: Cause no one is getting up at 6AM to go into the freezing, dirty ass ocean, fuck up their hair-

At that moment, they all notice a girl sitting on her board in the ocean. Waiting for a wave she looks behind her. She is black

       MARCUS (CONT'D to AJ): See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me

A plane flies low overhead. (Dockweiler is right next to LAX)

       MARCUS (CONT'D) (staring at the plane)
It's gonna crush me

       SWANK (re: girl): It's like seeing a mermaid

       STEVE: Maybe it's a manatee

       MARCUS (R. Kelly): I'ma flirt

Marcus runs to the water with his board. They all follow

EXT. OCEAN - MORNING

Marcus swims up to the girl on his board

       MARCUS: Sup

       GIRL: Hi

       MARCUS: I'm Marcus
       SASHA: Sasha
       MARCUS: It's lookin alright today
       SASHA (Australian accent): Yeah. It's the only reason I'm out here
       MARCUS: Oh, you're Australian (pause) You ever seen ""Kangaroo Jack""?
       SASHA (not looking at him): Yeah
       MARCUS: Classic
       SASHA: ...wha?
       MARCUS (not mean...just serious): It's a fucking classic

Silence. Sasha is weirded out. All the guys, except The Boy, swim up

       STEVE (to Sasha. Out of breath): Hi. Did Marcus ruin it already?
       SASHA: Yes
Steve splashes Marcus
Swank takes a plastic bag with four blunts in it. He takes one out. He lights up a blunt. Talks with it hanging in his mouth

       SWANK: How long you been surfing?
       SASHA: Ten years. You?
       SWANK: Bouta month
AJ: Cops don't come out here. It's a good place to smoke. You want some?

He passes it. She takes a hit

       SWANK: What you doin tonight?
       SASHA: My friend's birthday in Santa Monica
       MARCUS: Yo, we're right around close. We're having a party tonight in a mansion. You should come. And if your friend's a girl or a guy who has weed, they should come too
       AJ: I'm Djing. I start off with Jodeci, then the switch over to 90's rap using ""Dream Lover"" to transition, play ACTUAL ATLANTA TRAP for an hour, hour and a half. Then motown, soul, and house. Girls. Go. Crazy
       SASHA: What's your DJ name?
       AJ: Twercules. no ""DJ"". Just Twercules. I got a tumblr where I post my mixes. It's getting pretty popular. I don't know. You sing? Model? Act?
       SASHA: I'ma go in

Sasha starts paddling and catches a wave into the beach

       AJ: I shouldn't have said ""bitches""
       MARCUS (thinks): ...you didn't

AJ thinks on this. This is probably saying more about him than he realizes

EXT. BEACH - MORNING
Sasha carries her board onto the beach. The Boy is sitting there

       SASHA: You goin in?
       THE BOY: Don't know yet
       SASHA: Then why'd you put on your wetsuit?

...roscoe's wetsuit


       THE BOY: Everyone else was
       SASHA: That's an awful reason

She starts walking

       THE BOY: You should come to the party. It'll be fun. (then) They invited you, right?
       SASHA: Where is it?
       THE BOY: [EDIT]. Text me [EDIT]
       SASHA: I'll remember. I'll bring some friends

She walks off

Later that day:

*******[PLAY SONG ""WORLDSTAR"" AT THIS POINT]*******

EXT. I-10 - EVENING
The guys drive down the highway eating In-N-Out. Head nods all around. Swank is now driving the Porsche. Crazily. Fam is with The Boy and the rest of the guys in the other car. Marcus drops his animal style fries on the floor

       MARCUS: Fuck
       FAM: You see you fuckin up this car?
       THE BOY: It's fine
       FAM: He's driving crazy. (iphone goes off) And he's textin me

The text says: R E C K L E S S

       FAM (CONT'D): This nigga's so lame

The Boy sees a tweet of the lead singer of a boy band tweet ""follow your heart and [HEART EMOJI] all who cross your path!"". The Boy retweets it with a [LAUGHING/CRYING EMOJI]

       FAM (CONT'D): I gotta stop somewhere first

CUT TO:

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

[VISUAL]

Fam pulls outside of a club. Lots of people are trying to get in. He and The Boy get out and walk to the bouncer, their friend CHEESE. Fam and Cheese dap. The Boy stands on the side next to a line of people trying get in VIP. They look at each other. He is not dressed appropriately to get in

Fam and Cheese do that handshake thing they do. Fam walks in

Some guys in a black SUV rolls by and yell at the dude next to The Boy

       MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch you out here Jay! Don't let me catch you!

The Boy watches this for a second. He looks down for a moment...

Someone has spray painted ""roscoe's wetsuit"" on the sidewalk. He stares at it

       MAN IN CAR (CONT'D): I got yours, muthafucka!

The Boy snaps out of it. Then takes out his phone and starts recording the fight. Fam walks out and sees the fight in action

       JAY (I GUESS?): You scared, bitch! That's why you scared!
       MAN IN CAR: I got something for yo ho-ass my nigga!

POP. POP

..what's happening?

Jay is bleeding from his stomach. The Boy is seeing this through his phone. It takes a moment for him to realize-
POP. POP
...run. now
Fam is already running. Everyone in the line is screaming and running. The Boy runs

       COP: Drop your weapon!

(these are cleaner and succinct) POP.POP.POP

Runs to the side of the building. The SUV that was firing slows down. The driver is dead. Car horn blares as the car slows to a stop, mixing with girls crying and ""oh shit!"" and ""fuck"". Jay is very close to dead. The blood on the sidewalk is almost black. A street sign (No parking between 7-9am and 4-7pm) is reflected in the dark blood. He turns to The Boy, looks around. He knows what's happening. He's leaving

That was the end. He'll never read this sentence. Or any sentence. He ended earlier. Before this sentence. As far as he knows, before any sentence. He's back to his/the natural state

The Boy felt something

It's funny, cause this dude is dead. There really isn't a connection...it's more him seeing himself for the first time since-

       SOME NIGGA: Damnnnnn.....!

       HIS FRIEND: WORLDSTAR!

The Boy's phone rings:

       THE BOY: Yeah
       FAM: Get in the car

The Boy turns and sees the car rolling up to the alley he's hiding in. The Boy runs up and jumps in. They speed off

INT. CAR - NIGHT
       FAM: That shit was NUTS!
       STEVE: I knew something was about to happen. I knew it
       MARCUS: Donnie Darko. I'm tellin you

The Boy is looking at the footage on his phone. He's got a death on video. It's looped. Over and over

The Boy touches his shearling coat...there's a hole in it. Bullet hole? He puts his finger through...

...i shouldn't be (here)

He looks at Fam and Steve. They're talking

       MARCUS (CONT'D): Bitches high heels everywhere! They ran out they shoes, cuh

       FAM: BAP! BAP! BAP! Oooow. That nigga lit up

The Boy just keeps watching the video

       FAM: Yo. You got it on video?

       THE BOY: Yeah

       FAM: Wow...you caught the end of his journey on video. That's dope. (then) We gotta pic up Doc from the jazz club

INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

Fam and The Boy Stand in the back. Doc is on stage playing saxophone with a band. He's doing a solo

       THE BOY: Does it weird you out that you almost died today?

       FAM: Not really. I'm not trippin on death

       THE BOY: I'm not trippin. I'm just sayin, if you think about it, there's no reason for us to be here

       FAM: Doc be hanging with the weirdest people. Look at these niggas. They all look like James Blake. Is that who likes Jazz now?

       THE BOY: I was thinking about it and I can't offer anyone anything. Like, my job is tweeting at people. That's my job

       FAM: That's not your job. You do it cause it's funny. You're rich. We don't have to do anything

       THE BOY: Yeah. Isn't that sad?

       FAM: Sad? We are making moves. What about that line me and Swank are gonna start selling?

       THE BOY: All we did was print shirts for ourselves. Who else is buying that shit? And the whole reason we wanted to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they were dope

       FAM: I don't know what to tell you. We are doing dope shit. We are making moves. We can do whatever we want-

       THE BOY: But none of it matters cause we're doing it for ourselves! We're just jerking off for each other. No one in the future's gonna give a shit I made a shirt once

       FAM: Then don't make a shirt, my nigga

       JAMES BLAKEY LOOKING DUDE: Shhh!

The Boy fiddles with the hole in his jacket

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

All the guys walk in with plastic bags from the grocery store. They have blue cups, alcohol, s'more fixings, and gummy bears

If I was the director, I'd have everyone walk in in slow motion into the house with ""Nosetalgia"" by Pusha T playing

Walking into bedrooms. Opening drawers. Pulling out bags of weed

CUT TO:

AJ walks into his large closet. Pulls out a bowl. There are some prescription bottles there too

CUT TO:

A naked Marcus steps out of the shower and goes in his closet and pulls out some condoms

CUT TO:

Fam is meditating in the center of his bed. He's floating off the bed by about 4 inches

I know I'll be happy anyplace anywhere I don't care
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
Anyplace is all right long as you are there

I could be happy in one little room with only a table and a chair
As happy as I'd be in a kingdom by the sea darling if you were there
And I could be rich or I could be poor in fact if you were by my side

Because I knew someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
(scat singing alternating with title)

I didn't know you got it when you left
I knew that I could take care of myself
You wouldn't be gone long, nothing could go wrong
Because I knew someday were' gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again
(scat singing alternating with title)

You just told me that your love had changed
& that's why I'd love to arrange
To see you again, I don't know when
But I do know someday we're gonna love again
Someday we're gonna love again

To the sweetness of my baby's love and care
She's candy to me, ooh ooh, sweet candy to me
She's sugar, she's spice, everything that's nice
Ooh ooh, sweet candy to me, ooh

She's got a lotta lovin' just for me
Honeydrippin' kisses that sting like a bee
Oh, candy to me, my baby's sweet candy to me
Sweeter than anything I know
You can believe I'll never let her go
'Cause she's sweet candy

Sugar plum, here I come
Sugar plum, here I come
Ooh, baby, candy to me
She's sugar, she's spice, everything that's nice
Ooh, sweet candy to me

Never use sugar in my coffee cup
One of her kisses, woo, is sweet enough
Oh, candy to me, sweet, sweet candy to me
Sweeter to me than sugar cane
In my heart, she'll always remain

250,Knock! Knock! (Who's There?),"Tears of rain
Run down my window pane
I'm on my own again
Good evening, sorrow

Sit and dream
Of how things might have been
And as I close my eyes
I get the strangest feeling

Knock, knock - ""Who's there?""
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide

Knock, knock - ""Who's there?""
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

Climb the stair
And then I say a prayer
For someone who could share
My situation

But instead
As I lay down my head
I have to leave it all
To my imagination

Knock, knock - ""Who's there?""
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide

Knock, knock - ""Who's there?""
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

Lalala lalala lalala...

Sit and dream
Of how things might have been

251,Yet...I Know (Et Pourtant),"[Verse 1]
Il pense a moi, je le vois je le sens je le sais
Et son sourire me ment pas quand il vient me chercher
Il aime bien me parler des choses qu'il a vues
Du chemin qu'il a fait et de tous ses projets
Je crois pourtant qu'il est seul et qu'il voit d'autres filles
Je ne sais pas ce qu'elles veulent ni les phrases qu'il dit
Je ne sais pas ou je suis quelque part dans sa vie
Si je compte aujourd'hui plus qu'une autre pour lui

(He thinks of me, I see it I feel it I know
And his smile does not lie to me when he comes to look for me
He likes to talk to me about things he has seen
Of the way he did and of all his projects
I believe, however, that he is alone and that he sees other girls
I do not know what they want or the sentences they say
I do not know where I am somewhere in his life
If I now count more than another for him)

[Pre-Chorus]
Il est si pres de moi pourtant je ne sais pas comment l'aimer
Lui seul peut decider qu'on se parle d'amour ou d'amitie
Moi je l'aime et je peux lui offrir ma vie
Meme s'il ne veut pas de ma vie


(It is so close to me yet I do not know how to love it
He alone can decide that we speak of love or friendship
I love him and I can offer him my life
Even if he does not want my life)

[Chorus]
Je reve de ses bras oui mais je ne sais pas comment l'aimer
Il a l'air d'hesiter entre une histoire d'amour ou d'amitie
Et je suis comme une ile en plein ocean
On dirait que mon coeur est trop grand

[Verse 2]
Rien a lui dire il sait bien que j'ai tout a donner
Rien qu'a sourire a l'attendre a vouloir le gagner
Mais qu'elles sont tristes les nuits le temps me parait long
Et je n'ai pas appris a me passer de lui

254,Soon I'll Wed My Love,"From what I have been hearing, dear, you've really got it made
Got a lot of fellers on your lover's hit parade
If I can't be your number one I don't know what I'll do
Gotta get my love up to the top, I'm so in love with you

On the hit parade of love I know I'll never stop
I've got a long, long way to climb before I reach the top
But if I do get there soon I'll really have it made
Then I'll know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade

Well, we get along, dear, like all good lovers should
Yet we could make a go of it, I know it'd turn out good
We could have so much fun, we'd really have it made
Then I'll know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade

On the hit parade of love I know I'll never stop
I've got a long, long way to climb before I reach the top
But if I do get there soon I'll really have it made
Then I know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade

Well, it's your heart I'm after, dear, 'cause you're so nice and fine
And another to replace you, dear, would sure be hard to find
So put your arms around me now and call me turtle dove
Then I know I'm number one on your hit parade of love

On the hit parade of love I know I'll never stop
I've got a long, long way to climb before I reach the top
But if I do get there soon I'll really have it made

257,It's All Over Now,"[Verse 1]
You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

[Chorus]
Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 2]
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

[Chorus]
The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 3]
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies are going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor

[Chorus]
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 4]
Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

And it's all over now, Baby Blue",Bob Dylan,1964,"[37, 26, 27, 29, 34, 40, 54, 68, 81, 100, 94, 99]",12

I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old

264,Gonna Send You Back To Walker (Gonna Send You Back To Georgia),"[Round 1: Raz]
Jay? Aye why you really took this battle?
J-A-Y if you didn't catch that you shouldn't have took this battle
But you wanted this, you wanted me to make the metal scream
If Jay sons approach I’ll grip the saw and reenact a horror scene
I’ll give ‘em two options to cross me and get X’d or assist me in your setup
And if I get word that your crew snitched or have plans to let up…
I’m holding something that’ll get more bodies wet than the summertime
And I’ll be back for you to carry out my bloody vow in time
Now that’s Scream, Jason, Saw, Exorcist, Carrie, Bloody Valentine
But I’m just getting warmed up I got more scenarios in my mind
Cause now you’re mad that I took out your crew, you’re sad and blue Jay
Bullets will fly at this bird bitch, you a Blue Jay
Think High School Musical when I pull up with two treys, them ain't food trays
Cause bullets will make your core bend, and leave you blue Jay
Aye what you got locked away safe in a safe Banks? Cash by the knots?
I don’t care if you poor or rich I’ll sneak in your house like Goldilocks
I don’t care if you there you give me a tighty whitey Fruit of the Loom feel
So if your man draws I’ll have three bare if it’s gold he locks
And since I’m leaving you wet and holy I thought about a better theme
Knowing what Ima do to you all I wanna do is pray so here’s a bible scheme
Like you know about the furnace, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?
Well I know a Trini named Shedrack who fires so much, furnace is code for calico
You say you Tiger Woods with aim well me Shaq, who got better aim and ammo ho?
Your family will know the answer by tomorrow when I dump your body in a bin 'n go
I dump cigs like Cruella when I spot bitches who think I won’t skin 'em, that’s dalmatian
You know I got niggas who keep it 101 on speed dial so that dial may shun
Any ideas you have, you claim you an animal well PETA won’t save you from this cruelty about to go down
For biting the hand that feeds you with this pound I’ll have you restrained and put down
See Jay from Brooklyn but that don’t matter cause he’s in my territory
Know some foul cons with bulldogs and hawks to get rid of shorty
I’ll come to your house and make your mom to drink brown liquor to relax her
Since she the state bird it’s only right I get the lighter and light her when the brown thrash her
Falcons, Bulldogs, Hawks, Brown Thrasher y'all don’t get that? Them Georgia lines
Ray Charles mission cause that’s how I kill with Georgia on my mind
And if your neighbors seen something they weren't suppose to I’m coming loaded with some men in black
To let metal flash before their eyes like The Men In Black
Now he sending threats so I sent a message for Jay to respond
Raz a GA native so his illegal firearm is anchored on a boat in the middle of a pond
But if he wanna cap it’ll be at land to bring to Atlanta the capital
And he’ll find you fresh out of school on your school bus to cap it all
Now he all paranoid knowing that my niggas are hiding and seeking
Flinching at every shadow while they in his window peeping
My nigga called like “he got more heat” I said I’ll send more heat then
I want to make it unfair and ambush like ‘The Last of the Mohicans’
I pulled up with cold thoughts ready to spark fire in his tepee
In all black locked and loaded like “Jay here? Where is he?”
My nigga said he was in the living room sitting in a chair a key
Was under the door I busted in with my niggas airing metal shit, Tuskegee
He tried to run so I a grabbed his shirt and tore out a patch he
Wasn't able to dance around this fire like the Apache
Cause now he on the floor bloody wishing he at least had a mag
Then I’ll tell him he’s the sacrifice as tecs come out of bags
That’s what you get for making idol threats, talk is cheap
In the end for testing a native you’ll be dumped in the creek
Translation you won’t be bulletproof when I grab the titanium that pop bitch when I see ya
Wait bulletproof, titanium, pop bitch, that’s Sia
I’m Game Boy to 3 X box you cause these barz hotter than 360 and classic like Sega Genesis cause I don't play games
For thinking you built for this I’ll aim at your spine and put two K’s on your discs like the latest NBA video games
Ironic you talk all this shit for nothing cause you are shit cause I’ll still be in the picture like a watermark
I don't have to talk shit cause there’s some shit in my house that talks for me like that episode of South Park
Shout out to the ladies tuning in but I don’t think they’ll get this next line so let me see if this sounds familiar to the dudes
Cause for this pussy I got an iron that’ll curl and leave him leaking like Jennifer Lawrence nudes
And I’m not saying I have the best performance or barz in the world, but like the Sims game they've never seen this delivery
I’ll be at your door with a ratchet in hand that’s impatient and she’ll open the door before Jay get a chance, that’s how I kill chivalry
Extended arms these cans non-perishable in case of an emergency you food Banks
I’ll make a small incision in Jay’s back and put something silver in it I’ll piggy Banks
If he told you I’m dying he lying & I’m Daniel so I could give a fuck about Jay’s den
If you bet on Jay he losing get mad at Jay den, and if we scrap he’ll be bloody he ain't no karate kid he ain't Jaden
Round 1 …

[Round 2: Raz]
You 16, so you can’t be mad when I say laughing at the thought of you busting guns was about damn near irresistible
Well since you the “hollow man” my niggas ready to ride like that Sleepy Hollow man and fuck it I got a hollow man that will leave you like the hollow man invincible
I mean really all this shit you saying you gone do to me I don’t believe, cause that ain't you Jay
Cause in your Chiraq verse, you said you wasn't hood, see that ain't cool Jay
Up in my DMs saying we’d make a match I was like LOL cool Jay
You’ll be behind my bars for your lies like Jiggy Walker on OZ, you LL Cool J
How dare he lie I know a cat who’ll bring beef holding a cal boy cause your bull I don’t buy son
If you survive the first few bullets play dead and if you get a chance grab ‘em tight cause my men tend to go overboard when they hear sirens
I’ll pull up to his honor’s day program to do his classmates, him, and his kin bad
They call me Jack Sparrow cause I have dreads and a knife that’s adventurous like Sinbad
I told my niggas to jack and don’t spare a row cause I came here to sin bad
To cause a panic I’ll cap ten in the air and hook you, I ain't come to lollygag
If your mom try to run out I’ll have bullets from the chopper chasing a bitch like Will Turner
Cause when I pull it out she won’t hesitate to run it will turn her
Pull out a big ass machete and like Davy Jones get da crackin'
Stack dead nigga on top of dead nigga like I’m bill stacking
This cannon will make you walk the plank or I’ll shoot at your body cause your body’s a vessel
For thinking you flyer I’ll throw him and his mom in the cellar to let that pair rot cause I am rebel
That’s pirate shit but I’m ready to set sail so lift the anchor
My attitude is fuck it like that black Alaskan anchor
But remember you said you were going to put me in the box in September?
Well it’s pass September but what can you do when I got the chopper chopping except timber?
But maybe I’ll spare you since your last name Banks
Cause shit I might even be able to bank off Banks
Like ..
Ring! Ring! Your mom answers her friend says some news has come up
Quick turn to channel five and turn the volume up
This just in, Raz kidnaps male for ransom identified as Jay Jay Banks
Has his favorite gun named Frankie aimed while he’s tied in constraints
Just think of that scene in Set It Off, you know after that nigga robbed the bank?
Cause even when I get my money Frankie still getting fired in Banks
But try and take that escape route thinking that you’ll get away..
Think Tyra Banks cause that pump click clacks when bitches run way
But wait I’m from the South so how about I fit the scene
And switch things up, like how about another movie scheme?
Y'all ever watched ‘Down in the Delta’? Well I keep a Beretta low I call her Loretta Sinclair
I already said I came to sin bad so that means in this murder I’m committing now I don’t want no sin clear
I’m like the boy in the movie I can’t trust Loretta she’s unpredictable
She might rise and make him go Bye Bye an he will be missing his occipital
And I relate to the boy another way cause he kept his money in a stuffed animal he must not trust Banks
Maybe I should steal money and throw him in this bag like I rob banks
Fuck it I’ll just let my niggas grabs bats and press ya
Like the little boy you’ll be left with a crack head somewhere down in the delta
You think you the shit, you ain't a problem child
Cause you bring hell to none like the Problem Child
I got a gun so big ... SIKE that’s played out, I got a guitar case though
Jay will let his guards down then like the bar scene in Desperado I’ll pull out dis pair of autos
If I feel you’re amounting to anything you’ll be left under the stars like the logo for Paramount
What I withdraw will make large deposits but that’ll be on Bank’s account for thinking he’s paramount
If you not able to dance around this fire then don’t run for the hammer you nailed Banks
You’ll be Dancing with The Stars like Alfonso Ribeiro I’ll Carlton Banks
He ain't ill nobody came here for him nobody wanna hear Jay talk
If I’m in the car and see him crossing the street my car will hit Jay anywhere Jay walk
What can you say? You’ll make the metal sing like Eddie Levert if I owe Jay
Man I’ll let you roll a bunt and take a puff and take it. Talking bout “I hit it 1st” fuck outta here this ain't no Ray J
I’ll invite you over for cards but if I lose I got something under the table that’ll turn tables that’s how I DJ
I have two pistols and that couple will pop off at your reunion to fuck shit up I’ll Joseline & Stevie Jay
Battle rap is a hunger game and to be rude his next round I should interrupt in the middle and start mocking Jay
He’s seen the first two clips but this third clip will be more anticipated than Hunger Games: Mocking Jay
When I shoot you’ll see the light but this gun ain't a flare though
I’ll put you in your tomb with this fine metal like an Egyptian pharaoh
Round 2 …

[Round 3: Raz]
Now these last two rounds I've shown how I make bullets roam and leave families hoping for new miracles when I clock with 9’s and let twelve ring like Big Ben
But for this round I stand out and show how I’m the best then cause I don’t have to put the laser beams on you like cyclops to X men
I’ll grab gasoline and torch you till you’re ash and like Jean Grey you’ll rise with wings
Or I’ll leave you blue cause I’m beast with the hands or blades will pop out of nowhere I’m Wolverine
I told you already I didn't need no guns so I don’t have to be like Magneto and trigger metal things
I’ll appear and disappear every where you look I’m the Nightcrawler and I’ll be in your mind like Professor X all in your dreams
Or I’ll get on my Storm shit cause your sister? Their gonna have to give her a cane when I twist her arm and her leg
You’ll get flipped like them Jamaicans from the movie ‘Cool Runnings’ when they were in their bobsled
And I don’t mean to preach today
But I need to do a quick battle rap PSA
Cause my mentality is if I come up with something I've heard before or that’s similar I change that shit
But some of y'all mentality is well it would sound new if I rearranged that shit
How many times will we hear the same exact wordplay senile, see now
I guess some felt it was up for grabs like I can put this in my round and this will be me now
I’m a supporter of the culture stop reusing it unless your adding to it like in my head I’m senile
I have nightmares that I've never understood but now that Jay is here it’s coming back I see now
I saw blood flowing and birds, pay attention I’m telling you my dream now
What it means? It means I have two options. I’ll sneak in his room and make it a bloody scene I’ll
Cut his throat cause I don’t buy bull and watch his DNA flow out like a bloody river it was as if I had seen Nile
You know the story about the bloody river in the bible? That was the Nile do y'all see now?
Or we can turn it into a hunting strategy like the bird in my dream I’ll
Pull up in the Chevy and have my nigga go to the door and knock, turn all lights off in the car meanwhile
I’ll have niggas across the street on the roof scoping prey from long range like they've observed and seen owl
You know hunting strategy, nocturnal, scoping prey from long range it’s like they've observed and seen owl
Now my addition to it can’t really be flipped any other way so dead it, y'all can’t recycle lines at y'all next event
But who am I kidding? Circus uni-cyclist the way y'all recycle lines every event
Battle rap is becoming weak flips and a bunch of people recycling shit that’s usually trash
Now is that a double meaning cause when you’re recycling shit it’s usually trash
But I’m off that
We have to climb stairs cause there are levels to this shit and you’re not Bruce Lee so the top you won’t get there
You’ll die like the mom from ‘What’s Eating Gilbert Grape"" for trying to take them stairs
It’s no stunner that I’m stone cold and will make you hit rock bottom like The Rock
You’ll get the Mufasa treatment cause I’ll leave any cat with pride rock
When I’m done with Banks they won’t be able to figure out on first glance this person’s identification
Cause my blade, she’s sharp minded and can help rearrange your thoughts that’s personification
You might think I’m lying and all bluff but trust me it’s all facts
It ain't a Hyperbole cause she bout that so ain't no need to hype her belee dat
You’re an asshole who talks shit that no one takes serious cause you speak tongue in cheek
And you dick ride and kiss ass when you see opportunity like you really tonguin' cheek
If I’m out to get your crew, they must be cursed cause they will be skeletons by midnight like the crew of the Black Pearl
If you say you know a chick who hold hot shit, you in ATL you must mean a Hooters girl
Already mentioned how me and my niggas would take anything you got Banks
Call me Jessie James cause I’ll be the first to rob Banks
And how your name Banks but ain't caking up?
I’ll put knots in Banks like I’m saving up
What I can bring with pen and pad trust me you don’t want Banks
I will son you and leave bloody hand prints on you like Tom Hanks
My lucky blade will be cast away after I leave you slumped
If I need my niggas they’ll just keep running and running like Forrest Gump
Cause I don’t know what love is when it comes to Jay, fuck peace I just want to fuck shit up
I said this round wasn't going to be a toy story but I’m tempted to aim at his stomach and cap ten until he feel up
I know chicks who’ll swing bats cause they’re in a league of their own
If it’s beef it’s like you've got mail in my mailbox cause I’m taking it to your home
You sentenced to these barz so walk the green mile time to get right with Jesus Mr. Banks
Anyone trying to intervene will get smacked down and get dis knee nobody saving Mr. Banks
You got cooked the first round my skills I was just starting to unearth
You were cremated the second round from fire, that’s Venus you’re in my universe
The third round I brought you back home to Earth
Earth meaning do you want your ashes in the water or dirt?",Raz,1964,"[57, 65, 72]",3
265,If I Fell,"[Intro: John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

[Bridge]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

Would love to love you
And that she will cry

I'm waitin' up, savin' all my precious time
Losin' light, I'm missin' my same old us
Before we learned our truth too late
Resigned to fate, fadin' away
So tell me, can you turn around?
I need someone to tear me down
Oh, tell me, can you turn around?
But either way

Hold me while you wait

269,Gator Tails And Monkey Ribs,"Enjoy a self inflicted ""Vulcan Shocker""
Live long and prosper and do so with honor

But don't expect these prowlers with katanas to sponsor
(we're) too busy vexing karma to worry 'bout Beyonders

Sitting in a lawn chair, conjuring lava, Ala Kazam
Slam you on spikes, the dip in a Honda

Fitted with rocket launcher that only fires boxes of condoms
Laminate your johnsons

'cause any offspring calling your father is fodder
I'm Darth Vader in gators, you're ice skaters in otter

Facial expressions are lookin bothered at your concerts
Claiming that you got work, your weight needs spotters

On my collarbones are the mass of the throne
And I'm draped in australian koala fur, proper

Philosophers, sit back and chit chat
I'm in the world, trying to remix facts to get stacks, Holler

Chorus x 2
I'm skating on thin ice
Flying with broken wings
And rollin wit trick dice

I'm making that big heist
Gripping God's coat tails
Making 'em flip twice

You can catch me pissin in the aquifer
Your mama lookin like Chewbacca mixed with Gossamer
You feel popular

'cause a Twitter follower swallowed ya
Giving you gonorrhea and cholera
Now wallow with the commoners

Monkey ass rappers need to change zip codes
Underwear, and shitty monikers
And get a new plan from guidance counselors

And follow ups, catch me in the parking lot
Fondling a model, windows fogging up
Cheers

Tall dark beers, you cloggin up ears with your hogwash
Resembling a wizard from hogwarts

Stalwarts think it's all mapped out
Get your heart snatched out then passed 'round
Wrong fork-prong on the map route

Raw short songs when I black out
Concussive forces, crush it snort it, record it

Reported, live from the barracks
Mac 'n' cheese, chicken, and spare ribs
Marvel at the cut of the rare jib

Chorus",Illingsworth,1964,[96],1
270,Sally Was A Good Old Girl,"[Verse 1]
Sally used to carry my books to school
Sally was a good ole girl
Helped me with my homework because I was a fool
Because Sally was a good ole girl
If you wanted just a kiss or a little bitty squeeze
She was always willing to do her best to please
Yeah, girls were made to love and not made to tease
Sally was a good ole girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl

[Verse 2]
Oh well, Sally's folks were poor but she helped all she could
Sally was a good ole girl
Hardest working girl in the neighborhood
Sally was a good ole girl
Well, she walked up and down the street all day
Selling neck ties to the one's who'd pay
If they couldn't afford it then she'd give them away
Because Sally was a good ole girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl
Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl

[Verse 3]
Well, Sally was a favorite with all of the men
Because Sally was a good ole girl
All of the ladies despised her then
Because Sally was a good ole girl
Well, the women talked about her
But Sally didn't care
She kept on a working and a doing her share
She wound up married to a millionaire
Sally was a good ole girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl
Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best

I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

How do you do what you do to me?
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue

273,Walk-Don't Run '64,"[Vocal Layer 1: Canibus]
I got bored with 4 beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
You'll see I'm not behind them or in front of them, I'm one of them
Started with a 100, the Game spit 3, I said, ""Fuck it
I'ma have to show these niggas something""
Too easy, who'd believe me if I said that it wasn't?
The rhyme is a weapon, I bust it, the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward, sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as A.G.C.R
The rhymes are raw, deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didn't think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport, I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is 'The Greatest Rhyme of All Time' supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy, not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said, ""Nobody benefits, everyone perishes""
I tell them this, they say, ""Here, it's time for your medicine""
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to '44 4's' 22 times
'I Gave You Power', God stop my heart if I'm lying
You like red or white wine? Let's talk about it I'm buying
Let's talk about the Children of Zion, excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming? I've mastered it certainly, surely
I'll celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder, searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it don't coagulate
The sex magik won't work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud nine, look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis, a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners, Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics, notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of GermaineFather Author Poor Pauper Pastor, more than a rapper
My body is a human machine, my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour, then a taser, then a laser
Then a maser, then a phaser, then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why? Coup de grâce for the coup d'État
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think I've had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off, I promise you we'll just talk
No biting allowed, just bark, don't run, just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought, thought manifests words, actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me, you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
I'm a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself, then how would I be?
If I do not look tell me how will I see?
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still can't recognize myself
I don't need anybody but myself
When I'm rhyming like this I don't need no help
But, thank you for your purchase, these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious, the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy, you wanna be the best, you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield E&D Fields
Chew MCs like I'm eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas' with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
It's no use if you can't use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone number's placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it, I don't wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens wide mattress she's an actress
This is Monster Ball practice, I'm Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I don't care if we're not the same colour, nigga I'm your brother
I don't care what you say nigga, you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind, waves, bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I don't care if I make history, I wanna be a part of infinity
Look at what your Sun god did to me
I am energy, I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans, more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers, rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live, earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing, where are you? Are you hiding?
No! I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so? Tell the people, they need to know
And if you don't think so, you're a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say I'm crazy, I say ""So, tell me something I don't know
Something my psyche profile doesn't show""
I don't have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus? Answer me!
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit, they don't like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Pole's longest Ice Strait
Food supply low, they speak of going above ground to find mo'
I cry out, ""No, do not go!
Where the fuck are you going?
400mph wind belts blowing, think for a moment
We got to wait it out, that's what the training's about""
We have to survive, that's what Germaine is about
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies, follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage, battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hops trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking, water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan, laughing
Tough, pliable, relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I can't rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship, that hasn't been made yet
'Cause I haven't been paid yet, not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating, I tried to save them, they wasn't patient
Responsibility entrusted
There's only one way for me to prove that I love it, that's why I'm busting
If you pursue revenge, dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that you've made
Musically still producing, I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureate's my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it, concentrate you can hear it
I've almost perfected this, I'm one word away from excellence
When I find it I'll begin testing it
The phenomenal beast, astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness, I'm bout to show you
Who wildebeest Williams is, you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic, it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes
The minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit, from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity, listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder, created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than China's
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
A primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity, Number 2 is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember, meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you can't forget
Oprah Winfrey don't like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably don't like black
I don't blame her, she don't understand it's only entertainment
She probably wouldn't feel different if she wasn't famous
She traded places and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist, if not racist with colour?
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion, the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon, not the sigil, this is for real though
I sit down and think, when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God, even I'm stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead, that's not fair
Who I talk to? Go he there, Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically

Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history

[Vocal Layer 2: Canibus]
I procured a small piece of the treasure, collections from a former era
Dating back to forever, the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law, I don't govern them
I summon them, speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet, woodwinds, strings
The conductor brings the drums in, finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance, Hip Hop justice, rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered, liars are denied water, you still alive?
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule, let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary, patrolling the open seas at U-Boat speed
Beneath the Tsunami, where I'm supposed to be
Industrialists, civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs, aristocrats in the buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
400 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
Co-signed by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding, lyrics, timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding, so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open, a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me, it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously, talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it, it's going to have a word with me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made, field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate
Eliminate the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this, there's no challenge
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieri's Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit who's ready?
I'll need a volunteer, do I have any?
Next year I'll get my SPINGS, a master space badge
After that I'll stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devil's chamber
""That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die""
The leaders lies got me reassigned, my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
I'm a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
We'll shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like there's a bus up the street
The Dr. and I would meet at 29 palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health, killing myself
Rebuilding myself, nobody feel what I felt
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill, getting more ill
The woman who is there, she will take care of you
With Nexium, Avodart, Lipitor, and Theraflu
Rap music profession immunosuppressants
One question per second, One answer per session
Hip Hop made me, Hip Hop praise me
Ain't nothing changed me since 1980
Involuntary catalepsy, battle me baby
1000 Bars nigga, after that maybe
Murder, murder, murder, kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill, but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians, I do it for the soldiers
Raptors, Comanches, Strykers, Cobras
Back at the TOC with G.W. Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit 'til the story is told
It's a gift, this story is a part of my soul
We shouldn't keep fighting, the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth, then where we gon' go?
Starving in destitution, dying for retribution
Why would you wanna' blow a hospital? You stupid?
Why would you not force yourself to make better music?
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
Like something harder than Tungsten, break your arm if you punch it
I ride on a flatbed chariot, 4 ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter, the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor, ""I see excitement coming""
I raise my hand, lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming, I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied, I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say we're divided, I say we're small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance, the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities
7.83 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the observatory summit of Mt. Graham
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic, ultra, electro, and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
You cannot comfort me like my poems
1000 BARS put me in the zone
The Pope shook, they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute, I would like to propose this next toast
To maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary, but tell me who's the beneficiary
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary?
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when I'm touring
Acupuncture point or plus, is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute, or debate
My face, is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing, from the other side it looks like it's opening
Where am I trying to go with this?
Fire and Ash fallout, that's what it's all about
We must construct a shelter, and then build a wall around it
All the parents want to do is look at the body but
It won't happen 'til AFTER the official autopsy
A good psychological environment for science
I'm memorizing visualizing peace and quiet
Father Author Poor Pauper has poor posture
As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
But I'm unprepared to take action just like you
The innate need for Canibus to be professional
Make it difficult indeed for me to connect with you
Greetings and salutations, my equations are inundated with information
Electro cranial stimulation
Burn skin off face, burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofing remediation
Any and ALL entry points have immigration
One meter beside the Hubble outside the bubble, the effects of gravity on my
Muscles were quite subtle
I do what I want to do, I have always been that way
Because I have always thinked that way
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer
Poet Laureate is the future
Pulsating lights and sounds surrounds spirits
Binaural Beats, layered underneath lyrics
250 thousand cycles per second, for Dolphin hearing
The electrical optical coupling Gear is effective
88 Kilometres above the planet
My rhymes harness a power beyond your understanding
The Gods began to call me, I looked up
Stars fell towards me and scorched me to a metaphor freak
The authentic Command Doctrine of George Washington
Himself, GW I'm positive it's him
I proof read my writtens, eat a chicken with the skin missing
Spend the whole night out binge drinking
Executive Director of Civic Participation spitting
First it was vote or die, Now it's don't vote, Why?
Weed is now legalized are you high?
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates
Be my guest keep trying
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt
But not before I start cursing first
Not so fast Mr. Iconoclast
If you don't leave the bottle outside you can't pass
Gather the evidence, then give it to the President
Don't reprimand him, ask him for help next, 190
A lamp with no electrode will not glow
We need some new bright ideas that we did not know
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You must take prudent and precautionary measures
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I can't wait to sign an autograph for the last time
A Luciferian web, everyday we are burying dead
Every colour in America bled
Empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
You'll never reach the end of it, 200
Fire and forget, rhyme for respect
I didn't get that so I wrote Poet Laureate
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter, why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause I'm familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said, let it be written, let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically

Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This never been done before in history

[Vocal Layer 3]
I spit at a thousand KIPS, kilo tons of pressure
Every letter is measured in such a way you will remember
December, 21st 2012 is the code
It was placed on the sunstone to puzzle them
Starting with some numbers, the code crackers start crunching
I better have some results by the months end
Really, Deep Blue computes deeply and does it
What is the answer to Universe? Read me the numbers
In the summer the Polar Manitoba's melted by lava
A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull
I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls
The Rear Admirable participated in battle every war, and at least half of my
Crew were injured every tour
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force would give us
All what we needed, we were wrong
Canibus is notably known Globally
My verbal sorcery somehow talks to the beat
Lyrically you not ready, dress right dress
Not messy, my muscle memory make me bomb squad steady
You can't contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes, ears, nose & throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime chakra one thru nine
Thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
Recite 33 3's 33 times
For 24hrs, 21 thousand Nautical miles
Ahead of my lifetime I write and recite rhymes
Deja Vu in the booth is the truth, when you apply it
Devine design, a miracle of Metallurgy
Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
From the shores of Normandy to the Turkish streets
To the bluest oceans glowing on the Persian beach
Nuclear Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate, the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back, my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
As I co-create rap, 30
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets, I attack it
Access then egress then quit this rap shit
Commander of the symphony when man meets ministry
Finishing my Archeogenetic Rap Facility
They can't battle me so they'd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me they commit microphone heresy
I am still the Master
As handsome as my unborn Grandson, Rip The Jacker
Call me grandpa, 40 as odd as it may seem
The microphone fiend is God of the Hip Hop regime
Planet Rock Supreme
Kill you with green Lasers, evaporated weed vapour, Electromagnetic Scalar
Then something they call a Maser
""That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die""
Meteors fall from the sky, The Mars God looks at my eyes
Controlling my heart, controlling my mind
Oh Lord, Tell me what to do, Tell me oh Lord
I have mastered the art of rhyming I am so bored
My pain my joy my thoughts I've passed them on thru songs
Respond to me and I will answer to your call
Emotion manifests Thought, Thought manifests Words Actions & Reality
That's how it has to be
In front of me, on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me, 60
Sitting down at the mixing board/round/banquet table comfortably
They begin to study me, by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely, I rose & I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell
Metaphoric Sun Worship, pulling me with planet like inertias
Words blinking like the text edit cursor
My sentences are sometimes too sensitive to make sense of it
Layer upon layer upon layer unedited
You lazy & you wanna' be the best? You crazy!
The Best Train EVERYDAY of the week
Propulsion system is gravity driven, white hot thermal
External vision, every lyric got a wormhole in it
Saint Germaine is real, Germaine is a sage for real

A true master at the masters in focus
In my time of need, I am not alone
I was told in a dream by Cthulhu from his tomb

Made your life purposeful, germinated the earth with you
My black goggles, are covered with Bat Guano
I'll hang from the ceiling and watch you, act hostile I'll pop you

I don't want nothing from you, not even your judgement
The Philosophic maverick the massive knowledge magnet
Underwater sea lilies are the source of my magic
Matricidal motherfucker homicidal hustler
Filibuster, never been a Wikipedia lover
If I were you I wouldn't waste time reading that rubbish
It might turn you into a media puppet, but fuck it
Leviathan divides the suspect zero sign
Therefore I rhyme for all time
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
But poetry continues outside the timeline
Unnatural battle ability, the enemy tried to imprison me
But they would've been better off killing me
Theoretically Shiaperrelli has mentored me
With motifs of illuminated speech and wizardry
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
Sound pours out of the ground across the land
Jethro Tull was mauled by the god called Pan
Creative writing and rhythm, grammar and composition
Don't ignore me, ignore the fool who tells you not to listen
To you it shouldn't sound like I'm quitting cause I'm not
If I am to continue it's up to Hip Hop
Weary of body and mind, tired of swimming against the tide
Why swim or walk when I can glide?
Zero Gravity exercising, requires expert timing, for sky diving
My call sign is Flying Wing
An impossible profession

Why do it for free when I'm worth my weight in gold?
Mind Body & Soul inseparable, incredibly
Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually
Hip Hop became boring, lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ
But they should be more important
The diaphragm, the thymus
Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras
You get the Guantanamo Bay, the Alcatraz way
You heard what I say? These pigs gotta' pay!
I steady my approach, this supposed to be a no fly zone
Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes
The hurricane's eye's open
Gale winds blowing, Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean
I figured out, how to save water in a drought
If we save the right amount I know we can make it out
The ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy?
The quantum biology biopsy
My austere designs are so ahead of their time
Even when you press rewind your still left behind
Father Author Poor Pauper, breaths to draw Prana
In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama
Your ear cartilage has been targeted, The bombing will commence
Don't be a bitch nigga you started it
On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet
Drawing mathematics, suspended in space as holographics
Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal
Viable style it's like trying to ride a bull
The lyrical inimical is miserable because I've built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Am I a mad man or a mason? A patriot or a pagan?
West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons
The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated
I'm waiting on the parts special order replacements
Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment
Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites, Fuck all the haters
My luck was crushed, I felt like they fronted
My heart kept pumping, I had to do something
I turned the page, wrote a turn of phrase
Verbal X-Rays, they say ""I don't burn I blaze""
Don't look at it like winning or losing, in '98 it was amusing
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit!
Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping
But right now my image stands still in a prism
My light reflects like a mirror, I choose to share it
The Precession of Earth is nearing, I'm preparing
Assessment and Planning things, should I put mustard on these sandwiches, a
Fathers job is so challenging
My pupil size increase, constriction and velocity decrease
You can't Emcee take a seat
What are you building Bis? Is it a flying Silver Disk?
If you ever leave you'll be missed
I tear thru the Galactic drift, I travel 10 digits in 10 minutes
Now that's some shit! You think that's fast? Nah....
That's faster than you think, By the time you blink, the whole Universe shrinks
A word to the wise, try to keep your eyes in the skies
And try to keep your ears on my rhymes
A magic reminder that the fire will not expire
Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when I'm tired
The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt, I'm forced to look downward
Now I see inside the Earth
I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass
But it won't last we're killing her with greenhouse gas
You said ""the best shouldn't have to ask for respect""
Is that correct? Yes could you please speak up, I SAID YES!
I hold Hip Hop responsible
Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles
Gone 'til November? I'll be gone forever
I made these bars so you could ALL remember
The illest MC to put it all on the line
My career was crucified but I'm still alive
Sky scraper spaceships, wide crater dry lake beds
""resistance is futile"" they said
I bear clutch the pen, my girlfriends jealous again
So intimate when I write it's a sin, 200
My electromagnetic rap flytrap
There's no way Earth you can get around that
This is a no brainer, stop the complaining
If Hip Hop is dead I'm here to save it
Pages upon pages everything I've created
The bar was below basic, I had to raise it
I did it for my Fathers, I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
My poetry is peaceful, aggressive but regal
Progressive to the people, I hope the words reach you 210

Nobody do it better, there ain't a truer Ripper

Inspired by GOD, inspired by the suffering
Was it done by a prophet? It must have been, who was it then
Rip The Jacker, hot but cold blooded

274,Sweet William,"[Verse 1]
I was born with this story, it's older than I
And yet, you, when you hear, it you'll know in the sky
In the wind of your knowledge, in the cut of your jib
That the fibre of wind is as new from my lip

[Refrain 1]
As was ever and more and ever will be
Till the union we face casts us finally free

[Chorus]
For we, in the love of an earth-bidden dance
Stand enthralled of that, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of sweet William's

Embrace...

[Verse 2]
William's wanderings took him abroad
Showed him the lay of the searcher's long road
To the place he stood now 'neath the black laden sky
And the crook of his father had brought fortune nigh

[Refrain 2]
Read the sign where he looked; not the bull, nor the bear
Nor a burly red lion, or the tortoise and hare

[Chorus 1]
For we, in the love of an earth-bidden dance
Stand enthralled of that, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of sweet William's

Embrace...

[Refrain 3]
The end of the world was the name of the inn
Said fair William, ""Farewell, to the world and its sin""
Its sin...

[Verse 3]
Full balmy was the winter air, all wet with what might die
A wishing well, the ocean bare, a millpond in his eyes
A glance to see from whence he came, for William, with a landlocked turn
Vermin what he stood to lose, the skin-shot snakes and earthy worms

[Verse 4]
His boots trod soft inside the inn, he's greeted all was here
Abrasive lowly nods came back, then bent toward their beer
""They must know I,"" thought Willy now, ""They've seen me come from miles""
The thought was struck as whisky poured and barmen gave all smiles

[Bridge]
Then followed this, a curious thing
The eldest of the host
Sang softly where he sat and drank
To love, a worthy toast

His song was of a stranger
Summoned for his rope
In all would be to set us free
His song was strong and bold, it went

[Chorus 2]
We, in the love of an earth-bidden dance
Stand enthralled of that, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of sweet William's

Embrace...

[Verse 1]
I was born with this story, it's older than I
And yet you when you hear it you'll know in the sky
In the wind of your knowledge, in the cut of your jib
That the fibre of wind is as new from my lip

275,Worry,"[Verse 1: John Martin]
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

[Bridge: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Hook: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

[Verse 2: John Martin]
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend

[Bridge: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Hook: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child

Don't you worry, don't you worry now

I knew I never can explain
Darling I heard
The angels sing, when you loved me
But now all the stars
Are back in the skies
I sent you away

279,I Stand Accused,"[Intro]
Pardon me.  Can I have a word with you for a few minutes?
Sit down, get comfortable
Uhhh, how long have we known each other? About 10 months? Yeah I think its, yeah. You and John are real tight aren’t ya?
Yeah.  Oh is that an engagement ring?
Awww, congratulations
Oh he slipped it on your finger last night huh?
He’s the luckiest man in the world, you know, he should be real proud to have someone like you
Oh yeah, umm, what I wanted to talk to you about is, well, there is something that has been bugging me for about 5 months and I’ve been carrying it around with me and it’s getting heavier and heavier everyday…
And, uh, yeah it’s almost to the boiling point and I have to get it off my chest
Yeah, I’m not trying to be fresh or anything, because I know you're John’s girl, but I just have to tell you this
You see I have a great deal of respect for you…I’m not being, you know, not going left field on you …but dig

You see I’m gonna take you back to my childhood for a minute….We had quite a big family and we weren’t very rich, sometimes we lived from day-to-day
But one thing we did do was go to church every Sunday.  Mama took us to church, and I was in the choir too, hey yeah I sang a little bit in Sunday school
She taught us the golden rules, the 10 commandments, and she said, “Son do onto others as you have them do onto you”, she said “Don’t steal” “Don’t rob” You know all the things good parents try to instil into their children
Well you know I did a few little things like shoot hook, I guess every kid shoots hooky at least once
And umm, she said “Stay out of trouble” You know when I was a teenager I didn’t break in, burglarize, or rob anybody
I tried to work for what I got, you know, tried to be honest.  Didn’t commit no crimes or nothing, but you know I had to wait,  huh ’til I reached manhood to commit a crime, according to the court of love, if there is such a court
But you know….sometimes you’re forced into things like this, see sometimes Cupid can shoot his arrow so fast you can’t get out the way, you know?
And you can fall and the more you, it’s like being in quicksand too, the more you wiggle the deeper you sink

I’m not gonna take up too much of your time, you see I’m not very good with words and I had to tell you all of that, so I can really say what I got to say
See there is a lot of talk going around town that I’m on the make for John’s girl, “Ike’s on the make for John’s girl”.  I don’t mean to do anybody wrong because I wouldn’t want anybody to bother anything that belongs to me
But you see I’ve never seen anybody like you, I’ve never known anybody like you, and there’s some things you just can’t help.  At night I toss and turn, I try to keep it out my mind but you see….I find myself thinking about you
I just can’t help it, and right now……

I stand accused
Of lovin' you too much
And I hope, I hope it's not a crime
'Cause if it is, I'm guilty
Of lovin' you, you, you

I, I hope to God
That I never have, oh, to testify
'Cause if I do
Everyone is gonna, they're gonna cry
They're gonna say
Old Ike is guilty
Of lovin' a sweet girl like you

I know, I know
You belong to another
I, I may not stand a ghost of a chance
I'll stand on top of Mount Everest
And proudly tell the world that I love ya
Oh yes, I will

Because I, I just can't
I can't help myself
I'm a victim of circumstance

And just one
Ooh, one touch of your hand
I don't know how it happened
But just look at me
I find myself chillin'
On the witness stand

And I'm shoutin' out
All over, all over the land
Everybody, I'm guilty
I'm guilty of lovin', lovin' you

I'm guilty of lovin' you
I said, I'm guilty
But what can I do?
I wanna hold ya
I wanna squeeze ya tight
But my mind said
She belong to another
And that ain't right

(Album version cont.)
...
I didn't ask to fall in love with you
I just couldn't help myself
And now I'm strung out
Don't know what to do, no, no, no
I'm guilty
Of lovin' you
Oh yeah, I'm guilty, of lovin' you
I'm not ashamed to say I love you, I love you, I love you
I can't help but, I just can't help but.. love you
And I'm guilty baby
Oh I'm guilty
I know you belong to another
But I can't help, I can't help but love you
Oh yes I do
I stand accused of loving you
Baby, baby, baby
Please, can't you understand, the situation that I'm in
That's ~a~ one side of love, man",Isaac Hayes,1964,"[66, 61, 62, 72, 80, 84]",6
280,Sincerely,"[Verse 1]
I'm calling this the love crusade
The truth is like a black bouquet
Money's got us all enslaved
The bullets and the bombs we make, oh, no
It doesn't have to be this way
But I promise it'll stay this way
If you would rather hear me say
That everything is all okay
I don't care for your drugs, I don't care for your fame
Do you care for the truth if you're not entertained?
I can see through your eyes, I can see through your pain
And you're scared to admit, you feel out of place

[Chorus]
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, the world looks perfect from a plane
A couple miles up and we all look the same
One love tryna show us the way
One love that is trying to change
And if we connect with that, then we should be enraged
These fat cats want us lost in the maze
And they're scared 'cause we're breaking the chain
They're scared 'cause we're 'bout to escape

[Chorus]
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely

[Bridge]
There's a billion people
That could use a hero
Come together, we're the tether
Of this love that's spinning 'round
We could be that miracle

[Chorus]
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love

281,Lovers Always Forgive,"[Verse 1]
I think I'm almost happy here
But I will never regret venturing despite fear
Because everyone wanted me to see that we could not thrive
So if this is reality
Then I guess I don't regret the nights I thought that I had died
'Cause sometimes I feel like nothing, and nothing ever changes
When changes consume me through these changing stages
Everything we could have done differently is now just a memory
And the love I hoped for is hanging on a rope
And it's funny how artistic we become when our hearts are broken
Through this constant collapse, the thought of relapse

[Chorus]
I guess it's safe to throw our bones back in the sea
I guess it's safe to throw our bones back in the sea

[Verse 2]
With this saltwater for blood and fear of falling in love
I'm almost happy here, but I'm still moving
I just want us to run wild, young beauty
Because I always thought I would be okay
And some days, I still feel the same
But every day the same way I feel afraid to embrace grace
'Cause I know I don't deserve it
And I know that I can't earn this
And I know that I can hurt this heart that I have grown within
But it's a given to even someone as sick as me
Now I can breathe seeing that I'm not living in apathy

[Chorus]
So I guess we'll throw our bones back into the sea
I guess it's safe to throw our bones back into the sea

[Verse 3]
Come with me and I hope I stay alive
Because ghosts can't love through this broke love
And turn to above in a quick dash
Feel the impact on this car crash, and pray to God I can be forgiven
And have my friends back
Where we sleep is where we dream, and I haven't slept for days
REM cycles are a memory of when I was sitting in a dorm room
Thinking of how much greener the grass would be
If I became a touring act someday
But now I'm dreaming or sinking
Most nights they feel the same, since I can lose one friend
Lose all friends, and still not keep those demons at bay
And I said all my friends are trees with the roots in the earth
What hurts is that the branches in a community
We've labeled our hearts into a collective scene
Into a collective faithless dream
Of empty courage and empty hearts
Hollow light, hollow lovers, always falling apart
So I'll love life and let go
And try my best to understand there's nothing new to know
Though I didn't say it's true, I still feel the same
Like I died with you, and I feel the strain
Taking two steps back on these wooden floorboards
I'll beg for more, and pray this isn't just a retrospective moment
Not just a soul begging for catharsis
But rather the start of a new me and a real movement

In my heyday, I probably put the product in my sock

This is AA, back up in the trunk with the AK

Coke chemists taste the flow, it's numb, needs copper rum
Blunting off the get back, salute me then one, I'm out
Off to the races, my blazers ain't patient
They want to spray shit, get elephant blown for stalking Rae shit
Jammies carry nitrogen, light up a section like I'm on Vicodin

Scripting it, record it, fans then applaud it

Standing neath the moon above

He said
""Me Japanese Boy, I love you, I do love you
You Japanese Girl, you love me please say you do""

They carved their names on an cherry tree
Just like they've done in Japan since time began
Then he gently held her hand
And said
""Me Japaneses Boy, I love you, I do love you
You Japaneses Girl, you love me, please say you do""

In a blue and white Kimono
She became his happy bride
From that day until this very moment
She'd been standing by his side

Now they are old and from what I am told
They're still in love just as much as they once were
Every night he kissed her and said

""Me Japanese Boy, I love you, I do love you""

We make no sounds
We slip up they might come around
No fight
No flight
We freeze on sight
A breezy night tonight
We might just die
If we're not silent
Timing just right when I light it
Stalk like a lion
Talkin' for mindless
Walk a thin line
This is how we pass the time


[Verse 1]
Run mother fucka' run
No sunlight to save you
Fun times before the strike came
And death is imminent
And I'm petrified a little bit
Destined to be dead
In my bed where I rest
The test I guess
Never expected less
Probably a pessimist
At a time like this

Cold as I write this
Soul is ice I roll the dice
Come out alive if not we tried
Everything that we could
But it wasn't effective
Maybe a different direction
We're nothing if we can't protect them
Maybe we're worthless
Maybe we're searchin'
For the wrong answers
Wipe the canvas
I can hear them in the forest
Roaring their chorus
Sound the siren no place to hide in sight

[Chorus]
I come from a quiet place
We make no sounds
We slip up they might come around
No fight
No flight
We freeze on sight

Bitch how many bodies you got, hmm?
Shut yo dumb ass up

[Verse]
I ain’t scared of no bitch, I ain’t scared of Cuban either
Raps got y’all fooled, I know she ain’t no shooter either
Bitch thought it was sweet, till I caught her outta hell shit
Bitches was bout to run, and I still ain’t get my nails fixed
Fuck it
I’ll be broke, but y’all bitches don’t sell shit
Knew you hoes was weak
Jump in some beef so how you scared bitch
It’s the real B
And I ain’t come to play around this bitch
You in Detroit, I’m on yo ass
Y’all can’t stay around this bitch
I got a shooter with a drum
And I keep his ass on stand by
Bitches playing dirty then they mans die
These hoes be talking, I can beat em with my hands tied
Bitch ain’t have no hands, even her mans ain’t even swing by
Bitch ain’t got no friends, even yo mans know you can’t swing Ma
Fucked a couple rappers, now she think she the man huh
Was sending threats to Asian, how you geeked cause she yo friend now
Got fucked by Kodak Black, but you ain’t got a Benz now
Make that bitch get on her knees, Tadoe blacked her eyes
You was dick sucking Molly, now she ain’t on yo side
Came out the stu and felt these hands, bitch I’m hurting yo pride
Lil bitch was playing tough, till I caught her outside
So all that draco, cut it
You keep telling me lies
Every bitch I’m with would’ve dogged every one of yo guys
Had my hung with both hands, you couldn’t swing if you tried
How you fronting like you won, bitch we all know you lying
Why these hoes don’t model, cause they funny rappping
I got boo’d in my city, cause they funny acting
Everybody outside know what really happened
These bitches soft to sum it up, this what really happened
Joseph begging Natashia to pull me off of you
The bitch you came with ain’t even bust a move
So if we jumped
Shoot, yo mans was right in front of you
You should be dissing her not me, but that’s what dummies do
Was looking for that chain, cause that bitch was coming off of you
Next time you know to shield, or this shit is off of you
If you busy winning, how the fuck you know what I can do
You are not a street bitch, you are just a prostitute
You ain’t hurt nobody, shit I knocked the lashes off of you
Bitches want some smoke
Shit, I knocked the ashes off of you
I’m a find out who yo writer is and smack that nigga
Same reason why a bitch always rapping niggas
Joseph’s pussy ass was shooked
My bitches should’ve grab that nigga
I ain’t surprised, same reason why I laugh at niggas
They just hate I’m in my bag though
My young niggas say I’m acting like a asshole
Couple niggas switch, tell I ain’t mad though
Praying on my downfall, but still ain’t got a bag though
And these bitches ain’t got shit coming
Only time a bitch is nice is when the bitch cumming
And they be stalking my life, but swear a bitch nothing
And they be talking bout ice, as if that means something
Lil bitch get yo shit snatched
And we ain’t lacking over here, get yo shit smacked

Because she can't keep her foot off the accelerator

Living in this misery, darling
You can't make my life all over

Honey, but don't you let that be no problem
Just come on home and help me solve it
Dear, I won't be missing you, I won't be missing you
And my lover's prayer would be all over
It got to be all over, honey, all over

Don't keep my life going round in so many circles

315,I Get Around,"[Intro: Shock G & 2Pac]
Round and round (aw yeah)
Round and round, round we go (I get around)
Round and round
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Round and round, round we go (stronger than ever)
Round and round

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

[Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac]
What you mean you don't know?
Round and round, around we go
I get around, the Underground just don't stop for hoes
Round and round
I get around, still down with the Underground
Round and round, around we go
I get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Round and round

[Verse 2: Shock G & Money B]
Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents (a dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

[Verse 3: Money B & Shock G]
What's up, love? How you doin'? (all right)
Well, I've been hangin', sangin' tryna do my thang, oh, you heard that I was bangin'
Your homegirl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't (uhh)
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around

[Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac]
Round and round, around we go
2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Round and round
Round and round, around we go
Why I ain't call you? Hahahah, please!
Round and round

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Finger tips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone, why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real G's doin' time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around

[Outro: Shock G]
Round and round, around we go
Round and round, around we go, uhh
Round and round, around we go
Round and round, around we go

I'ma eat you like studio cookies, oh
You ain't dealin' with a rookie (Rookie)
But I'm fresher than a fuckin' rookie, oh
You be in Jersey like you Snookie (Snookie, Snookie)

[Intro: Romeo Santos]
Sentimiento, mami
¡Aventura!

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Hasta en mi sueño tus deseos intenté de complacer
Por ti la luna alcancé
Y en mi jornada un angelito me encontré
Me vio muy triste, supo que perdí la fe
En mi sueño no vi un rostro, solo lo escuchaba hablar
Me daba cátedra de amor y al escuchar
Ansiosamente le empezaba a reclamar
¿Cuál es la clave para que me puedas amar?

[Pre-Coro: Romeo Santos]
Primero me dijo que es un pecado pensar solo en ti
Segundo que no puedo ni debo aunque quiero dar la vida por ti
Tercero que mi destino en el amor corre peligro, me advierte de ti
Y cuarto que un esclavo en el amor, le pisotean el corazón
Que aquel que ama pero no demuestra to' el cariño se prepara para un desliz

[Coro: Judy Santos]
El amor es lo más raro que ha podido existir
Quien de ti se enamoró, lo más probable ni le pones atención
Y otra persona le das una flor, una poesía, entregas tu corazón
Y si ocurre una desilusión, pierdes la esencia y la fe en el amor

[Post-Coro: Romeo Santos]
Esta noche quiero volver a soñar
A ver si aprendo algo más
Y que me salga ese angelito tan divino
Que me ha venido aconsejar

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
It's only a dream, Romeo...
Wake up

A fool am I, a fool am I, in love

Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN

ANTONIO
Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you?

SEBASTIAN
By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.

ANTONIO
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.

SEBASTIAN
No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
me in manners the rather to express myself. You
must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
which I called Roderigo. My father was that
Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
for some hour before you took me from the breach of
the sea was my sister drowned.

ANTONIO
Alas the day!

SEBASTIAN
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
though I could not with such estimable wonder
overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again
with more.

ANTONIO
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

SEBASTIAN
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.

ANTONIO
If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
Your servant.

SEBASTIAN
If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.

Exit

ANTONIO
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
Else would I very shortly see thee there.
But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.

É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through

It means so much to be a part
Of a heart of a wonderful one
When other lovers are gone
We'll live on, we'll live on

Even in my dreams I look into your eyes
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through

Nobody I know could love me more than you
You can give me so much love it seems untrue
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
And then when you've heard him see if you agree
Nobody I know could love you more than me
Nobody I know could love you more than me",Peter & Gordon,1964,"[41, 25, 15, 12, 14, 15, 23, 48, 73]",9

The most decent thing you sayin', that you had me at a greeting
Our first sight is noted as a maiden flight
Not even worried, what's done in the dark will come to the light

I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted

I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my ""grant it"" though for granted

No, solo Dio sa, troverò lavoro nell'aldilà
Non andrò mai in galera, non andrò mai in galera

[Strofa 1: Wayne Santana]
Sto correndo veloce come una gazzella
Ho le guardie dietro, ho detto: ""Tony accelera""
Fottute guardie, fottuta cella
Ho una canna d’erba da due grammi accesa
Passala a noi oppure passala a Sfera
Passala a IZI, a Rkomi oppure a Tedua
Da Roma a Napoli, da Milano a Genova
Mando un bacio a mia madre Carmela
Cuoricini ai fratelli che stanno in galera
Mezza birra va a voi, la versiamo per terra
Non parlare se non sai un cazzo della faccenda
Questi mi vogliono dentro come Gucci o Mandela
Una collana gialla, sembra Lisa Simpson
Una faccia di Cristo, sembra Mel Gibson
Noi siamo o’ Track, tu Malammore
La nuova scissione, sai come finisce

[Strofa 2: Enzo Dong]
La mia vita tarantella tipo Tarantino
Tutte sere nere, io qua la sera rapino
Dimmi dove ognuno nasce giudicato
Dimmi dove, come, quando che poi ti rovino
Voglio vino Tavernello tipo rabbino
Saltate tra i palazzi con un rampino
Salutate i miei ragazzi con una biro
Sì caro, siamo i sicari sigari cubani fregati a Capodichino
Se, quale ferro? Se di ferro c’hai solo il disco di Tiziano Ferro
Fanculo alla tua cazzo di gang bang
Che dopo due Tennent's
M’arriva e mi ripete gang, gang, ga-ga-gang (ma c' vuò?)
Come la mettiamo, si vede
Che io lo faccio come si deve
Arrivo con la Polo Gang
E. Dong addio rapper
Rock'n'roll, Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Strofa 3: Tony Effe]
Non andrò mai in galera
Con la gang da quand'ero sperma
Passo giù a Secondigliano e torno gonfio in centro
Fumo così tanta erba che mi scambi per un negro
Lucciole sul collo, può vedermi anche un cieco
Quando passo c'è il sole, il mio pendente è una torcia
Come a Napoli nei boxer la pistola
La tua ragazza mi vuole al compleanno per torta
Mi vede entrare e dopo diventa tutta rossa
Facciamo soldi, morti, proprio come a Napoli
Fuori tutti quanti i ragazzi dalle carceri (liberi)

339,You're My World,"[Intro]
You were my Earth

[Verse 1]
And with a smile like an ocean wave
You catapult around the Sun
And meet me at the other side
To tell me that you found it fun
Swimmin' in the UV rays
You shouted like the sound of thunder
Boomin' through my stupid shades
You shook all of the ground undone
I slipped into your beauty like a mudslide
And on my search, I found nothing but upsides
Your arms extend like branches
Whenever we touch I feel the bark begin to
Soften up at all my sappy punchlines
Maybe that's the reason

[Chorus]
You're my earth
You're the planet
You're the grass
The wind and tides
And now that you're gone
I feel so out of place
And now that you're gone
I'm just driftin' through space
And now that you're gone
I feel so out of place
And now that you're gone
I'm just driftin' through space

[Verse 2]
And when we split up like Pangea
I was hopin' that we could reform
A landbridge between our separate pieces of the Earth
Before our disconnect began to breed a species
That would hurt much more
Than carnivores, herbivores, recklessness or urban swarm
Maybe I could wash up on a certain shore
Smilin' past a long night of drinkin'
And the lights above the island
Watching lightnin' flash every time
You open up your eyelids
Gentle smirks exploding like a fire in the sky
Until you scared away the forest creatures
Sleepin' in the trees
They began to huddle next to me
Weepin' in the leaves
See I watched you change the temperature
Increasin' the degrees
Until the warmth was just enough
To let them nestle into peace
I never thought there'd be
A problem that we couldn't solve
When you control the weather's climate
And the sea levels and all
But I suppose that when an earthquake
Splits the crust above the faults
I shouldn't act as if the damage
Wouldn't break up those involved

[Chorus]
You were my earth
You were the planet
You were the grass
The wind and tides
And now that you're gone
I feel so out of place
And now that you're gone
I'm just driftin' through space
And now that you're gone
I feel so out of place
And now that you're gone

341,I Believe,"[ELDER PRICE]
Ever since I was a child, I tried to be the best...
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed...
So what happened?

It was supposed to be all so exciting, to be teaching of Christ 'cross the sea
But I allowed my faith to be shaken – oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed to help the needy, to do the things I never dared
This was the time for me to step up, so then why was I so scared?

A warlord who shoots people in the face – what's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier and always has my back
Now I must be completely devout; I can't have even one shred of doubt!

I believe that the Lord God created the universe
I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins
And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America
I am a Mormon!
And a Mormon just believes

You cannot just believe part-way, you have to believe in it all
My problem was doubting the Lord's will, instead of standing tall
I can't allow myself to have any doubt, it's time to set my worries free
Time to show the world what Elder Price is about, and share the power inside of me!

I believe that God has a plan for all of us
I believe that plan involves me getting my own planet
And I believe that the current President of the Church, Thomas Monson, speaks directly to God
I am a Mormon!
And, dang it, a Mormon just believes! (A Mormon just believes!)

I know that I must go and do the things my God commands (Things my God commands!)
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith, he will always answer you
Just believe in him and have no fear

[UGANDAN SOLDIER]
(General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!)

[ELDER PRICE]
I believe that Satan has a hold of you
I believe that the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people! (Black people!)
You can be a Mormon!
A Mormon who just believes...

[GENERAL BUTT-FUCKING NAKED]
(The fuck is this?)

[ELDER PRICE]
And now I can feel the excitement: this is the moment I was born to do
And I feel so incredible to be sharing my faith with you
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith, if you ask God himself, you'll know
But you must ask him without any doubt, and let your spirit grow! (Let your spirit grow!)

I believe that God lives on a planet called Kolob!
I believe that Jesus has his own planet as well
And I believe that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri


If you believe, the Lord will reveal it
And you'll know it's all true – you'll just feel it
You'll be a Mormon!
And, by gosh, a Mormon just believes
(A Mormon just believes)

(Just believe, a Mormon just believes)
Oh, I believe! (Just believe, a Mormon just...)

347,You're My Remedy,"Don't give me no headache powders
They don't do no good for me
There is nothing I can take
When my head starts to ache
Cause you're my remedy

Oh baby, you're my remedy
Oh how you soothe me
You can call my name
And soothe all my pain
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy

When things look dark and dreary
And I'm as blue as I can be
The only thing to cheer me
Is to have you near me
Cause you're my remedy

Oh baby, you're my remedy
Oh how you soothe me
When the going gets tough
And I've stood enough
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy

Don't call a doctor
A nurse is worse
Cause a pill won't heal my pain
When I'm feeling blue
You know what to do
To make me feel alright again

Sometimes I get to trembling and shaking
Like a leaf shaking on a tree
It's just as I suspect
I'll be a nervous wreck
But you're my remedy

Oh baby, you're my remedy
Oh, how you soothe me
I need you around
To calm me down
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy

You're my remedy
You're my remedy
You're my remedy
All I really need

You're my remedy
Oh how you soothe me
You can call my name
And soothe all my pain
Oh pretty baby
You're my remedy

You're my remedy
When the going gets tough
And I've stood enough

348,Sailor Boy,"As lover, I'm shit. She's always known it
She craves confusion, I aid her delusion
The sailor boy, her sailor boy

A junkie's eyes, handsome and thin
Ropes blows and whips, oh I bound her within
Oh - oh

It's funny, it's funny, it's funny I say
How insecurity works out this way
The bigger my sins, more she wants me
The bigger my lies, more she gives to me

I choose when I hurt her, I choose when she smiles
There's annihilation here, the love I defile
I lose my need for her, lose my feelings
Lose myself in this puddle of drugs

In our ship, she patches the holes
I hit her when she needs me to, she keeps control
Thought I was on top, but I see I'm below
Thought I was captain, she stows me in hold
Now I cannot get this collar off of my neck
Now I cannot abandon this wreck",Black Tape for a Blue Girl,1964,"[81, 83, 90]",3

Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?

With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things

364,One Piece Topless Bathing Suit,"I was sitting on the beach
Just picking up some sun
When my buddy ran up to me
He said you won't believe what's going on
But it's something that you've gotta see

You know that bathing suit
That they're talking about on the tv and radio
Well granny's wearing one by the hot dog stand
And she's putting on quite a show

Yeah, in her one piece topless bathing suit
In Boston she'd be banned
In her one piece topless bathing suit
She's the coolest girl in the sand

So I got up to take a look at her
And I finally made it through the crowd
Where some of the guys were clapping their hands
And some of them were laughing out loud
But there she was like my buddy did say
For everyone to see
That little old lady about 94 doing the watusi
Yeah, ooooh... ha ha ha

One piece topless bathing suit
In Boston she'd be banned
In her one piece topless bathing suit
She's the coolest girl in the sand
Yeah... go granny go

One piece topless bathing suit
And she's only 94 years old
One piece topless bathing suit
And she's only 94 years old

If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intension of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me

[Intro]
Old school flow
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
They used to say
They used to say

[Hook]
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
This rap shit (is not for real)
This rap shit (is not for real)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
This rap shit (is not for real)
This rap shit (is not for real)

[Verse 1]
Yeah I remember it so clearly
Rappin’ to my pop about the cars and the clothes
Shrimp and the lobster that I heard about
Like word of mouth
The UGK tape and Scarface will turn ya out
I was like 13 thirsting for a good beat
Scoping for a studio talkin’ bout I spit heat
Like Ball & G, on that pimp type shit
Three 6 had me crunk on that late night tip

[Hook]
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
This rap shit (is not for real)
This rap shit (is not for real)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
This rap shit (is not for real)
This rap shit (is not for real)

[Verse 2]
I played ball for a minute, did I mention wasn’t in it
Writing rhymes on my glove so I will never forget em
Had to quit it, didn’t feel it back in high school
Rather write poems, known for flowing, thats what I do
Couldn’t be little Zac forever, peace to my big brother
Follow ya dreams baby, thats word to my grandmother
When I hear the streets tappin’, my beats kickin’ my flow
I overhear the same shit they always say before (he’s dreaming)

[Hook]

This rap shit (is not for real)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
This rap shit (is not for real)
This rap shit (is not for real)

[Verse 3]
I told them call me KRIT, they told me change my name
Don’t be alarmed if you don’t make it, thats just part of the game
Besides I ain't rapping about dope nor did I sell it
I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling
A&R’s searching for a hit, I just need a meal
Couldn’t afford to pay the rent, but passed up on the deal
Cause, it wasn’t right sometimes you gotta wade the storm
In a class of my own, but I was scared to raise my arm
Like, this my dream, this my life, I sacrificed it all
Except my soul in the firm belief there is a God
Watching out, when all the others used to doubt
Felt my pain and pointed down and said “Son, your time is now”
I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low
Thats between her and the lord I’ll never know
For those that caught me in the Spin, in Complex magazine, XXL, the Vibe and whatever inbetween
It’s safe to say that dreams come true I guess
Don’t let nobody tell ya, try for yourself
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer
But I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers
They used to say
They used to say
They used to say
They used to say

[Hook]
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
They used to say (He’s dreamin)
This rap shit (is not for real)
This rap shit (is not for real)

They used to say (He’s dreamin)

This rap shit (is not for real)

[Verse 3]
No particular place to go
So we parked way out on the kokomo
The night was young and the moon was bold
So we both decided to take a stroll
Can you imagine the way I felt?
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt

[Verse 4]
Ridin' along in my calaboose
Still tryin' to get her belt aloose

I be bangin' all on that beat
808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see
A-A-All that ass, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, this liquor, 'bout to penetrate
While I'm pushin' Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-dick her, I'ma go for hours
You minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as fuck in these Margielas
I skate past, a nigga better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine
My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, bitch nervous
Better ride this wave, bitch, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
Only thing you close is these curtains
And she only got time for a nigga if I take her out to eat
A nigga really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the pussy
I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate
Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe

Come through, fuck you all night

On a couch, hit it from behind
Hit you with that large stroke

Blowin' up the line on my cellular
She wanna lock a nigga down on the regular
Talkin' crazy to me like she own the dick
But I don't trust her as far as I can throw the bitch, ha
Momma told me to find a keeper
But I switch like designer sneakers
A girl with the finest features
Every nigga wanna talk to her but I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back is my theme music
Her ass on my mind, I dream booty
Any nigga tryna fuck my bitch
Then it's off with his head, how kings do it
My rings ruby
Red bandana, I stay woopin'
Got too many cribs, I stay movin'
Three Lambos, I stay coupin'

Trouble now and troubled past
Times have changed, they rearrange

Swirling ball of anguished cries
Haunted, daunted, so unwanted
Feel its anger in me rise

Dream a dream then dash another
Life is there to interrupt
Someone out there call my mother
Look at me, mom, I'm all grown up

All those years she scrimped and saved
And now of course it comes to this
If only Ivy had behaved
Or learned to stop at just a kiss
It hits me paralyzing shudder
Face the music take a bow
Just another unwed mother
One more sad statistic now

Dream a dream then dash another
Life is there to interrupt
Someone out there call my mother
Look at me I'm all grown up
Look at me I'm all grown up

Little lies and big decisions
Who to tell and where to go
Follow someone else's vision
Or trust my own? 'Cause I don't know

Am I supposed to love this child?
Is it just that simple then?
Tell me how this change will happen
Tell me how and tell me when
Tell me how and tell me when

Dream a dream then dash another
Life is there to interrupt
Someone out there tell my mother
Look at me I'm all grown up

It's an unforgiving world

How can I?

""Son, I've got something to say.""
And what he told me I'll never forget until my dying day

He said, ""Son, you'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you'll be a bachelor boy until your dying day.""

When I was sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as can be
But I remembered just in time what my daddy said to me

He said, ""Son, you'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you'll be a bachelor boy until your dying day.""

As time goes by, I probably will meet a girl and fall in love
Then, I'll get married, have A-wife and A-child
And they'll be my turtle dove

But until then, I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay-yay-yay
Happy to be a bachelor boy until my dying day

386,The First Night Of The Full Moon,"On the first night
of the full moon,
the primeval sack of ocean
broke,
& I gave birth to you
little woman,
little carrot top,
little turned-up nose,
pushing you out of myself
as my mother
pushed
me out of herself,
as her mother did,
& her mother's mother before her,
all of us born
of woman.

I am the second daughter
of a second daughter
of a second daughter,
but you shall be the first.
You shall see the phrase
'second sex'
only in puzzlement,
wondering how anyone,
except a madman,
could call you 'second'
when you are so splendidly
first,
conferring even on your mother
firstness, vastness, fullness
as the moon at its fullest
lights up the sky.

Now the moon is full again
& you are four weeks old.
Little lion, lioness,
yowling for my breasts,
growling at the moon,
how I love your lustiness,
your red face demanding,
your hungry mouth howling,
your screams, your cries
which all spell life
in large letters
the color of blood.

You are born a woman
for the sheer glory of it,
little redhead, beautiful screamer.
You are no second sex,
but the first of the first;
& when the moon's phases
fill out the cycle
of your life,
you will crow
for the joy
of being a woman,
telling the pallid moon
to go drown herself
in the blue ocean,
& glorying, glorying, glorying
in the rosy wonder
of your sunshining wondrous

CB Man: Big boy, this is little boy. How’d things go down at the chicken coop?

CB Man: Roger that. Little girl will take point on your front door. See you at the drop station, Mack. I’m clear.

We see the view from one of the side mirrors to see a black SUV. We pan back a bit to see two black SUVs driving alongside the truck. He looks down at the woman driving the first SUV and gives her a nod, she gives him a wave with a few of her fingers. She quickly pulls in front of the truck while the second SUV stays behind.

Suddenly the front SUV is lifted from the ground, almost like there was an explosion under it. However, we see no fire or any other indication of what caused the SUV to go airborne. It flies quite a distance into the sky then lands in front of the truck on it’s roof. The truck quickly swerves to avoid the SUV.

Driver: Son of a bitch!

He ends up taking the truck into the median between the opposite lanes of traffic but then gets it back on the road. He picks up his CB.

Driver: You see that?

CB Man: Little girl is down. Escort 2 is down!

Driver: I know, Sherlock. What the hell hit us?

He reaches up to the ceiling and hits a button. Suddenly his windshield has become a sort of touch screen computer. He hits a few buttons still keeping the truck on the road. We see a bright red line appear on the window in front of him. He waves it away then clicks the button on the ceiling turning off the computer. He picks up his CB.

Driver: We need to go to alt two, alt two.

CB Man: Nothing over our shoulder.

The SUV that was in the back is now moving to go in front of the truck.

CB Man: Back door’s clear. Protect the cargo at all costs.

The driver starts talking but no longer into the CB, just into the cab in general.

Driver: S.H.I.E.L.D. region CT, this is Agent Mack. We are under attack from an unseen I-don’t-know-what.

He’s looking up and all around trying to find out what’s going on. As he does so the SUV that is now in the front goes airborne just as the first one did. Except this time it’s shoved off the road, it doesn’t land in front of him. He gets a female response to his earlier statement.

S.H.I.E.L.D. Voice: Agent Mack advise as to the nature of threat, over.

Mack: What in the Holy name of –

He is looking up in the sky but his words are cut off when the truck goes airborne as well. The truck goes into the air at a 90 degree angle from the ground.

Mack: S.H.I.E.L.D. Region CT…oh, hell, I can’t explain.

The truck is suddenly dropped, almost like it had been held up by a string that has now been cut. We can hear Mack yelling as it falls.

Mack: Oh, no!

Black Screen.

Next we see the truck on its side, flames in the engine area. We can hear the S.H.I.E.L.D. voice still over intercom.

S.H.I.E.L.D. Voice: Mack, come in! Are you there, Agent Mack?

We pan to the cab of the truck, Mack is either knocked out or dead. While the cab of the truck has landed on its side the bed of the truck remains upright. We pan around the truck to see a construction backhoe slowly making its way over to the truck. Men in camo run behind the backhoe. They use the arm of the backhoe to break apart the bed of the truck. The men in camo are there once opened and are throwing out the empty paper boxes that were obviously a cover for whatever is in there. Once a path is clear we can see a door with a keypad and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo. One of the men in camo takes a blowtorch to the door working. Once they have made an opening they kick away the metal. Inside the room is a man strapped into some sort of chair. He puts his glasses on as they open his room.

Room Man: Are we there yet?

Title Screen.

Next we see The Bus flying through the air, looking all spiffy and fixed. We cut inside the cargo hold. Ward is in there hitting a punching bag. He is about to punch it when he sees someone and halts his hit.

Ward: You know, you’re late.

The camera pans over to show Skye walking down the spiral staircase. She’s dressed in a tank top and has her hands taped like Ward’s.

Skye: I’m tired from the mornings workout. I thought I was joining S.H.I.E.L.D., not 24 hour fitness.

She steps up to the punch bag and Ward stands next to her.

Ward: It’s called relative strength training, starting with the basics.

He takes her hand and messes with the tape.

Ward: And next time you do 15 push-ups for every minute you’re late.

He drops that wrist and picks up the other one.

Skye: Fine, Mr. Fun Machine. Better than pull-ups. I don’t ever want to do another pull-up again.

Ward: You find yourself hanging off the edge of a building 20 stories up, you’re gonna want to do at least one.

He stops messing with her tape and takes a fighting position facing the bag.

Ward: Stand here.

He pulls his hands up high, near his face.

Ward: Jab, cross, like this.

He shows her how he wants her to hit then backs up.

Ward: 10 minutes.

Skye hits the bag, but with nowhere near the force Ward was using.

Ward: You know the hardest part about boxing?

Skye: Getting punched in the face?

Ward: Keeping your hands up.

He once again pulls both of his hand up by his face showing her, she drops her arms in frustration.

Skye: Why do I even have to do this? I’m sure Fitz-Simmons’ supervising officer didn’t make them do this muscle stuff.

She weakly hits the bag a few times while speaking, Ward just stares at her.

Ward: You said you wanted to be a field agent, like Coulson. Well, if you’d like to switch disciplines…

He looks over into the lab. Both Fitz and Simmons are wearing lab coats. Fitz has an aerosol can in his hands spraying it showing a laser line as Simmons looks at Ward.

Ward: What did your S.O. give you guys for morning drills?

Simmons gets excited.

Simmons: Oh, atomistic attribute drills.

While she continues to speak Ward nods his head and looks at Skye, she in response weakly hits the bag again.

Simmons: Yeah, we’d name the mechanical, chemical, thermal –

Fitz: Electrical properties of materials.

Skye: Okay, okay, they made your point.

She continues to hit the bag, Ward walks to stand on the opposite side of the bag and hold it.

Ward: There will come a moment when you have to commit to this or bail. Every field agent has a defining moment. Ask Coulson. When you have to make the hard call to either dedicate yourself to this or to curl up in a ball and run.

Skye stops hitting, if that’s what you call it, and looks at Ward.

Skye: How can you run if you’re curled up in a ball?

She starts hitting again.

Ward: It’s my job as your S.O.to make sure you don’t die before then.

While he talks he lifts her hands higher up by her face.

Ward: Come on.

She starts to hit the bag again. (And funnily, in the background, Fitz seems to be pointing the laser at Simmons, we can see it on her face and she’s holding up her hands trying to block it. )

Skye: So what’s yours, Agent Ward?

Ward: 10 minutes.

Skye: Your defining moment?

He stays silent so she stops hitting.

Skye: Come on, tell me. I want to know.

She starts to hit again.

Skye: I can get Coulson to give you some of that truth serum. You could spill your little heart out to me again.

She’s teasing, but he seems to be taking it all seriously.

Ward: You mean my level one overshare that miraculously got you to cooperate?

She looks away unsure then back to him.

Ward: I hate to tell you this, rookie, but we don’t have a truth serum.

Skye’s mouth drops open in shock.

Skye: Wha-

There is a ding overhead and May’s voice comes over the speakers.

May: Changing course, briefing in three.

The camera pans over to Fitz in the lab.

Fitz: Ah, looks like we’re on the move.

He takes off his lab coat as Simmons smiles and does the same. Ward goes up the stairs as Skye sulks.

May over Intercom: S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 with new orders.

Cut to May inside the cockpit.

May: Set for Colorado air field north.

Cut to the living room area of the plane. Fitz and Simmons are sitting on a couch as Ward and Skye enter. Coulson enters from the opposite side of the plane.

Coulson: A few minutes ago a S.H.I.E.L.D. transport was attacked while carrying a priority red protected asset off Route 76 near Sterling.

Fitz whistles.

Simmons: Priority red?

Coulson: The asset was Canadian physicist Dr. Franklin Hall.

He walked in carrying a table, he now turns it so all can see a picture of Dr. Hall.

Coulson: Known for his work –

We pan over to see Fitz and Simmons both stricken by this news. Fitz’ face shows shock while Simmons has both of her hands to her face worried.

Simmons: Oh, no. Not Frank.

Fitz: Dr. Hall? He was our chemical kinetics advisor our second year.

Simmons: Yeah, he’s so enthusiastic about science, we just adored him. We can rescue him, can’t we?

Coulson: He’s one of ours. We’re gonna try.

Ward: And the attackers?

Coulson: Invisible.

He walks off as Skye gives Ward a confused look.

Skye: Wait, invisible?

She laughs amused.

Skye: Cool.

She looks at Ward, he shares none of her humor or excitement, she drops the smile from her face.

Skye: But terrible.

Cut to the whole group, Skye, Ward, Coulson, May, Fitz and Simmons walking on a dark street. The runner at the bottom of the screen says: Sterling, Colorado.

Skye: Dr. Hall was an asset?

Coulson: One of a few select scientists S.H.I.E.L.D. has been protecting, people our enemies would love to get their hands on. We keep them hidden, keep them on the move.

Simmons: Which is why Fitz and I were so lucky to have him.

Coulson: We don’t have him anymore.

Skye: And, what does priority red mean?

Coulson: It means security should have been…

His words trail off when they hear the groaning of metal. They look up and see one of the SUVS inside a tree.

Coulson: Heavy.

Cut to Mack. He is still alive but got banged up in the crash, there’s a large bandage on the side of his head.

Mack: It was pretty damn scary, and I don’t spook easily, boss.

We pan out to see he is sitting in the back of a van speaking with Coulson and May. Fitz is in the background on his tablet.

May: Nothing in the air from above?

Mack nods.

Mack: Nothing over our shoulder, but what’s scary is they knew our route.

We pan over to see that Fitz is shining some sort of grid like laser line onto the road. With this panned back view we can see that they are all next to the tractor trailer.

Mack: They were waiting for us.

Coulson: Are you saying they were working with somebody inside S.H.I.E.L.D.?

He looks down and away for a moment, almost embarrassed then looks back at Coulson.

Mack: Sorry to say…it had to be.

The sound of Simmons calling out gets their attention.

Simmons: Fitz, what am I seeing here?

We pan over to see Simmons has on some sort of green goggles and is holding some sort of metal instrument in her hand. Fitz walks over to her.

Fitz: Well, I’m not wearing the full-spectrum goggles I designed, so – no clue.

Skye and Ward also walk behind Fitz over to where Simmons is. May leaves Coulson’s side and wonders over, after a moment Coulson does as well.

He laughs to Skye, she doesn’t laugh so his falters off. They reach Simmons.

Fitz: Let me have a look, come on.

He goes to reach out to her but she stops him.

Simmons: No, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, don’t move!

She looks down at his feet when he stops.

Simmons: Wait a second.

She picks some rocks off the road and throws them into the air, they gather together swirling all around each other like a tornado.

Skye: What in the hell?

Simmons: I think the electro-static field scanner activated some…thing.

She smiles. They all duck when the batch of rock and dirt go flying every which way, taking out one of the lights as it does so.

Coulson: Okay, can we deactivate it? Now?

Simmons hits a few keys, it becomes more aggressive.

Fitz: Have to increase the density.

Simmons: I tried, Fitz, but –

Pieces of rock are hitting metal all around causing panging sounds as the others randomly duck.

May: Fitz!

He’s clicking away on something that looks like a mix between a cell phone and a walkie-talkie. One of the rocks hits it doing damage.

Fitz: Whoa.

Suddenly it all dies out. Simmons bends down to the ground and picks some sort of small sphere up off the ground using tweezers. She holds it out for Coulson to see.

Simmons: That did all this.

Coulson plucks the sphere off the tweezers and into his fingers.

Everyone is staring at the sphere Coulson has.

Skye: What is that?

We get a close up look at it, it almost looks like two rings that form a sphere, inside those rings, at the center is some sort of gray material that is constantly moving.

Coulson: Something big.

Commercial Break.

Open on Fitz inside the lab on The Bus. He has the device found on the road in some sort of machine, he’s looking at it with glasses that are lit on either side. The machine holding it is some sort of mechanized gripper. He lowers the device down as Coulson and May watch.

Coulson: Either someone cracked our comm system or Dr. Hall’s movements leaked from inside S.H.I.E.L.D.

We pan back further to see Simmons standing next to Fitz looking at the device and Skye standing next to her looking nervous.

May: You really think we have a mole?

Skye’s ears seem to perk up to this, she turns her head to listen but doesn’t look at them.

Coulson: I think you should go through the communication logs, rule it out. We’ll work the tractor tread that we found on the scene.

Skye leans back from the table.

Skye: I can do that, instead of pull-ups. I can upload an image of the tread pattern and check to see if there’s any sort of –

Her words are cut off by Ward.

Ward: Already done. Matched it to a 2010 model. Found a list of purchasers within a 500 mile radius. Narrowed down to those with priors, financial troubles or propensity for risk-taking.

Ward has pulled what he found on a screen in the lab. He hits a button on his tablet and points.

Ward: Three suspects.

We see three different mug shot looking pictures up on the screen now.

Coulson: Who may have sold their construction equipment to the kidnappers. We’ll ask.

Ward exits the room and Skye turns to Coulson.

Skye: Hey, so, Ward said a funny thing. He said that you guys don’t have a truth serum.

Coulson smiles.

Coulson: Did he? Ward said that?

Skye: Yeah.

Coulson: Interesting.

Skye: Yeah.

Coulson says nothing else and walks away.

Skye: Hey, wait –

May: Hey.

She turns her attention to May. May drops a giant binder into Skye’s waiting arms.

Skye: Do you want me to bench press this?

May: Read it. Every communication out of HQ since they decided to transfer Dr. Hall.

May walks away leaving a shocked looking Skye.

Skye: Hang in there, doc. It’s gonna be awhile.

Cut to outside, the runner on the bottom of the screen says: Barnroof Point, Colorado. We see a man riding a horse down a trail. When he gets to the bottom of the small hill he crested Coulson is waiting there.

Coulson: Excuse me.

The man stops his horse.

Man: Who the hell are you?

We can see Coulson has brought Lola out of the cargo hold. We can also see that the man has a shotgun holster on his saddle.

Coulson: A concerned citizen, who happens to be a member of a giant bureaucratic organization that’s tracking your every move.

Man: I haven’t done anything wrong.

Coulson: Of course not, but you sold your excavator to some people who did.

Coulson takes off his glasses.

Coulson: And you’re hiding out here until things cool down because you know it.

The man seems to go on guard.

Coulson: I just want to know who paid you.

He takes out the shotgun and points it at Coulson.

Man: Paid me enough not to answer any questions like that.

Suddenly an arm comes into frame gripping his shotgun, the arms give the gun a mighty pull causing the man to fall off his horse. We see those arms belonged to Ward and the man lands on his back holding up his hands in surrender as Ward points the shotgun at him.

Ward: Feels like the Old West.

Man: They gave me money for my equipment, that’s all. I never saw a face. I never heard a name.

Coulson: And how did you receive this money? They write you a check?

The man points at his saddlebag. Ward lowers the gun, just a bit, and reaches over to the saddlebag. He sakes the bag and thin bars of gold fall out. Coulson bends down and picks one up.

Coulson: Paid you in gold?

Ward: Now it really feels like the Old West.

Cut to inside the lab. The gold bars are sitting on a table as Simmons runs some sort of lit wand over them scanning them.

Simmons: It looks like this because it’s a Dore Bar. It means it was made at the mine rather than in a refinery. It’s only about 92% pure. The cowboy got cheated a bit.

Coulson: Can you determine the mine based on the impurities?

Fitz: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

He walks away from the bars of gold to a computer.

Fitz: We’ve done that already.

He clicks on the computer keys.

Fitz: It’s from the Dacey Mine in Tanzania, which is owned by –

Coulson: Quinn Worldwide. I’m sure you studied the CEO in your chemical engineering classes, or saw him on the cover of Forbes – Ian Quinn.

Coulson walks out of the lab.

Cut to nighttime over some city. The runner on the bottom says: Republic of Malta. We cut to a fancy house. A man and woman, both in white, are walking along the pathway. He’s speaking on his cell phone.

Fancy Man: We can’t just pluck it from the ground like a potato. It needs to be extracted from the ore and enriched. I know. You know, tell him this investment paid for that ridiculous yacht of his and that he’ll thank me at the shareholders meeting.

He takes the phone away from his ear and hands it to the woman.

Cut to inside a room, we see Dr. Hall sitting there. He perks up when he hears the door open and the Fancy Man walks up to him.

Fancy Man: Why is he tied up?

Hall: Quinn.

Quinn: Does he look like a threat?

A man walks over to Hall and uses a knife to cut his bonds.

Quinn: I’m sorry about these guys.

Quinn grabs a stool and sits down. He gives Hall a big smile then laughs. He reaches forward and claps Hall on his legs.

Quinn: Welcome to Malta, Frank.

Quinn laughs again, Hall doesn’t seem amused.

Hall: You know, it’s one thing to steal my ideas, Ian, but stealing me?

Quinn: First of all, I never stole our ideas. We always agreed information should be free.

Hall: It’s amazing how much money you’ve made off free information.

Quinn: And secondly, think of this as a rescue mission, Frank. In fact, in a moment, I think you’ll be thanking me. My staff intercepted a communication about the movement of a certain asset, and when I deduced that asset was you, I couldn’t pass up on the opportunity. It’s a little out of my comfort zone, sure.

He holds up a finger to Hall and stands, Hall following suit.

Hall: Malta You’re not stupid.

Quinn has walked over to some cabinets and opens them, pulling out a bottle of liquor.

Hall: S.H.I.E.L.D. can’t come after you here.

Quinn: Not just S.H.I.E.L.D. I am now a naturalized citizen of this fair country. Stunning beaches, beautiful tax laws and a deep seeded hatred of outside forces telling them what to do.

Hall: Sounds like your dating profile.

He smiles at Quinn who laughs.

Quinn: Right. I moved my entire operation down here. Bought the old Prime Minister’s estate. It’s not really my style, but they had this huge underground facility, so I figured, hey.

He walks around the table back to Hall with the drinks.

Hall: Always been a stubborn bastard. Now you’ve finally found a place where the watchdogs can’t touch you.

He takes the glass from Quinn holding it up, Quinn brings his glass up as well chinking them together.

Quinn: Not without breaking international law.

They both take a drink

Quinn: But, more importantly, old friend, they can’t touch you.

Quinn pulls something out of his pocket and shows it to Hall, it looks like the same type of device that was found on the road by Simmons. He sets it on a table above a monitor and looks at Hall.

Quinn: Recognize the design?

Hall picks it up and looks at it.

Quinn: We were barely old enough to drink when you sketched the blueprint. That’s just a miniature prototype. A theoretical machine powered by a theoretical substance.

Hall looks up at him with surprise.

Quinn: Frank, you were right.

He nearly smiles.

Hall: You found it?

Cut to Fitz standing in front of a monitor which shows some sort of atom behind him.

Fitz: Gravitonium. It’s an extremely rare high-atomic numbered element.

Simmons speaks from off screen.

Simmons: It powers the device.

We pull the camera out and see that they are speaking to Skye in their lab.

Simmons: It’s so extremely rare that most people didn’t believe it existed , much less the theory that an isolated positive charge –

Fitz: Would turn the flow from isotropic –

Skye stops them.

Skye: Guys, High School drop out here. How does the device work again?

Fitz looks over to Simmons for help, she complies. She gets out of her seat and walks to the picture of the atom on the monitor. She seems to go into school teacher mode, speaking slower and pointing at the atom like a spokesmodel would.

Simmons: Well, gravitonium distorts gravity fields within itself, causing an undulating amorphous shape.

Fitz decides to give it a try too.

Fitz: Yeah, which causes these, um, wiggly bits here, but when an electric current is applied the gravitonium solidifies.

He too is using basic hand gestures and speaking slowly. When he says “solidifies” he brings his hands together like a ball.

Fitz: And those gravity fields erupt…

He begins shaking his hands showing the movement of the atom then blows them apart. We see Skye’s face, not sure she’s getting this simpler version, she still looks confused.

Fitz: Randomly changing the rules of gravity around it.

Fitz moves to another part of the room seeming to get animated.

Fitz: Well, so, now you can imagine what would happen to a big rig at 100 kilometers per hour.

Fitz has walks over to what I believe to be his work station, it seems to be the place the goes to most when in the lab.

Fitz: Or, uh, well, you could just remember, cause we saw it already. Didn’t we?

Simmons: Yeah, and guess which genius published every theory about gravitonium and possible applications, years ago.

Skye: Dr. Franklin Hall.

Simmons smiles.

Simmons: Yes.

Fitz: Correct. And Dr. Hall attended the University of Cambridge at the same time as Ian Quinn.

Skye starts shaking her head.

Skye: Coulson may be off on this. Quinn is a notoriously good guy. His charity endowment’s something like $8 billion.

Simmons: Yes, with money made from leeching the Earth of its resources. Looks like he’s dug up another.

Cut back to Quinn and Hall in the same room, Hall still holds the device.

Quinn: 20 years, 12 mines, 6 continents, but yes, I finally found it. And now?

He laughs.

Quinn: We get to play with it.

He continues laughing as Hall scoffs just a bit.

Hall: Do you remember in all our talks on Orchard Street, the part where it’s very, very dangerous?

Quinn: Everything powerful is dangerous. But, I’m not going to convince you with more talk, talk of 50% shares, talk of Nobel Prizes. No, not you. You…

He reaches over to the monitor and slides his finger up pulling something up on the screen.

Quinn: Will just have to see it.

We hear a noise off screen, it sounds like a door opening. Hall looks over as the doors are opened. The camera pans and we see a bigger version of the device in his hand, a much bigger version.

Quinn: I built a full sized generator, but I need you to tell me how to control the gravity fields.

He looks from the big version down to the small version in his hand.

Quinn: You can complete your life’s work. I plan to do this, with or without you, but I know you. I know you’d want it done right.

Hall gives a tiny nod of his head and looks back at the big version as Quinn nods behind him and claps him on the shoulder.

Quinn: Now is the moment when you thank me.

Cut to inside the plane, see Skye walking toward where we hear Coulson and Ward talking.

Coulson: The man’s a prisoner, and it’s up to us to get him out.

Ward: We’ve checked the specs. There’s no way into Quinn’s compound without a large S.H.I.E.L.D. strike force or a man inside.

We now see that Coulson and Ward are discussing things in the Planning Room. As Skye enters the room we see that May, Fitz and Simmons are also in there.

Ward: He’s got Neodymium laser fencing surrounding the property.

Coulson: They’ll never allow a strike force into Malta. Plus, this weekend, Quinn Worldwide’s got its annual shareholders gathering. We’d risk global outrage, but –

May: If we go in alone –

Coulson: S.H.I.E.L.D. can disavow us, claim ignorance.

May: Without a man inside it’s impossible, unless you’re immune to Neodymium laser emissions.

Fitz stands up seeming to have gotten an idea.

Fitz: If we had a monkey, we could get in.

Simmons squeezes her eyes shut in frustration.

Simmons: Ugh, Fitz!

Fitz: If we had a small monkey he could slip through the sensors and disable the fence’s power source with his adorable little hands.

For his part Coulson seems to be actually listening, Skye not so much. She has her cellphone up and is messing with it.

Skye: I could go in.

No one seems to hear her.

Ward: Drop me in the hills outside of Valletta. I’ll spend a few weeks establishing a cover, gathering intel –

Coulson: Hall doesn’t have a few weeks.

Coulson walks away from the table frustrated.

Simmons: And to restate, any agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. caught on Maltese soil can be shot to death with bullets –

Fitz: Yeah.

Simmons: Legally.

Skye was leaning against the wall but now stands up straighter.

Skye: Not me. I could go in.

They all are finally looking at her.

Ward: Skye, this is serious.

Coulson: Wait.

He walks closer to her.

Coulson: What are you saying?

Skye: Well, I’m not an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., so I could go in without breaking all these stupid rules.

She pulls her phone back up and starts typing.

Simmons: International laws.

Ward: This isn’t something the Rising Tide can hack, Skye.

Fitz: Did you hear the deadly lasers part? Without a brave monkey –

Skye: You said you could go in with a man inside.

May: And you want to be that man?

Skye: Fitz-Simmons loved the guy, and he needs help. They could be torturing him, or worse, making him do strength-training.

She shoots Ward a look at this then goes back to typing on her phone.

Ward: But you don’t have the background or clearance or experience with any of this.

Ward has walked away from the table to stand closer to Skye, right next to Coulson.

Skye: I know.

She holds up her phone and shows them all the screen.

Skye: But I’ve got an invitation.

They all stare at her while the music builds, she looks at her phone then adds:

Skye: Well, technically it’s an e-vite.

Commercial Break.

Open on The Bus flying through the night sky. We cut inside The Bus and see Coulson staring at a large rack of suits.

Coulson: I understand your concern, but we don’t have a lot of options.

He pulls one suit out as the camera pans back to see Ward standing next to Coulson’s closet.

Ward: Hey, I’m impressed. She just wrangled an invitation on her phone using insider back-channel voodoo in minutes. But sending her in with no training, you’re taking a huge risk.

While Ward is speak Coulson is examining his suit choice. FYI, it looks exactly like the one he’s wearing. He takes it deeper in the room leaving Ward by the closet, Ward follows after.

Ward: I know Director Fury felt he owed you after you sacrificed yourself.

Coulson: And my card collection.

Ward: He gave you some autonomy, but Skye on a covert op?

Coulson: Are you worried about her safety or her loyalty?

Ward: Both. The Rising Tide is the reason she got an invite. Who knows how many protocols she violated.

Now while they’ve been talking Coulson has set down his suit inside his office. He goes behind his desk and opens a binder reading something there.

Coulson: That’s her job. Ignore protocol, find connections and back doors that nobody else can see. Something else is bother you.

Ward sighs and walks a few paces away.

Ward: She’s holding back, sir. She says she wants to be an agent, but she won’t commit. She doesn’t listen, makes jokes.

Coulson: Were you hard on her?

Ward: Sure. I tried playing nice, too. I need a new strategy.

Coulson finishes what he was doing at his desk and looks at Ward. As he talks he walks around his desk to sit on the front of it and address Ward.

Coulson: Try no strategy. Stop thinking like an operative, start thinking like a person. Maybe Skye will let that person help her.

Ward: Help her what?

Coulson: Help her think like an operative.

He gives him a tiny smile and stands up.

Cut to Ward and Skye in the cargo hold. Ward has a gun pointed at Skye’s chest.

Ward: Now, again, slowly, what’s first?

Skye looks at his wrist then takes a hold of it, she then spins herself so that Ward’s gun arm is over her shoulder and her back is to his chest.

Ward: And then?

Skye: Then? Things are moving too quickly. I’m a proper southern girl.

Ward drops his head in disappointment at her joking again as she takes on a southern accent.

Skye: You’ll make me untidy.

Ward lets out a sigh and takes her other hand placing it on top of his holding the gun.

Ward: Twist the thumb, palm the barrel.

He pulls the gun out of her grip and walks away.

Skye: Ow.

Ward: You’re gonna die and leave us hanging out to dry, you know that? You’re going in with no self-defense skills –

Skye: I have a few tricks up my sleeve.

Ward: You need muscle memory, fundamentals, the tools to turn yourself –

Skye: Into a whole bag of tools?

Ward: How did you learn computer science without committing yourself to it?

Skye: C.S. comes naturally to me. I’m sorry I’m not a naturally whatever you are.

This seems to upset Ward, he walks closer to Skye.

Ward: You think this came naturally? I had a brother who beat the crap out of me, me and my little brother, for nothing. For eating a piece of his birthday cake. I had to learn to protect us, the way I am trying to protect you.

Skye for once doesn’t have anything flippant to say.

Ward: That was my moment. You asked.

Skye: Sorry. I didn’t mean to push.

There is a moment where they just stare at each other. However, Skye breaks the tension by holding up Ward’s gun.

Skye: But I did manage to take this.

Ward is not impressed, he takes the gun from her.

Ward: Getting the gun is one thing. Pulling the trigger, that is another.

He once again points the gun a Skye’s chest.

Ward: Now, again, slowly, what’s first?

Cut to inside the Planning Room, they are using it for just that. Coulson is talking about the mission plan with everyone there.

Coulson: Skye will walk in the front door. The only external access point to Quinn’s underground facility is from a beach cove.

He has walked over to the large screen. We see blueprints of Quinn’s compound up on the screen and he points things out.

Coulson: A two man extraction team could slip in there, but it’s not easy. Fitz-Simmons.

Fitz walks closer to the screen.

Fitz: The perimeter is surrounded by a 20 foot high neodymium laser grid. Touch it and you’re toast.

Coulson: Dead toast. The only way to disable the grid is to crack the system and trigger a reboot. This would give the team three seconds to cross. Of course Quinn’s too smart to allow any wireless access on his property.

Skye: That’s where I come in.

Simmons opens a case that was sitting on the table.

Simmons: Yes, working compact – holds up under x-ray.

Fitz gets it out as Ward and Coulson move closer for a look. Fitz opens the compact and shows the inside to Skye.

Fitz: Desert Rose, to match your complexion.

Skye smiles at this.

Fitz: But, oh, what’s this?

We see the mirror of the compact, it now has five red dots on it.

Fitz: A read out, okay?

The lights switch from five red on the left side to five green on the right side.

Fitz: Turns green if you’re in close enough proximity to a computer to gain wireless access.

Simmons: When it does you just drop this nearby and walk out. We’ll do the rest. Easy as pie.

Ward: Or it will be, if you stick to the plan.

Ward racks his gun causing the distinct click.

Skye: Got it. Plan, green, drop, walk…pie.

As Fitz hands her the compact Coulson walks over to May.

May: I don’t want to question your orders, sir.

Coulson: Good.

He steps around her to start out of the room, she sighs and speaks anyway. Coulson stops walking and May turns toward him.

May: But, I’ve already seen far more combat than I bargained for. This two man extraction team? It’s exactly the kind of action I was hoping to avoid.

Coulson turns to face her.

Coulson: That’s why you’re not on it.

May gives him a disbelieving look.

May: Specialist work is different from field work, believe me. When was the last time you –

Coulson: Hall’s one of ours and he’s in trouble. I need two men to get him out. Ward makes one.

He stares at her a long moment, she is the first to shift her eyes away.

Coulson: So that’s why I’m going in. You forget, I saw plenty of action with The Avengers.

He walks away but May says something under her breath.

May: And you died.

Coulson: All right team, suit up.

We cut to a coastal city in daytime. The runner on the bottom of the screen says: Republic of Malta.

We cut to the front of Quinn’s estate. People are entering when a taxi pulls up. Skye, looking fancy in a pink dress with her hair curled, gets out of the taxi. She takes a deep breath then walks forward to the front door.

Cut to inside the party, people are milling about, drinking and talking in low tones. A waitress stops by Skye with a tray of Champaign, she takes one.

Skye: Thank you.

The waitress walks away and Skye walks deeper into the party, sipping on her Champaign and taking it all in. Now a waiter walks up to Skye.

Waiter: Hors D’oeuvre, Madame?

She takes some sort of skewer off the tray and continues walking, but a man’s voice stops her.

Man: Who are you?

She quickly turns around to face the man. He is an older gentleman, a younger one walks over when he speaks to Skye.

Young Man: Oh, apologizes for his manners. He knows very little English.

Skye: Oh, that, uh, that’s – what, whatever.

She waves away the worry then extends her hand to the older man for a handshake.

Skye: Skye.

He slowly reaches out and shakes her hand.

Older Man: Qasim Zaghlul.

Skye: Big fan. You built half of Dubai, including the Arabian Blade.

He gives just the tiniest smirk.

Skye: I love that building, it’s super sci-fi. Where’s your wife…

We cut to inside The Bus. May and Simmons are standing at the Planning Table. May is feeding information to Skye as needed.

May: Wife’s name is Nadrah.

Cut back to Skye.

Skye: …Nadrah?

We hear May over Skye’s earpiece.

May: Twin sons.

Skye: Is she staying at home with the boys?

Cut back to inside The Bus. It looks like Fitz has just arrived, with a large bowl of popcorn. He whispers to the others.

Fitz: How’s she doing?

May and Simmons answer at the same time.

Both: She’s good.

Cut back to Skye, she reaches out and touches Qasim on the arm.

Skye: The pleasure is mine.

She gives them a small laugh then turns away. She almost immediately puts her hand to her ear after walking away from the men to talk to them on The Bus. (Something that would seem super obvious to me, but whatever.)

Skye: I could get used to this, people. It’s like Siri if it worked.

Skye looks at a group of people off to her right.

Skye: Sipper to Bravo, I got eyes on top dog. The eagle is landing on it.

Cut back to The Bus, May and Simmons look confused.

Simmons: What are you doing?

Cut back to Skye.

Skye: Uh, sorry, I – I don’t know. I see Quinn, I’m gonna go talk to him.

She starts off toward him.

Cut to The Bus, the three of them give each other worried looks.

Cut back to Skye. Quinn is walking toward her so she positions herself in his path.

Quinn: I mean, that and it’s effective on the industrial average.

She joins the group, when the others laugh so does she.

Man: That was good.

Skye: Yeah, right? Ian Quinn. I’m your last minute party crasher. Skye.

She extends her hand and he takes it giving it a shake.

Quinn: Oh.

He chuckles.

Quinn: Wow.

She chuckles as well.

Quinn: Great to meet you.

He address the others in the group around him.

Quinn: This is Skye, a member of The Rising Tide.

They all look at her, she gives a little wave.

Quinn: They’re a group of hackers. They’ve gotten some pretty big secrets out to the public.

Skye looks at the others.

Skye: I prefer “Hacktivist”. I’m glad you’ve heard of our site.

Quinn: I read it. We think very much alike, more freedom of information, less government infringing on everyone’s rights, I’m a fan.

Skye: That explains the invite. This is a tough party to get into.

Quinn: Not as hard to get into as the encrypted back channel you contact us through to request the invite.

She laughs.

Skye: That’s sort of where I live.

Quinn: You got to show me how you did that, I mean, if you sign on.

She looks to the others then back to him. This totally throws her off.

Skye: Sign what, now?

Quinn: I’ve been known to turn a few black hats into white hats. Not just for vulnerability analysis, but for very creative thinking.

Skye: A-Are you offering me a job?

Quinn: Well I didn’t invite you here for your pretty face. I didn’t know you had a pretty face. Yes, I want to hire you before someone else snatches you up.

He walks away from the group leaving Skye looking shocked. We hear May over her earpiece.

May: That seemed to go well.

Skye: Yeah, it did.

(Once again all she does is turn her back to the other people standing there, putting no distance between them. Probably won’t amount to much, but she’s bad at the stealth part of undercover.)

She takes a drink as the people at the party start to clap, Quinn has gotten in front of them to address them all. He is under a tent standing at a podium talking.

Quinn: Many of you shareholders have been with us for years, and I see a few new names here, but I want to thank you all for traveling so far to this beautiful country. And, well, for slumming it at Shaba Tal-Banar.

The crown laughs at his joke as he takes a drink.

Quinn: This country where we are allowed to pursue progress and profit without the stranglehold of regulations that are now choking our world. The United States government, the E.U., the DRTC, S.H.I.E.L.D., these are just a few of the institutions that are guilty of halting the development of new technology for anyone, except themselves.

Cut to the beach, we see Coulson and Ward coming ashore dragging an inflatable raft. While they do this we still hear Quinn’s voice.

Quinn: We dare defy them with a new idea.

We zoom closer to Coulson and Ward, Ward is in black pants with a black T-shirt, Coulson is – as usual – in a suit and tie.

Quinn: The steal in and sweep it out from under us.

Cut back to Quinn.

Quinn: But not today. You’re all aware of what Quinn Worldwide has been able to do with basic minerals, let alone Uranium or Plutonium, despite these unjust restrictions that weigh the scales in the other guy’s favor.

We pan over to Skye, she looks around seeing everyone is watching Quinn and begins to move away. We then pan back to Quinn.

Quinn: Well, today, I’m announcing something new, an element that could balance those scales.

The camera pans over from Quinn to the TV screen next to him showing the atom of gravitonium.

Quinn: And I mean that quite literally.

Cut to inside the room where we saw the full sized version of the device Quinn gave to Hall. Now there is a black undulating mass being lowered so it is parallel with the center of the device. We still hear Quinn’s voice.

Quinn: Imagine if you could control gravity.

The camera cuts to show Hall busy at work on some monitors.

Quinn: If instead of drilling for oil, it rose up to greet you.

Cut back to Quinn.

Quinn: Imagine if you could move a super tanker’s worth of cargo with a swipe of your hand.

Cut back to inside the room with the full sized device. The robotic arm that lowered the black mass into place is now behind it, pushing it into the center of the device. We still hear Quinn talking.

Quinn: Well, we will do this and more.

Hall is busy punching things into the computer. We hear Coulson speaking while we watch Hall.

Coulson: This could have been a traumatic experience for Dr. Hall.

Cut to Coulson and Ward on the beach.

Coulson: He may not be the same when we find him, Ward. I’ll talk him down. We don’t want your personality to set him on edge.

Ward: Great time for humor, sir. My people skills are the least of our problems if Skye can’t get us in.

Cut to Skye walking down a hallway looking for a signal. She stops outside a set of double doors and pushes on them, it doesn’t open.

Skye: It’s locked, but there’s no lock.

Cut to The Bus, Fitz, holding the popcorn bowl and eating some, answers.

Fitz: Eh, check for a keypad.

Cut to Skye, she leans to the left side of the door then the right looking.

Skye: Nothing. Wait, you can hack a keypad?

She looks impressed. We cut to Fitz who’s face falls.

Fitz: No, not over the phone.

May: Is there a reception desk?

Skye looks to her right and sees a small desk set up in the hallway, she walks toward it.

Skye: Okay, yeah.

She gets to the desk.

Skye: Well, now what do I do?

Skye looks to her left when she hears Quinn’s voice.

Quinn: What are you trying to do?

She sets down her glass then looks at the desk.

Skye: Just…

She chuckles.

Skye: Looking for a pen.

She pulls one out and holds it up to him.

Skye: Here we go.

She laughs again, Quinn smiles but he’s not buying what she’s selling.

Skye: Got to write down all those good ideas, you know what I mean? Of course you know what I mean. You probably have like 10 pens for all your ideas.

Quinn: What are you really doing?

She looks nervous for a moment then seems to think of something.

Skye: All right. I’m busted. I was trying to get a glimpse behind your office doors, see how things really operate.

He takes a few steps closer to her.

Quinn: I invite you here as a guest, you treat me like another corrupt institution, looking for trade secrets to leak online.

He backs up from her and puts his phone near his mouth.

Quinn: Security.

Skye: No, no, no, wait.

He takes the phone down.

Skye: It’s just with all these la-di-da people, you have to be so guarded, so careful. What’d you say, what secrets you reveal.

She is leaning down to the desk, she appears to be writing something.

Skye: And…I was hoping that you and I could be honest with one another. If you know what I mean.

She holds up the piece of paper she was writing on, it says: SHIELD is listening. His face turns serious and she nods her head.

Commercial Break.

Open inside The Bus. Fitz, Simmons and May are still listening in. We can hear Skye’s voice over the intercom.

Skye: My office had less space, more wheels. Wow. A view of the ocean and the pool.

Quinn: Not a bad place to do business.

May: Got the dispatch leaking Hall’s location. User’s an alias.

Fitz: Oh, can you trace the DHCP server –

May: Trace is running, but it’ll take time. Our girl?

Simmons: I thought she was done for, but she’s just sweet talked her way into Quinn’s office.

May: How’d she manage that?

Fitz: Pbht! She probably just used her, um…

He has raised both of his hands up by his chest indicating her breasts.

Both Simmons and May shoot him a look and he starts to stammer.

Fitz: Uh…uh…her, uh…ah, boobs.

Simmons sighs.

Simmons: Ugh. That’s the only explanation –

She is cut off when the audio fee from Skye goes silent.

Simmons: Oh, my gosh, the signal’s dead.

She hits a button the gets worried.

Simmons: Fitz!

Fitz: What, I didn’t , she must’ve, oh lord.

Cut to Quinn’s compound. The earpiece Skye was wearing is dropped into a Champagne glass. Skye lets out a sigh.

Skye: Much better. Haven’t felt that “someone’s watching my every move” feeling since I failed my driver’s test.

Quinn: You want to tell me what the hell is going on?

He picks up the glass looking at the earpiece.

Quinn: S.H.I.E.L.D. got to you?

Skye: They picked me up in L.A., I helped them in a crisis, and now they want to recruit me.

Quinn: Of course they do.

He sets the glass down on his desk.

Skye: So, I played along, talk about inside info, I have a bunk on their plane. I’ve been gathering intel, biding my time until I could become useful. I thought this qualified.

Quinn: Why would they trust you with a covert operation like this?

Skye: Something about S.H.I.E.L.D. not breaking international laws. They had no other options, whereas I like to keep mine open.

Cut to Coulson and Ward on the beach. The come across a sign that says: DO NOT CROSS LETHAL RADIATION. Coulson bites his lip then bends down and picks up some rocks. He throws them up in the air and they hit the laser grid, flashing yellow. Ward takes a deep breath and gives Coulson a look of worry.

Ward: Next patrol any minute now.

May’s voice comes to them over their earpieces.

May: Skye’s offline. Repeat, we’ve lost audio and vitals.

Ward: Abort is not an option, but if she’s compromising –

Coulson: She’s still our only way in to get to Dr. Hall.

Ward: And we’re their only way out.

We hear a man’s voice behind them.

Man: Beach is all clear. Let’s move up the ridge.

Coulson and Ward move quickly trying to find cover as guards come walking up toward them.

Cut back to Skye and Quinn, she is now sitting on the sofa in his office.

Skye: You’re saying they wanted to rope me in because I pose a genuine threat?

Quinn is standing next to one of the windows.

Quinn: Yes, and fit their profile.

Skye: Profile?

Quinn: Sure. You’re a criminal. You have a warrant somewhere.

She scoffs.

Skye: Probably.

Quinn: Specialized skill set.

Skye: I try to stay humble, but fail.

Quinn: No family.

Skye has no quip for this, she lowers her eyes for a moment.

Quinn: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hit a nerve, but that is what these people do. S.H.I.E.L.D.

He leans in close to her.

Quinn: They prey on fear and loneliness and desperation, and then they offer a home to those who have no one else to turn to. I can offer you something better.

She looks away.

Cut back to the beach. The guards have crested the top of the ridge where Coulson and Ward are hiding. Coulson rushes out of some bushes and knocks the lead security guard’s hand away from his gun. Ward fights another as Coulson takes down his. In short order they have the guards knocked out. Coulson took one of their guns and takes the clip out, he goes to clear the chamber but has a problem.

Coulson: Damn. A little rusty, I guess.

Ward takes the gun out of his hands and casually throws it into the laser grid, it goes up in a puff of smoke.

Coulson: Guy’s clocks ticking. Where’s Skye?

Cut back to Skye and Quinn.

Quinn: Stay with us, there’s no secrets, no lies and no agenda. You’re free to do what you do without big brother watching over you.

Quinn stands and walks to sit next to Skye on the sofa.

Quinn: But first, you have to tell me exactly what agenda S.H.I.E.L.D. sent you in here with.

Skye: Well, they wanted me to do whatever it takes to get in here.

She opens her purse and pulls out the compact. She looks at herself in the mirror and sees that there are red dots on the left side of the mirror.

Quinn: Get in here and…?

The lights suddenly go green. She runs a finger under one of her eyes.

Skye: Bat my eyes.

She snaps it closed then sets it on the table.

Skye: Get you talking.

Cut to The Bus. A despondent looking Simmons is leaning down over the table as May studies a monitor behind her. May quickly turns when she hears a beeping sound.

May: We’re in!

Simmons stands straighter.

Simmons: She’s done it!

May: Fitz, you’re up.

He quickly hurries over to the table.

Fitz: Oh, mother of all things.

He tries to cut in front of May to get at the table.

Fitz: Move, move, move!

He is quickly typing away.

Cut to Coulson and Ward, they have tied the hands of the security guards. A voice comes over the security guards radio.

Man: We have a man down! Hostiles on the east ridge!

Coulson and Ward both duck when gunfire hits around them. They run to the laser grid but find it still one when a bullet hits it.

Coulson: We need a reset here, Fitz!

Cut to The Bus, Fitz is still furiously typing.

Cut back to Coulson and Ward. They continue to duck from incoming fire as Ward pulls out his gun.

Coulson: Fitz!

Cut back to The Bus, Fitz is still working.

Simmons: Saying his name repeatedly does not increase productivity!

Fitz: Okay, go.

Simmons: Oh, maybe it does.

The monitor behind Fitz and Simmons shows a countdown of three seconds.

Cut to Coulson and Ward, the grid goes down and they rush through. We can hear Fitz voice over their earpieces.

Fitz: System rebooting in two, one, now!

For some reason Ward has waited until the last possible moment to dive through the opening. A shot is fired at them but it hits the grid instead of them. With the cover of the grid they hurry away. We next see them walking up some stairs toward the house.

Coulson: I’ll look for Dr. Hall down in the lab.

Ward: I’ll get Skye.

They split up.

We cut to Skye and Quinn.

Quinn: No, you can’t be the only angle. S.H.I.E.L.D.’s thorough enough to know about me and my exploits. It takes more than a pretty face to disarm me.

A large man enters the room.

Large Man: Sir, we have a security breach.

Quinn gets off the sofa quickly.

Skye: Oh, the timing on that was perfect.

Quinn lets out a sigh and picks up her compact. He takes one look at it then breaks it in two and throws down the pieces. He turns to the large man, pats the large mans’ chest, and then pulls out his gun and points it at Skye.

Cut to inside the lab where Dr. Hall is still working over his monitor. The door opens and Coulson enters.

Coulson: Dr. Hall.

Coulson enters the room, shoots a glance at the device, then turns his attention back on Hall.

Coulson: Agent Coulson, we have an exit strategy.

Hall isn’t look at him, he’s paying attention to the device.

Hall: S.H.I.E.L.D.?

Coulson: Yes, sir. Let’s get you out of here.

Coulson heads to the door but Hall’s voice stops him.

Hall: I’m sorry, Mr. Coulson, I’m right where I’m supposed to be.

He spares Coulson a brief glance then goes back to working on the device.

Coulson: I’ll be honest, our strategy did not take into consideration you saying that.

Cut to May on The Bus, she’s still trying to locate where the leak of Hall’s whereabouts came from. There are two messages on her screen: Alias Identified and Camera Memory Loading… Once it does load we see Dr. Hall looking at the camera, on the bottom of the screen it says: Alias DHCP Login Identified; Work Station 32.29.1 Camera Memory Accessed. May lets out a sigh.

May: Oh, no.

Cut back to Coulson in the lab with Hall. He’s standing in front of the device with his back to it not paying it much attention.

Coulson: Look, I don’t know what Quinn is promising you but –

Hall: An opportunity.

There are zapping noises coming from the device. This gets Coulson’s attention finally and he looks back at the device. The black undulating mass is now sparking blue with electricity and the rings around it are spinning. Coulson looks from the device to Hall.

Coulson: We can’t let Quinn have control of this. It’s too dangerous.

Hall: We can’t let anyone have control of this. That’s why I’m here, to bury it at the bottom of the ocean, with him.

The sounds of zapping have increased and how the rings are beginning to light up with power. Coulson steps closer to the glass separating them and looks at the device. May’s voice comes over Coulson’s earpiece.

May: Coulson.

Cut to May on The Bus.

May: The leak came from –

Cut back to Coulson still looking at the device.

Coulson: Dr. Hall. Yeah, I’m getting that.

Hall: All petitions, embargos in the world could stop Ian. He grows more powerful every day. And then I get word that he’s found this.

We see the device and the rings are spinning even faster. As we watch the whole thing seems to come alive with electricity. The force of it coming alive seems to rock the whole compound, Coulson is knocked back for a second.

Hall: I’m sorry, Mr. Coulson. I had to make a choice.

Hall hits another button and holds it, this seems to discharge the energy that’s been building. The cabinets in the room all open spilling out the contents and sending them toward the device.

Coulson: Something tells me that wasn’t the “off” button!

Suddenly Coulson is ripped off his feet and throw to the right out of frame.

Commercial Break.

We open back inside the lab. Coulson is knocked out on the floor with bottles and various things strewn around him. He wakes up with a gasp and puts his hand to his earpiece.

Coulson: Guys, we need to talk.

Cut to May, she’s walking down one of the sets of metal stairs, she puts her hand to her own earpiece.

May: Lost you for a minute. We’re aware of the problem, sir. Hall wanted Quinn to kidnap him?

May enters Fitz-Simmons’ lab, they are busy at work.

Fitz: Yeah, why would he do that?

Simmons: What is wrong with him?

Cut to Coulson still trying to get his bearings and get to his feet.

Coulson: Quinn built a gravity generator, like the one we found but bigger. Hall knew Quinn would need him to control its raw power, but Hall just wanted to unleash it.

Coulson has managed to get to his knees but grunts in pain.

Cut back to the lab on The Bus.

Simmons: The one that we found was 2.5 centimeters in diameter. It stopped a semi.

Cut back to Coulson.

Simmons: How big are we talking?

Coulson: 12 feet. It’ll definitely take down the entire compound.

Cut to the lab on the bus.

Simmons: It’ll skink the place.

Fitz: No, it’ll do more than that.

Cut to Coulson.

Coulson: Work a solution. I’ll disconnect the power before things get…

He’s finally able to stand taller on his knees. When he does he sees that he is hanging upside down on the ceiling. The only thing left on the real ground is the monitor Hall was using, and that’s cause it’s actually bolted to the floor.

Coulson: Crazy.

The camera does a 180 spin so that the room is right for us from Coulson’s perspective. As the camera spins Hall enters the room holding a gun.

Hall: They can’t help you.

He walks over to the cabinet that held the bottle of booze and pulls it out showing it to Coulson with a smile.

Hall: Soon, It’ll reach and exponential acceleration state.

Hall has pulled a glass out of the cabinet. He bends down and picks up a chair righting it. Coulson gets off the floor and stands. Hall is looking at the device so Coulson looks at it too.

Hall: I’m sorry.

The device is spinning really face, all the lines are glowing on it.

Coulson: My team’s here, good people.

Hall: Sworn to protect all mankind? That’s what I’m doing, I promise. Making things right.

He holds up his glass at a weird angle and pours his drink, the liquid goes sideways. He chuckles then takes a drink. Suddenly the whole room shifts. Coulson is thrown against a wall as Hall stands and his chair his swept away from him. Hall’s starts walking with an exaggerated slant to his body.

Cut to a Skye and Quinn. Quinn pushes Skye against the wall with one hand holding her neck and the other holding the gun to her head.

Quinn: Don’t you get it? S.H.I.E.L.D.’s against everything you stand for. They’re Big Brother.

Skye: Maybe. But they’re the nice Big Brother who stands up for his helpless little brother when he’s getting beat up because he ate a piece of cake that he wasn’t…

Skye is rambling and Quinn looks lost.

Skye: You know…you kidnapped a person!

Quinn gets upset at this, he releases Skye and steps away from her.

Quinn: I set him free! I saved him!

Skye massages her neck once it’s free.

Quinn: And I could’ve saved you.

Cut to Ward, he enters a hallway and looks around

Ward: This place is massive.

He chooses to go left.

Cut to The Bus. There is map of the compound up on the monitor in the lab. May is there, along with Fitz-Simmons, leading Ward.

Ward: Where am I heading?

May: Southwest corner.

We cut back to Ward. He starts to move but then stops, the device is starting to affect the gravity above.

May: Ward, tell me you’ve got things covered on the ground.

Cut back to The Bus.

May: I can’t do a damn thing from out here.

Cut back to Ward, he’s looking around trying to figure out what’s happening.

Ward: I’m working on it.

He goes the opposite way down the hallway.

Cut to Skye and Quinn, the ground below them rocks causing them to lose their balance. Quinn becomes even more upset.

Quinn: Tell me what they’re doing!

Skye remains silent and looks scared, Quinn lowers his voice and puts softness in it.

Quinn: Tell me what they’re doing. You have to talk. You have no other way out of this.

He laughs and pulls his gun up to point at her head again.

Quinn: You’re expendable to S.H.I.E.L.D. They sent you in here with nothing.

Skye busts out the move Ward taught her on The Bus, disarming Quinn of his gun. She points it at Quinn and his bodyguard.

Skye: They taught me a few things.

Security Guard: Kids got balls.

Skye: Thanks but, yuck.

Quinn: But, do you have what it takes to pull the trigger?

Skye thinks about this, her eyes go wide.

Skye: Nope.

She drops the gun, runs out the door and leaps off the balcony into the pool below.

Cut back to inside the room with Quinn.

Quinn: Get her.

The second body guard rushes past Quinn and the first toward the doorway. They are all once again knocked around from the device. This time Quinn falls to the floor. There are two pins there and for a moment they balance on their points, then lower. Quinn rolls his eyes.

Quinn: Hall. We have to evacuate. Get the chopper. Now!

The guard hurry to do his bidding.

Cut back to inside the compounds lab. The device is running even faster now. Coulson is sliding along one of the walls, going upwards toward the ceiling. Hall gets to his feet and points the gun on Coulson.

Hall: All I had to do to get access to Quinn’s lab was drop little clues, create puzzles for him to solve. Quinn likes to feel smart.

Coulson: So you leaked your location. Why not try reasoning with him?

Hall: You can’t reason with an addict, and he’s addicted to exploiting opportunities. He never gives a thought to the friends, ecosystems, future generations left ruin in his wake.

Coulson: Like Agents Fitz and Simmons, your former students?

Hall drops the gun down taking this in.

Coulson: I’ve got them in my ear right now telling me you’re not a bad guy. We could’ve worked with you on this.

The devices powers up more and sends out another blast knocking them around. Hall maintains his footing but Coulson falls to the floor.

Hall: S.H.I.E.L.D.?

Hall gets upset.

Hall: S.H.I.E.L.D. is just as guilty of the same thing, experimentation without thought of consequences! Your search for an unlimited power source, brought an alien invasion.

Coulson nods his head.

Coulson: Fair point.

The room rocks again and Hall falls to his knees, he is still pointing the gun at Coulson however. Coulson tries to regain his footing.

Hall: This element is far too powerful for you, for him, for anyone! I don’t have to tell you that.

Another tremor rocks the room.

Hall: You’re feeling it now.

Once again the room shifts causing them both to lose their footing.

Cut to outside, a helicopter takes flight. It seems like the party is still going on but all the party goers and help staff are frightened and trying to figure out what’s going on. Skye runs past them. She stops for a moment, figures out where she is and continues running. She sees a couple of security guards appear from a flight of steps and turns to run the other way. One guard comes up from that way blocking her escape. The two behind her catcher her and hold her by her arms.

Skye: No, no, no, no! Please, please!

Ward suddenly appears behind the one guard, when the guard turns Ward elbows him in the face then fights him. The other two guard release Skye and fight Ward. Ward quickly takes the three guard out. Once she’s sure the guards are down Skye rushes to Ward, she is nearly clinging to him and panting with fright.

Ward: Are you hurt?

She shakes her head.

Ward: Just follow my orders. I’ll get us out of here.

He takes her hand and leads her away.

Cut to inside the lab where all hell is breaking lose. Papers, bottles, people and a gun are flying all around the room. Hall gets to the gun before Coulson can but Coulson is able to hit Hall when they both stand up. He knocks Hall down and takes control of the gun.

Hall: I see the future, Mr. Coulson, and it’s a catastrophe.

Now that the room is calm we can see that the “floor” now is actually the wall with the window that leads into the device.

Coulson: I just see a lot of people in trouble.

He pulls a wire down from the wall causing sparks.

Coulson: Nothing, Fitz-Simmons?

Cut to the lab on The Bus.

Coulson: I tried to cut the power. It’s still going.

They both sit up straighter.

Fitz: You need to find a catalyst.

Simmons: Find a catalyst. Something to create a chemical reaction in the core.

Cut back to the lab in the compound.

Coulson: It’s not too late to do the right thing. Help me find a catalyst.

Hall: I am doing the right thing, a completely selfless act. I know that history never celebrates what didn’t happen. They’ll call this a – a tragedy.

The camera pans over to show Ward and Skye looking in the little window on the door.

Hall: They won’t understand the good I did here.

We cut to Coulson, he sees them but keeps his attention on Hall.

Coulson: Killing innocent people?

Hall looks insulted.

Hall: Saving millions. We have to live with the choices we make, but sometimes we have to die with them, too.

Coulson lowers his gun.

Coulson: I understand. You made a hard call.

Hall: Yes.

Coulson: And now I have to make mine.

He fires the gun into the window below them, the one that leads directly into the device. Coulson jumps up and grabs a wire hanging above his head. Hall isn’t so lucky. He drops through the open window and falls into the device. The undulating black mass envelopes Hall in slow motion eventually covering his body and face. Once this happens everything in the room falls into its proper place with gravity returned to normal – this includes Coulson. The door opens and Ward and Skye enter. Coulson looks at the device and Ward and Skye do the same. The undulating black mass is still as it was, no bigger having absorbed Hall, and the rings slow to a stop. Skye and Ward both shoot a look to Coulson then look back at the device.

Cut to some sort of security footage. There is a young looking man on the screen and Coulson is speaking to him from The Bus.

Coulson: Say it back to me.

Young Agent: Deepest level of the fridge, unmarked vault, no access granted.

Behind the Young Agent a forklift is backing up then pulling away, we can see the device has just be unloaded from it.

Coulson: And no recorded entry, I don’t want this listed. I don’t want it flagged for the slingshot.

We can now see that it looks like the device was loaded onto a truck, they are closing the doors in the background.

Coulson: Anyone finds out, you’re responsible, and suffering. Understood?

Young Agent: Yes, Sir.

Coulson: That’s what Hall would’ve wanted.

We hear a beep of the feed cutting out and Coulson turns to his desk and sighs. He picks up his gun and looks at it with confusion.

Coulson: I used to have this down.

He is obviously still caught up in the fact that he couldn’t disarm the gun on the beach earlier. He’s trying to do it with his own pistol.

Coulson: Should be just muscle memory.

He’s having no luck. We hear May’s voice off screen.

May: You’re making a habit of it, sir.

May is standing in the doorway leaning against it with her arms crossed.

Coulson: Trying. Guess I’m a little rusty.

May: Of these close calls, I mean.

Coulson looks up from his gun at her words.

May: I don’t enjoy running back end.

Coulson turns to face her after setting down his gun.

Coulson: You want off the plane? Go ahead.

May stands up straight and walks toward Coulson.

May: I want in.

She stops before him and puts her hands behind her back, standing up straight.

May: Reporting for combat next time it’s up.

Coulson: You committed to the cause or just watching my back?

She gives a ghost of a smile.

May: Same thing.

She starts away.

May: And you are a little rusty.

With that she leaves as Coulson smiles.

Cut to the cargo area, Skye is there punching the bag. Ward enters from above and looks down at her with a smile. After a second he walks down the stairs. Skye shows no indication he’s there, but she knows. While they speak she continues to hit the bag.

Skye: You and your brothers, where’d you grow up?

Ward: Massachusetts, mostly.

Skye: A house?

Ward: You didn’t?

This question causes her to stop hitting, she steadies the bag and looks at Ward.

Skye: One house.

She walks away from the bag messing with the tape around her hands. She passed by Ward still standing on the last stair, when she does he follows after.

Skye: The Brodys.

She picks up a water bottle taking a drink.

Skye: I was 9. Sent me back to St. Agnes after a month. Said I wasn’t a good fit.

Ward: Foster parents. Your first?

Skye: My third.

Ward walks a bit closer to her.

Skye: I had heard it before, but…this one was different.

She looks down sadly.

Ward: Cause you wanted them to like you.

Now she looks up at Ward, he gets it, and she nods.

Skye: Bad.

She looks away seeming lost in the memories.

Skye: I called her “mom” once, tried it out.

She lets out a deep sigh then walks back over to the bag.

Skye: Guess it wasn’t a good fit.

She begins to hit the bag again.

Skye: Hoping for something and losing it hurts more than never hoping for anything.

Ward walks over to the bag and holds the opposite side from Skye. After a second she looks at him.

Ward: We won’t turn our back.

Skye: Doesn’t matter. I made my choice. I want this. Bad.

She gets into punching, Ward nods and holds the bag tighter.

Skye: And I know there’s a truth serum.

Ward: Whatever you say, Rookie.

Title logo.

Cut to some sort of vault. Inside is the black undulating box, it is housed inside a clear glass box. Two men push the heavy vault door shut as we cut inside the vault. We see the black mass from the backside as the Young Agent watches on as the vault is closed. The camera pans down to the mass and we watch it ripple and move.

We cut outside the vault, the two men get the door closed and spin the wheels locking it. The two men move away ad Young Agent walks to the door. He twists one of the wheels more securing the lock. There is a marker on the door: L23-826-59. Young Agent removes the marker from the door. He puts it inside a inside coat pocket and walks away.

Cut to inside the vault, we are once again looking at the black mass from the backside. It continues to ripple when suddenly a hand shoots out of it reaching before it is suddenly sucked back inside the mass.",Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1964,"[68, 61, 63, 68, 77, 95, 95, 97]",8

Ooh
Foolish of me, I could not see
The forest for the trees
You have been so true

Oh, girl please do not leave me

If you stay I will find a way
To erase the past
Baby do not leave me

What can I say to make you stay
Baby, do not leave me

It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you

Tell me girl, it is not too late
And you give me a chance
To make it up to you
Do not take your love from me
Girl do not take your love
Do not take your love

[Verse 2]
Girl, if you take your love away from me
I am going to be in misery
Your love is the strength that I lean upon
How will I make it when it is gone
Of all the little things I wanted to say
I really wanted to do
Girl , this time
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it

[Chorus]
So tell me girl, it is not too late
And you will give me a chance
To make it up to you

Baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded
Girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Aww yeah, aww yeah, my sound is what up right now
I've been down, but I'm up right now
Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'
Through that lane that you left open
Man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate, is it true?
'Cause I tried to make this shit work
But it seems like you was in your feelings
You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business
But I just got one question, baby
Tell me why?

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Started from the bottom like Drake said
You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead
My squad'll  kick in your door where that safe at
No Atari, games girl I don't play that
If she broke I don’t acknowledge her, everything I say I follow up
What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin' on these hoes
Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us
Made a little money, still ain't got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open, don't say nothin'
Motor geeked up like a razor
You don't know me, you must mistake me
For somebody else
But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him
I had to tell her that

413,Giving Up,"[Intro]
Yes
Sometimes I feel like giving up
It's that real hip hop

[Hook]
I sell dope everyday just to make a cut
Police in the hood say, ""Try your luck,""
Metaphor to my life
I'm not grinding enough
I feel like giving up

[Verse 1]
Man, there's time in my life I feel like giving up
All this hate that I hear
Man I heard enough
Mom told that I need to go get a job
Drug dealer in the hood tryna get me to rob
I really feel like the pressure of money
People live five cars, big houses
That ain't me
I'm tryna figure out how I'm goin' eat
I was shopping Whole Foods
But that shit ain't cheap
So I'm buying cheeseburgers four times a week
Drinking Hennessy right before I sleep
People don't understand cause I don't tell no one
Sometimes I really feel like getting a gun
We was born into a gang
Old rules, old news
Written the books people think we supposed to
I ain't goin' lie, don't compare me to those dudes
Who say the rap game, everybody eating they head
If you ain't gotta cut then it's try your luck
Sometimes I really wonder if my time is up
Cool people die for the strangest things
I understand the game and I play for free
My head hurt, walking around all this damn debris
I feel like sitting back and just pushing weed
The feds on my back wanna catch the cat
I need green eggs and ham, bitch,
And a sandwich
The world gone
The shit bigger
It's my family, some people say I'm insane
Albert Eistein
Way too blessed with the hearing and hindsight
It's way more than rap
It's the pain
Niggas see it, put em' to shame
And you see me cry, but I never complain
I'll build your house or I'll a drive plane
Niggas come in my house
You gotta respect the game
The gun make you feel like the Jetsons came
Oakland, what it do?
Berkley, what it do?
Richmond, what it do?
I'm still depressed
And I drive Bentley coups
Still in the hood
With the 9s in the roof, you feel me?
I ain't goin' lie
Niggas lying, I'm the truth
Fuck what you heard, I'mma tell you what I know
This that word from God, I'mma tell you from my soul
If I lied everyday than I wouldn't grow
I'm not no pimp
I'm not no corporate ass ho
That pimp with a suit and a mask on
Them fake motherfuckers wanna lay on the asphalt
But nonviolence is the best protest
Niggas, fuck your guns and fuck your vest
If you love Lil B than I love you to death
Niggas, life good
Motherfucker I'm stressed
I'mma turn that stress into some motherfucking pressure
Pressure make diamonds,
Lay em' on the dresser
Shout out to Casey, don't go back to jail
You say,""Fuck the police,"" but the police love you
They wear a suit and they looking for your suit
I love earth and I'm happy
Pray we all survive, you feel me?
Most people in the hood only talk with knives
Short tempers and them bullshit lies
Putting kids through hell
I don't respect those guys, you feel me?
Suckers at the top, haters at the bottom
And you goin' stay right there
I don't lie nigga, I stay right here

[Bridge]
We won't give up
We won't give up
We won't give up
We goin' make it
We won't give up
We won't give up
We won't give up
We goin' make it
We won't give up
We won't give up
We won't give up
Lil B, you goin' make it

[Hook]
I sell dope everyday just to make a cut
Police in the hood say, ""Try your luck,""
Metaphor to my life

Je ne suis qu'une fille du port
Qu'une ombre de la rue...

Pourtant je vous ai frôlé
Quand vous passiez hier
Vous n'étiez pas peu fier
Dame! Le ciel vous comblait:
Votre foulard de soie
Flottant sur vos épaules
Vous aviez le beau rôle
On aurait dit le roi...
Vous marchiez en vainqueur
Au bras d'une demoiselle
Mon Dieu!... Qu'elle était belle...
J'en ai froid dans le coeur...

Dire qu'il suffit parfois
Qu'il y ait un navire
Pour que tout se déchire
Quand le navire s'en va...
Il emmenait avec lui
La douce aux yeux si tendres
Qui n'a pas su comprendre
Qu'elle brisait votre vie
L'amour, ça fait pleurer
Comme quoi l'existence
Ça vous donne toutes les chances
Pour les reprendre après...

Allez, venez, Milord!
Vous avez l'air d'un môme!
Laissez-vous faire, Milord
Venez dans mon royaume:
Je soigne les remords
Je chante la romance
Je chante les milords
Qui n'ont pas eu de chance!
Regardez-moi, Milord
Vous ne m'avez jamais vue...
...Mais vous pleurez, Milord?
Ça je l'aurais jamais cru!

Eh bien, voyons, Milord!
Souriez-moi, Milord!

Ooh, just ain't enough love
Ooh, just ain't enough love

[Verse 1]
These are the words my baby spoke
As she bid her last goodbye
With tears in my eyes as she walked from my side
I sadly asked her why

[Chorus]
And she said, ""Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love""
(""Just ain't enough love"")
She said, ""Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love""
(""Just ain't enough love"")

[Verse 2]
Now I was too busy, but that girl of mine
I'd buy her gifts from time to time
So sure this would satisfy, 'til she up and left me
With this reply

[Chorus]
She said, ""Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love""
(""Just ain't enough love"") I gotta leave you
Because, ""Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love""
(""Just ain't enough love"")
She said, She said, ""Ooh, ooh,"" that's what she told me
(""Just ain't enough love"")
And she said, ""Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love""
(""Just ain't enough love"")

[Verse 3]
I said, sweet thing, sweet thing, please don't leave
I'm so sorry I made you grieve
So confident pretty words would make her stay
But this is what she said
As she turned and walked away

[Chorus]
She said, ""Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love""
(""Just ain't enough love"")
She said, ""Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love""
(""Just ain't enough love"")
Ain't enough love, baby, (""Ooh, ooh,"")
That's what she told me (""Just ain't enough love"")
Ain't enough love baby (""Ooh, ooh,"")

416,A Little Toy Balloon,"[Intro]
You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, ""Something's out there""
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by

[Interlude]

[Verse 1]
99 red balloons
Floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine, it springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
As 99 red balloons go by

[Verse 2]
99 Decision Street
99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call out the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it, boys, this is war
The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by

[Verse 3]
99 knights of the air
Ride super high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a super hero
Everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scramble in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by
99 red balloons go by

[Verse 4]
99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In this dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here...
And here is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go",Nena,1964,"[84, 86, 86, 89]",4
417,If You See My Love,"You've fallen right out of the sky
I could swear you're a natural high
Volcanoes erupting inside, when I see the sparkle in your eyes
But you don't even realize, cause you've been hurt so many times
They played with your heart, told you lies, these were wrong all along you were right

But if you could see my love through a bird's eye
Will you would know how beautiful it is to

Fly, baby fly, we got to fly to stay alive
These words, these words, No magic till we try
Take a leap, leap of fate
Reach for the stars in the night
Break the curse, of this earth
There's miracles up in the sky where love birds fly

Like angels from heaven on earth
With no love they will never die
With dust of the pain and the dirt
And discover a diamond inside
I'm not saying I'm the perfect man, but I swear I will give it a try
I'm no pilot I, got no wings but I, I know we will survive

Cause if you could see a love through a bird's eye
Will you would know how beautiful it is to

Fly, baby fly, we got to fly to stay alive
These words, these words, No magic till we try
Take a leap, leap of fate
Reach for the stars in the night
Break the curse, of this earth
There's miracles up in the sky where love birds fly",MaNga,1964,"[92, 97]",2

Oh, when I come
To the end of my journey
Weary of life
And the battle is won

419,My Heart Skips A Beat,"The best thing is to walk away
Before they push you out the door
Fall back into yesterday
No need to worry anymore
Focus on an empty page
Lay it down and let it show
It’s in you to make the change
It’s everything you’ve ever known
My heart skips a beat
My lungs are spread
My legs quiver
My ears prick up again
My limbs feel weak
And my mind shimmers
Now I’m on the other side
Gazing down from such a height
It’s easier to let it slide
And wake up when I’m in full flight
The scene is playing out once more
But now I’m watching from above
It’s different than it was before
But it’s you that I’m still thinking of
My heart skips a beat
My lungs are spread
My legs quiver
My ears prick up again
My limbs feel weak
And my mind shimmers
My heart skips a beat
My lungs are spread
My legs quiver
My ears prick up again
My limbs feel weak
And my mind shimmers",TOY,1964,"[94, 100]",2
420,Like Columbus Did,"Lunar

Hook (2x): But still I'm rapping, I'm running just for the fun of it while they out here like come discover me like Columbus did

Oh nah you can't deal with this type of fire power. I'm Eisenhower when I devour the mic and inspire cowards to strike then I... Step to the podium. I'm causing pandemonium. Knowing that I'm the only one going doper than opium.. But still I'm fond of this congregating solution. My misconfusion sought an illusion that I'm abusing. Take me out of this situation, I'm using a special fusion of anticipation and evisceration concluding that I'm out of here. Into a special planet. My critical mind state, it can be so inevitable. No leverage dude, but still I be paid like revenues. In my head, I'm dealing, constantly waiting, thinking of an ultimatum. Ultimately caught me out of my element. I'm always elevating, you'll never see me be hesitant. And if you cannot find me, and I'm not found in my residence then I'll be heaven sent. That's irrelevant. Making the best of it

Hook (2x): But still I'm rapping, I'm running just for the fun of it while they out here like come discover me like Columbus did

If you're barely scared of me, then imma be... Monstrous bombing this, I'm on top of this so I would just... See into another world with opposite visions like it was oculus, I'm omnipotent whenever I'm dropping this. Cause evidently, I'm an epidemic feeling empty. The people I influence are the people that represent me. And I... definitely will not resign cause of the fact. There's nothing holding me back. But I don't condone the vocal to rap. Still I resemble a confident hypochondriac. Thank you for not sleeping on me like an insomniac. Cause at this point in time I would've lost it, I'm so exhausted. But all these mainstream rappers keepin' me cautious. Only.. We're not alike, I leave the microphone assaulted. But I wonder what it would cost to be the highest exalted in this rapping state. But I wasn't made to over compensate. I contemplate on all of the reasons why I can't concentrated

But I put the unity in opportunity. I flow so fluently, cause usually it you and I. With my.. Feet to the planet, then I seize to command it my hand has planet the moon. Never pause still I resume then ask... What's this community without communication? Still I spit revelations with a lack of an education. I.. Seek for the best, I'm obsessed with investigation. I keep on blessing the nation, you ain't gonna test my patience. See I keep it elliptic. I never stop, I keep on drifting. This ain't for the simple, well yea it's made for the cryptic. On the other hand, I measure the weight that I've been lifting. And I'm expecting that I'm perfecting on my perspective. When I'm wasting every second I'm given, yet it's reflected on how I'm respected off of my work that I've been correcting. But still I'm rapping. I'm running just for the fun of it. While you out here like come discover me like Columbus did

And though I loved him so
He cared for someone else
So sad to see him go
I need him so

And here I'll stay till who knows when

But suddenly, I thought of you, who used to always be with me
So I just started to tear up

As I walked down the street, I heard that familiar song
It makes me think of those times we used to listen to it together

Tears come
Because I ate so deliciously by myself
I want to be with you like before
Did you know
That I was most comfortable with you out of anyone in the world?
More than anyone else, more than a long-time friend

Tears come
Because I had so much fun watching a movie by myself
I want to watch it with you like before
Did you know
That I liked you the most of anyone in the world?
No one else could win you

Taking my picture and sending it to you sometimes
Texting each other as soon as we wake up
Those little, everyday things
I miss those things like crazy
I’m like that

Now I even miss
The memories of us fighting
What kind of person was I to you?
I want to talk
About this and that and what happened today
I want to do all of these things with you again

Whatever it was, we did it together

Because I miss you so much
Because I miss you
Tears come

445,Everybody Knows,"[Verse 1]
Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died
Everybody talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long-stem rose
Everybody knows

[Verse 3]
Everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Oh, give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
Everybody knows

[Chorus]
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

[Verse 4]
And everybody knows that it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
And everybody knows that you live forever
When you've done a line or two
Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old Black Joe's still picking cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows

[Verse 5]
And everybody knows that the plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows

[Verse 6]
And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
Before it blows
Everybody knows",Sigrid,1964,"[74, 72, 73, 78, 100]",5

Qué ingrata ha sido la vida que no me acaba de matar
Jamás olvido ese día: 15 de noviembre a las 12 del día

[Coro: Romeo Santos & Kiko Rodríguez]
La vi en el altar, precisamente cuando el Padre los unió
Mi mundo colapsó al momento
Su boda iba a parar, pero elegí que sea feliz
Causando incrementar mi sufrimiento
La vi en el altar, una diadema en su cabeza
Y aquel novio se llevó lo que más quiero
La imagen no puedo borrar, quiero sacar de mi memoria
Su vestido blanco, el anillo en su dedo y el beso que no le di

[Puente: Romeo Santos & Kiko Rodríguez]
Ay, mami
Sube la canción que quiero llorar
Con amor: Kiko Rodríguez
She won't forget, Romeo, ah-ah

Ella no dio despedida
Ni me invitó a la catedral
Por los chismosos del pueblo
Llegué hasta la Iglesia, murieron mis sueños

481,Shangri-La,"[Verse 1: Skizzy Mars]
I think our whole approach is wrong
Yeah, I think that we're not thinkin' right
Vodka and sprite. Tell me what ya like
We're like good people with bad time
And it's like our comments, vodka tonics, and awkward silence
But, I don't know
While I'm here, I just feel alive
I just feel alive. Yeah
I live like I could die any minute
But I feel like I could fly, yeah (I could fly)
It's sixty degrees in downtown New York
I love the way your autumn hair is fallin' off your shoulders
I'm slowly drivin' you around in the two door, top down
At least until it gets colder
Oh, you smoke? I got it
I got some tropics
I didn't do well in school, but weed's my favorite topic
Now, this whole infatuation, it needs to stop
It needs to stop. Yeah, I need to stop it
Short fuses, but tall orders
Don't let the wine spill in your high heels
Let's watch the time pass, with your fine ass
Yeah, red lipstick on that wine glass
It's fucked up, givin' lap dances
That's a bar of tequila and lorazepam
And since growin' up, I always knew I had a plan
Yeah, I didn't think that they would understand
So, we go red and cola on the rocks
She did a few lines before she got...
Over to my crib (over to my crib)
And, I told her like
Listen, yo I love you like New York
I love you like weed on a Sunday morning
Waking up to you moaning and yawning
I love you like the color blue
That's my favorite color you
Don't know what you do to me
I'm tryna do this thing with you
When I'm with these other hoes, all I do is think of you
I don't want to settle down
It seems like that's what people do
This is new, but maybe it's the fact that I'm in love with you
That I'm in love with you

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]
You like Skrillex?
Well I just copped a dubstep
And we can get high and gaze into the sunset
Head enjoy the present and disregard what's next (what's next)
I said Verona, will you finish that Corona?
Everything that you do extra just because you so special
And, I'm just lovin' your fragrance
We just bumpin' the latest
We prolly drank a bit too much, cuz now I'm feelin' faded
And I always open doors
I always have the answers to the questions you're unsure of
Never felt this shit, but I do anything for love
Said, never had it
I do anything for love
And we can do all of these kisses and hugs
Or we can do it even looser and disregard with a shrug
If you doin' something that I really don't approve of
I'll be gettin' kinda jealous and I know you've heard enough
Heaven's gon' be better than this life I'm livin'
Smokin', watchin' the Simpsons, makin' big decisions

Tear it all apart
Make the teardrops fall
From your eyes
And you'll know how I feel
When he holds you
Whenever he holds you

Pretend no one loves you
Make believe you're blue

And if you get an empty feeling deep inside
Then you'll know how I feel
When he holds you
Whenever he holds you

My friends say forget you
I know I should try
But whenever he holds you, I feel I could die

But if you ever find
That I'm still on your mind
Maybe you'll come back to my arms

See the people who stop and stare and say
Haven't I seen that face somewhere a long time ago

See the stranger who says 'why, hi'
With a 'how you goin', buddy'
When you walked on by I thought I'd say hallo

They say: haven't I seen your face before
Weren't you the boy that used to live next door
Weren't you on television every night
Haven't I seen you round

Yesterday's hero, that's all I'll be
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero

All that I'll be if I don't get together now

When you walk down the streets
If you know me, then pass me by
If you wonder what I'm doing
Don't ask me why I don't read the news
When you walk down the streets
If you're sorry then don't feel bad
If you followed my story
Then just be glad you ain't in my shoes

Because haven't you seen my face before
Yes, I was the boy who used to live next door
Yes, I was on television every night
Haven't you seen me round

The next man I get has got to promise me to be mine, all mine!

Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days
Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days;
It seems like trouble going to follow me to my grave

I ain't never loved but three men in my life;
I ain't never loved but three men in my life:
My father, my brother, the man that wrecked my life

It may be a week, it may be a month or two
It may be a week, it may be a month or two
But the day you quit me, honey, it's comin' home to you

I got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand
I'm gonna hold it until you meet some of my demands",Bessie Smith,1964,[99],1

490,Tea For Two,"I'm discontented with homes that I've rented
So I have invented my own
Darling, this place is lovely oasis
Where life's weary taste is unknown
Far from the crowded city
Where flowers pretty caress the stream
Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in
Don't let it apart in my dream
Picture me upon your knee
Just tea for two
And two for tea
Just me for you
And you for me alone
Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations
We won't have it known
That we own a telephone, dear
Day will break and I'll wake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For you to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A boy for you
And a girl for me
Can't you see how happy we would be
Picture you upon my knee
Just tea for two
And two for tea
Just me for you
And you for me alone

Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

And what do you wish?""
The old moon asked the three
""We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beautiful sea
Nets of silver and gold have we""
Said Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in the wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

Well the little stars where the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
""Now cast your nets where ever you wish
Never afraid are we""
So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

'Twas all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
But some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And a Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee-one's trundle bed

Of the beautiful sights that be
You will see the wonderful things
As you rock in the misty sea

When I across the street
نشوف كان الوجوه لي فادة
تعرف ديراكت بالحالة منيكة شادة
عباد صارت كالموتى من قلة المادة
فكة سرقة خطفة هذا من القحب الي ماده
زناقي تعدي تبدل شوارع طويلة
تسكنها ناس كي زومبي ببدانات عريانة هزيلة
تلقى فاها المجرم حتى تلقى الديلا
تلقى الي عندو متريز يخدم عساس في فيلا
I accross the street
وكل يوم تزيدني حاجة
عرفت بلي سبب الخراب هو الفقر و الحاجة
نعرف بلي الناس لكبار باش تبقى فراجة
كل ما نيكا الحالة قعدت انتي راكب الدراجة
مراجة حكومة باندية
تطمع في ملاوي رشاوي لبول تلم لوزارة المالية
ايجا انت منا توا نمدلك الهوية
وجهو موش عجبني شد اطلبلوا اقرب دورية
تشوف الناس ولات أنواع كل حد و حكايتو
تغزر في عينو تعرف شنوا أصلو و ربايتوا
تعكسلوا وجهو الي متوريوش مرايتو
ساعات تحكم على
العبد اول ما تسمع كنايتوا
رجال نساء كلوا بان عليه الفقر الهم
باين الي تعدى عليه الوقت عفس و ظلم
الي عكست بيه الي عادا الناس زاد استجرم
والا نقم يلوج على وين ينظم
هات ثم شيء مايفرح
تشوف في عمرك ذكرى في وشمك في زندك المجرح
كاتم صوتك انتي تضيق بيك تصرح
يالي جيت قبل في اليوم تصلح
تشوف الي يفلح طالع هابط في المنشار
مسكل تشوفوا جاية عليه تقول يا ستار
مادخلوا شيء في البيعة يولي أكبر سمسار
يشدلك وجهك كان لزم ينيك عليك الحصار
خنار شارع على كل اللون يا محن
عندك الشارف التالف وعندي صغير السن
فما الي مشكلتوا بياسة بعيدة وين يكن
فما الي عايش خربة فما بعيد على العود يدندن
I across the street
ليالي نشوف في الناس متحولة
كيف تطيح الظلمة تولي شيخت راسك اولى
كالعباد في السيفيل كلي مطولة
تسمع كان نيكم الحفرة قحبة نيك الدولة
شتحبني نعمل ما بيدي قوة لا حولا
هاني نعيش هكاكا لين يتذكرنا المولى
فما الي ناكو القمار يعدي ليلتوا
فما الي هزيتوا الخلطة لديار السكريتو
برشا ناس ملي تغيب الشمس ما تصحى
مخ موجود أما خسارة لحشيش ناكلوا مسحة
هروب من الواقع من ها الدنيا كسحة
ناس طاحت للشمة حتى من الصحون لسحة
وفات الفسحة بارشا مطيشة مكثر تحت الحيط متريشة
بالعة وافي ماعاد ساق تقوم بيه Drugs
صباح رباح لعباد ولات تعيق والديه
وقت في مكانه يحس بالدنيا تدور بيه

So silent you never scream

Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more

[Verse 1]
He marched around the corner like a soldier
But not to get no on-the-mic exposure
To question me, I guess he checking me, I’m feeling like
I’m looking at my own self in the face as deaths destiny awaits
Us both wearing vests’
Us both stressed from the same pressures
Us both fucking train-wreck reckless
Guns whip out, he had a .9, I had a .40
I remember a point in time where he had mine, I had his shorty
And I could cry telling this story
If you can visualize a downtown crowded street, somebody was eating
And saw P pull out his piece and decided to reach

On us like ""Police freeze!!""

Like nothing

Asked us what we got guns for, we told ‘em it’s for

""Proof, this one’s for you"" ""I love you, Doody""

[Chorus]
Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more

[Verse 2]
He marched up out his house like a soldier
Decided to titty-bar it
A lot of alcohol consumption and drug use
While out with the city’s hardest, niggas
Throwing money up with black face, flicking photos
The only thing he was missing was my nigga Dolo
He decided to leave them and go to an after-hour
After the 4-hour, he act crazier than Scarface after snorting powder
He get into it with this dude, point his piece at him
They say he shot him, problem is, I don’t believe that
And on the real I, only know shots flew
And when the smoke cleared they say he got killed by (Security)

[Pre-Chorus 2]

That

[Chorus]
Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more

[Verse 3]
I know y’all seen Beef III
And it probably made you think that I ain’t like Shady
The truth is, I was at Proof's funeral crying like a baby
I was sitting in the back row
With Vishis, wishing I can go up to Marshall
Denaun, Swifty, Obie, Bizarre, Paul or Von
And say something positive, after all the negative shit
That we been through, thinking we’d talk one day
If it was meant to reservations ’bout walking up there
And getting in the way, it’s probably better off to just pray
Thinking my niggas a Don, it was my first time
At an over 1000 people funeral with (Security)

He settles all the scores
He kills in plain sight
With a blade and a smile
Well he dont know what to think
He ain't had enough to drink
Will he take him by surprise
To see the whites of his eyes

Well he'll settle things in the sun
Plays god like the chosen one
Well he's storied from town to town
Kills for sport and pride

The matador raised his blade to the sun
To show the blade, the damage is done
Children cry in their mother's arms
As the people replied with a deafining swarm
The crowd rose as the blood's running warm

Crawling through a systematic maze
And it pains to demise
Pain in our eyes
Strain of drownin', wading into your lies

Inundated by media, virtual mind fucks in streams

Feet have bled a million miles we've walked
Revealing at the end of the day, the charade

Perpetrators beware say a prayer if you dare for the believers
With a faith at the size of a seed enough to be redeemed (doo doo)
Relegated to savages bound by the way of the deceivers
So anchors be sure that you're sure we ain't no amateurs

All we wanted was a chance to talk
'Stead we only got outlined in chalk
Feet have bled a million miles we've walked

First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

So, I'll rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

530,Stay Awhile,"[Intro]
What you wanna say to make me stay awhile
What you wanna say to make me wanna stay

[Verse 1]
Just me and my peeps we gettin buzzed, lookin for clubs
Misses with kisses and hugs, lookin for love
She gotta be nice with hers, even with cookin some grub
Once I'm in I meet her friends, then I'm hookin my thugs
We'll be blowin hundreds, always knowin where the fun is
Roadrunners findin more spots than Columbus
Pocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders
I take my time, and find where the right one is
Smooth as jazz but more than a half, ready for math
And on a steady path, like Betty Shabazz
And when I see the wiz I'mma step to my biz
And there she is, let's see if she pass the quiz
It's appropriate we go get soakin wet
Toast, we met, become close associates
The place is ours by now I can embrace your style
So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile

[Hook]
Why don't you, stay a little while
Stay, stay a little while, child
Baby, why don't you, stay a little while
Stay, ayyyayyy, stay a little while, child
Baby, why don't you

We on the low mating, infiltrating, negotiating
We both be makin moves and dough, M.O.'s relating
She ain't takin I want it but yo I know she waiting
I throw the bait in, and before you know we dating
I want the format, to the doormat
Contacts, fast callbacks and all that
Your deepest ecstasy see your accessories
Your secret recipes to your bear necessities
She real exotic body feel like Lucile Roberts
Name brand closets, culturized products
Claws like a scorpion caught me in deeper
But juice sweeter, enough to buy a two seater
Every mile I plan to have your mind beguiled
Til it informs me more than you would normally allow
Raised more than an eyebrow with a flagrant style
By now I can taste your smile, stay awhile

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it's hard to fight it and not let her see me get excited
But she know I like it, she know the deal like a psychic
Mind is haunted, because I always find her on it
She know what I want, where I want, when I want it
Blowin up my Motorola, daddy you comin over?
She on the sofa, holdin a remote controller
Candles burnin lower, favorite dish gettin colder
She hot as solar, cause I told her I wanna hold her
But her mission she sittin in one position like Yoga
A TV show is on to top it off she dead sober
Then I open the door up, and kiss her on the shoulder
She say I'm rollin, like Mr. Lover Lover
We had a hard day, ready to parlay
My thirsts they obey everything that God say
Okay let's play awhile and I'll embrace your style
So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile

I shouted to the driver, ""Hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus""

Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty-dollar bill and told him, ""Catch that yellow cab""

Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you, you're up to something new

Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

Feeling very sad inside
When all at once I saw in the sky
The little white cloud that cried

He told me he was very lonesome
And no one cared if he lived or died
And said sometimes the thunder and lightning
Make all little clouds hide

He said ""Have faith in all kinds of weather""
""For the sun will always shine""
""Do your best and always remember""
""The dark clouds pass with time""

He asked if I'd tell all my world

Keep my name out your mouth, I done said it befo'
Cause all them games I ain't 'bout, tell whoever you know
Befo' I pull this thang out, aim it dead at ya throat
Or bring the rifle out the house and put ya head in the scope
Pimp I'm trained for the drama shawty ready to go
See me hangin' out the hummer spittin' seventy mo'
You was talkin' 'bout a drought, I was peddlin' snow
And I doubt you'd get some blow as cheap as I'm sellin' it fo'
Hey I'm a G, what I'm worried 'bout a felony fo'?
When I get free bet I'll be ballin' hard as ever befo'
I got some chevy's but a benz what I'm usually in
Niggas hatin' on my crew I'll put a few in the wind
Keep it pimpin' till the end, while you choose to pretend
Shot a video in the pen and I'll do it again
Made news nationwide from eleven to ten
Headline CNN Peter Jennings and friends
Nigga, I'm so cool, been doing this since the old school
You turn into a gangsta when your vocals hit the Pro Tools
Ha! Look at him man
So don't get it confused, you don't know that dude
I'm hardcore no gold teeth, no tattoos
If you don't want no beef nigga don't act rude
I got a 4-4 fo' yo' attitude
We can talk or shoot it out, whatever you choose
Have it back in the county blues on the TV news
Only two rules when you walk in my shoes
One: Take no shit, number two: don't lose
I'm throwed off, plum fool nigga loose in my screws
Ima pass my patna the tool leave you wet as a pool
Lames get it misconstrued, g's you dont fool
I know bustin' a grape is somethin' you won't do
Super cool, nothin' to prove
I been bustin' them rugers and givin' you busters the blues
Since you were suckers in school
Hey, this is a situation you gon' wish you never pursued
You wanna push me? Pussy nigga do what you do
You think trappin' just in my flows? Nigga au contraire
Been sellin' blow since I was 12 years old my dear
Bustin' calicos just to let 'em know I'm here
Choppers in the trunk of every auto I steer
When you was in the classroom try'na pick a career
I was sellin' glass, countin' cash, drinkin' a beer
I agree this rap beef shit is so last year
But ask if I'll tear a new hole in your ass? Yeah
For flexin' and disrespectin', I don't play about that
But no mo' questions, I ain't got shit else to say about that
But my sentence'll be finished any day and I'm back nigga
Laughin' at you sucka ass hollywood rap niggas
Fakin' and they love it but this ain't for the public
So in interviews are cued to stay away from the subject
I just prove that I'm the truth if you don't like it then fuck it
We'll just keep it 'tween me you and this pistol I'm bustin', yeaaah
Pussy niggas ain't fuckin' wit' me
Cause pistol play in broad day that shit is nothin' to me
You need to pinch yourself nigga cause you livin' a dream
And I'm one of the realest niggas that this industry's seen
Think of me as John Gotti wit' a PhD
Or either Martin Luther King with a G-18
I'm ridin' clean, paint gleamin', blowin' T-H-C
For that reason haters wanna alleviate me
But I forgive 'em cause I know it ain't that he hate me
He just hate his situation hate that he ain't me
O.G.s say a lot of them in me they see
Cause I'm a scholar no diploma no GED
Now T.I.P. ain't sweet just so ya'll know
Had to tone it down for ya cause I know ya'll slow
Niggas tongue wrastle plenty yeah but they all show
Spread gossip like hoes 'bout what they don't know
Got mo' lies to tell than a nigga in jail
All my niggas from the streets I know remember me well
From how I used to take a key and put the weight on a scale
Now I'm seein' how many mills one record can sell nigga
You was on the low discussin' a g

561,Book Of Love,"[Verse 1]
The book of love is long and boring
No one can lift the damn thing
It's full of charts and facts and figures
And instructions for dancing

[Chorus 1]
But I
I love it when you read to me
And you
You can read me anything

[Verse 2]
The book of love has music in it
In fact that's where music comes from
Some of it is just transcendental
Some of it is just really dumb

[Chorus 2]
But I
I love it when you sing to me
And you
You can sing me anything

[Verse 3]
The book of love is long and boring
And written very long ago
It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes
And things we're all too young to know

[Chorus 3]
But I
I love it when you give me things
And you
You ought to give me wedding rings

And I
I love it when you give me things
And you
You ought to give me wedding rings
You ought to give me wedding rings",Peter Gabriel,1964,"[68, 62, 64, 64, 70, 81, 95]",7

The ever blowing breeze
The ever shining stars
Over the ever growing trees
Those drifting clouds above us (clouds above us)
Never will outlive
Our everlasting love (our everlasting love)

The ever whispering wind (the ever whispering wind)
The ever rolling sea (the ever rolling sea)
The shifting desert sand
Under the sun eternally
That endless sky high above (sky high above)
Never will outlive
Our everlasting love (our everlasting love)

My life was so wrong
Till you came along
And then with one kiss
You changed all the sadness
To joy and pleasure

So let the hands of time (so let the hands of time)
Keep ticking as they do (keep ticking as they do)
They'll only find that I'm
That I'm still side by side with you

Our everlasting love (our everlasting love)

563,Mexican Drummer Man,"[Left Channel]
Make sure!
Takin' cover in the bunker tonight
Waitin' for Bo Diddley's headlights

If music could talk

I feel alright
Gotta Fender Stratosphere
I can do anything tonight
It's in neon lights an' global rights
Frank? He's on the phone

There ain't no German girl outside
But who cares when its warm inside?
With music
Special mystery of music tragically
Exchanging slaves for majesties
Modern waves of tragedy
Packing a two pence colt pair of shoots
A shiny grey mexican suit
The blue eyed traffic can sashay by
'Cos tonight the sailor boys have hit Shanghai
The kick-out traffic goes creaking by
I smash my glass and shout shanghi
My drummer friend comes shooting by
He said Errol Flynn will never die
Oh no! Who am I to question why?

And are you lonesome tonight
And do ya need a country cowboy
Who's just thin and tight in those
Brrrr bus depot jeans
With a squirt resistant stud stud

Hey stoner
Get over there in the spliffbunker one
Because London Bridge was sold somehow
But it was too old anyhow
When Uncle Sam has broken down
We'll make him down in old Japan
Say yeah

Well there ain't no better band
Than Joe Ely and his Texas Men
Where the wind blows
I ain't seen none like that scenery
You can see from a bus if you pay the price

Wave my arms around
Flag one of those taxi's maybe
I saw a girl somewhere somehow
Forever sticks in my mind somehow
I've just got three lines
And a pair of two's
Like a lucky roll of dice that you
You cast

[Right Channel]
If music could talk!
Which means
Whatever your mind can bring
Like the apple fell off the tree
Pah! Fell right on his head
Yeah many years ago

There was a man who said
I am a shaman
A voodoo shaman
Got in trouble so he's going out
Mixing up and Haiti! Oh!
And the crickets
Buddy Holly said it was
Brrr Brrr yiii!

If music could talk you know

I feel kinda lonely
Standing out on the floor
Of Electric Ladyland...
Cos this is a good question Samson
Are you partly Arabic?

Chi man! Whatcho all about

I don't want to I can't hope to
Say it all in one go
Occasionally once or twice
A day I feel alive enough to say
Let's hear what the drummerman's
Got to say about
He said is it Errol Flynn's birthday or not?
Sept 12 until October
If they pack 2 piece
Colt pair of shoots
We got the shiny grey Mexican suits

I'm just wasting a great big
Corporation and the entire fund
The girders of Wall Street
And the temples of money
And the high priests
Of the expense account
And I'm wasting the whole thing

They make the best pianos

Tomorrow is a guess
But yesterday
Oh what I'd give for yesterday
To relive one yesterday
And its happiness

When Joanna loved me
Every town was Paris
Every day was Sunday
Every month was May

When Joanna loved me
Every sound was music
Music made of laughter
Laughter that was bright and gay
But when Joanna left me
May became December

I remember
Her touch
Her smile

She loves me

But your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

Over, over. Don't break down yet, it's over
Over, over. Don't break down yet, it's over
Over, over

Krazie:
Steady breakin' me on down
Mariah:
Oooh
Krazie:
Break, breakdown. Steady breakin' me on down
Break, breakdown. Steady breakin' me on down

Mariah:
You called yesterday to basically say that you care for me, but that you're
Just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be feeling similarly, and led you to believe I was
O.K. to just walk away from the one thing that's unyeilding and sacred to me

Mariah:
Well, I guess I'm trying to be, nonchalant about it, and I'm going to extremes
To prove I'm fine without you, but in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile. Gradually, I'm dying inside. Friends ask me
How I feel, and I lie convincingly, 'cause I don't want to reveal the fact that
I'm suffering, so I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night, and turn down all
The lights, and then I break down and cry

Mariah:
So what do you do when somebody you're so devoted to suddenly just stops loving
You? And it seems they haven't got a clue of the pain that rejection is putting
You through. Do you cling to your pride and sing ""I will survive?"" [Krayzie:
Gotta get control and roll, roll, roll on.] Do you lash out and say, ""How dare
You leave this way?"" Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away?

Mariah:
Well, I guess I'm trying to be, nonchalant [Krazie: Break, breakdown. Steady
Breakin' me on down.] about it, and I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine
Without you, but in reality I'm slowly losing my mind underneath the disguise of a
Smile. Gradually, I'm dying inside. Friends ask me how I feel, and I lie
Convincingly, 'cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering, so I
Wear my disguise 'til I go home at night, and turn down all the lights, and
Then I break down and cry

Wish:
Gonna break ya down, down, down, only if ya let it [Don't let it.]. Everyday
Crazy situations rockin' my mind tryin' to break me down, but I won't let it
Forget it. If ya feel the same way that I do, then let me help y'all, all
Singin' tunes, sayin' ""It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, yeah.""
Hopin' for the sun, but it looks like rain, P.O.D'ed, but it's still the same
Came far, but it's been a long road. Trouble's gonna come but we gotta stay
Strong. Hold on

Krayzie:
Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all, but nevertheless Krayzie won't
Fall. It's over. It's endin' here [here]. I said it's over. It's endin' here
[here], so I'll be on my way, and maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailin', bailin'. Bailin', baby, gotta get up, can't take no
More. I'm headed for the door, come and take a look into a thug humble eye
Tell me: if we lived a lie, would our souls unite?

Layzie:
Every new day is a test for me, so I just pray the Lord for Him to bless me
Please. There's struggles I'm goin' through lately, breaks me down, set me
Free. Let me be. Let me be. Who else do I have to rely on? Whose shoulder can a
Thug go cry on? Can I get my vibe on? While you look into my eyes, you won't
Underestimate, and this soldier story, I'm'a tell you right now I'm fed up
Wrong if I let my lead bust? Pac said keep your head up. Don't let this world
Get the best of you, I'm a stress you through it, if it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over

To the place where time stood still

From a heart where love is burning
How can men hope to hide
Blinded by their pride

A day is like a thousand years, and a
Thousand like a day
You're questioning the reason and you're
Hoping for delay
But it always comes out right
And it's coming like a thief at night
Steal away

Look on high, to the hill
To the place where time stood still
Then you'll see there's no returning
From a heart where love is burning
How can men hope to hide
Blinded by their pride

On the dark horizon rose the light of a different day
Spreading over all the world to show the living way
And it makes it all so clear
If you open up your ears and hear, now I say

Look on high, to the hill
To the place where time stood still
Then you'll see there's no returning
From a heart where love is burning
How can men hope to hide
Blinded by their pride",AD,1964,"[91, 77, 77, 88, 91]",5

These lives that we've led, they are a pale reflection

For listening to his same old lies

He's only playing a game
He's never loved you
He never will

There's a place
Somewhere that's between dream and awake
That's where we'll find each other
And I know that that sounds stupid, but it'll give us both something to find

When we were kids

And we'd laugh ourselves home

Even if I know that I may never win

That I know that you aren't ready
But you don't get to pick the day
That the worst one in your life will land right on
I can hear you beg for more
I can hold you in this song

Threw it away, but now I say
It's time to hand it over

We both knew it was true

And the rest hope for a shoulder

If we lose our touch, it won't mean much
If everyone's confused
Which door do we open?

You can't let the boy overpower the man in you

[Verse 2]
Oh, let me tell you that
Every man, has to understand
That you can go out with the fellas
But if the boy in ya tells ya, stay late
Yeah, late at night
You know that if you stop to think about it
The man in you is gonna say when
'Cause it isn't right

[Chorus]
Oh, you'd be surprised by the things
That a man who loves his woman, won't do
Oh, but you will
'Cause when it comes to the way
You treat your woman
You can't let the boy overpower the man in you

[Verse 3]
Just one more thing now that
All guys gotta realize
That they are many pretty women
But if a boy ever looks their way, yeah
And winks an eye
You know that if you stop to think about it
The man in you is gonna feel bad
Come on and pass them by

[Chorus]
Oh, you'd be surprised by the girls
Who walk on over at you too
Oh, but you will
But when it comes to the way
That you treat your woman
You can't let the boy overpower the man in you
You know, you know, you know you can't
No no, the man in you",Smokey Robinson and the Miracles,1964,"[59, 63, 66, 70, 72]",5
600,Love With The Proper Stranger,"[Verse]
I could fall in love with the proper stranger
If i heard the bells and the banjos ring
If two certain eyes with the look of danger
Smiled a welcome warm as spring
If the tom-tom in my heart sounded out a warning
""Don't let her, don't let her walk through the door""
""This is the one you've been waiting for""
Oh, yes, i'd know
However wild it seems, you know i'd know
And i'd whisper
""Come take my hand, proper stranger""
""Don't go through life as a stranger""
""For i'm a poor proper stranger, too""",Ray Charles,1964,"[62, 65, 65, 67, 63, 68, 74, 87]",8
601,To Each His Own,"[Intro: Pete Rock]
Yeah, uhh uhh InI is in the place
Yeahyeah uuh
Along with my man Extra P and my man Q-T
Here in the place to be
With the capital P, Rock on

[Verse 1: Grap Luva]
Vibrations from my voice bring life to microphones
If I make wrong moves then I'm headed for the dead zone
You heads flown and it's a crazy mess
You should've fessed when it came time to test the best
So next up is the one, the non-half stepper
The keeper of the door, healer of the lepers
Controller of the greed seed, with no ego to feed
Cause I stays level headed, vocabulary
Embedded up in the dome
I'm bound to crush Rome and let my spirit roam free
See it's the G bring it to you in the physical
Comin' through with the crucial raw material
I entertain each time I'm in the session
Leavin' brothers guessin', yo, what's that sound?
Got 'em wishin' they was on this pitcher's mound throwin' down
InI vibrations over plump tracks
Most of y'all clown cats couldn't match that
Touch this, I don't think you should attempt to
Cause if you do, of course I got to exempt you
From gettin any clout
No doubt, to each his own

[Hook]
To each his own (repeat 8 times)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Check it out to each his own, watch out cat
Niggas fake jacks to get a dollar bill
The choices made, they choose to ill
In Sodom and Gomorrah, survival is a horror
Scrams, let's make a move, you tryin' to be top scorer
And he really don't give a rat's ass who he go through
He's a big boy, he bites all he can chew
But yo, I eat on plates with hip-hop written on it
Pete Rock, the group InI shittin' on it
Lyrically impressive, ain't no second guesses
The most poppin' shit talker is the one who stresses
And you see the Abstract with a tight lipped carry
Speakin' on my peace and my soul is never varied
To my microphone I dialogue
It answers back with a whole lot a love, complemented with claps
I'm on some Grown Man shit, my peak is not yet reached
So, I remind my own and think of each
To each his own

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rob-O]
Excuse me, I'm here to earn a mere a buck or two
Now, take a chance with life or loser fuckin' you
All your friends, you're fly but why pretend?
You used to be shy but now you want be my skins
On the D-L, this is gonna swell for a second
But if I'm catchin' wreck
How many others is she steppin' in the sack with?
Guess I better get a prophylactic
Back to the crib in case I smack it
Bad tactic 'cause a jim hat caught a flat
Plus the boots, they wasn't even all of that
Now it's hectic, I'm jettin' to the joint to get injected
Bust it, the fact that I'm infected, so, check it out, yo
When you with these chicks and they spread out
With skins enough to take ya head out
Use precaution 'cause hookers packin' death behind a zit
Peace to the Gods and watch your dick
To each his own

[Verse 4: Large Professor]
To each his own, niggas is sown by the full-blown
Brother who could never be a clone
Large Pro, so fuck your bullshit hard show
I'm reppin' with the weapon, my whole squad glow
Like a diamond, so don't sham, fam, I have to climb in
That ass like a truck, leavin' niggas just struck
Like a lightnin' bolt, the cash flow goes right in the vault
In the end, peace to len times ten
Cee-Lo, the whole InI is my people
So, sit back relax and just listen while we pull
The moneys and honeys, fake frauds get thrown
To each his own, to each his own

602,A Letter To The Beatles,"[Intro]
My girl fell in love with a singing group
From England far away
She lost her mind, she lost her heart
When they began to play
""I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand""

[Verse 1]
And so my girl wrote a letter to The Beatles
Saying, ""You're so fine
You can have my love to keep
Take this heart of mine"" (Well)
""Beatles, I'd give you anything
All of my true love""
But they wrote a letter back to her
Sayin' that ain't enough

[Chorus]
You gotta send us twenty-five cents
For an autographed picture
One dollar bill for a fan club card
And if you send in right away
You get a lock of hair from our St. Bernard (Oh, no)
I want to hold your hand

[Verse 2]
So she wrote another letter to The Beatles
Saying ""You misunderstood
It's you I love, it's you I want
To have and hold for good"" (Well)
""Beatles I'd give you anything
All of my true love""
But they wrote a letter back to her
Sayin' that ain't enough

[Chorus]
You gotta send us twenty-five cents
For an autographed picture
One dollar bill for a fan club card
And if you send in right away
You get a lock of hair from our St. Bernard (Oh, no)
I want to hold your hand

[Verse 3]
So she wrote a last letter to The Beatles
And now my song can end
Others all around her makin' her life another heaven
Now my girl and The Beatles got together
And now she's my girl no more
But she wrote, ""Dear Beatles
I love you very much"" and furthermore

[Chorus]
She sent them twenty-five cents
For an autographed picture
One dollar bill for a fan club card
And 'cause she sent it right away
She got a lock of hair from their St. Bernard
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no",The Four Preps,1964,"[85, 86, 87]",3
603,I Can't Wait Until I See My Baby,"Can't wait until
I see my, my baby's face
When I tell him that I'm through
Oh, I'm through with him
Now he's been running around
I got to put him down
I can't wait to see the look
The look in his eyes
I wonder if he'll cry
When I tell him it's goodbye
Or will he try to change my mind
And make me stay
Or will he turn around
And with a smile on his face
Just walk away (walk away)
Walk away (walk away)
I can't wait until
I see my, my baby's face
Gotta find out what I feel
Oh, what I mean to him
Now, just one tear is all
He's got to shed for me
And I know that I will run
Yes, I will
I'll run to him
And hold him tight
And never, never let him go
And I can't wait until
I see my, my baby's face
I can't wait until
I see my, my baby's face
My, my, my
I can't wait until
I see my, my baby's face",Baby Washington,1964,"[93, 95, 98]",3
604,How Blue Can You Get,"Been downhearted baby
Ever since the day we met
I've been downhearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothin' but the blues
Baby how blue can you get
My love is like a fire
Your love is like a cigarette
My love is like a fire
But baby yours is like a cigarette
I watch you step down on it baby and crush it
Tell me how, tell me how, how blue can you get
You're evil when I'm with you
And you're jealous when we're apart
Yes you're evil when I'm with you baby
Lord have mercy, you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get
Hey that's a writing in my heart
I gave you a brand new Ford
And you just said I want a Cadillac
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
You said Thanks for the snack
I let you live in my penthouse
You said it was just a shack
I gave you seven children
And now you wanna give 'em back
I've been downhearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothin' but the blues
Baby how blue can you get",Cyndi Lauper,1964,"[97, 97]",2
