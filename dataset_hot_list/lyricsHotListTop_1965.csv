From the way you smile
To the way you look
You capture me
Unlike no other
From the first hello
Yeah, that’s all it took
And suddenly
We had each other

And I won’t leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

So don’t ever think I need more
I’ve got the one to live for
No one else will do
And I’m telling you
Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won’t get broken
We’ll never forget this moment
It will stay brand new
‘Cause I’ll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again

From the heat of night
To the break of day
I’ll keep you safe
And hold you forever
And the sparks will fly
They will never fade

It will stay brand new
‘Cause I’ll love you
Over and over again

Girl when I’m with you
I lose track of time
When I’m without you
You’re stuck on my mind
I’ll be all you need
Until the day that I die
I’ll love you
Over and over again

[Bridge]
So don’t ever think I need more
I’ve got the one to live for
No one else will do, yeah
I’m telling you

4,The Sound Of Silence,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might teach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence""",James Blake,1965,"[5, 16, 26, 34, 65, 80]",6

7,England Swings,"England swings like a pendulum do
Bobbies on bicycles, two by two
Westminster Abbey, the Tower, and Big Ben
The rosy red cheeks of the little children

Now, if you huff and puff and you fina'lly save enough
Money up to take your family on a trip across the sea
Take a tip before you take your trip; let me tell you where to go
Go to Engeland, Oh;

England swings like a pendulum do
Bobbies on bicycles, two by two
Westminster Abbey the tower of Big Ben
The rosy red cheeks of the little children

Mama's old pajamas and your papa's mustache
Falling out the window sill, frolic in the grass
Tryin' to mock the way they talk fun but all in vain
Gaping at the dapper men with derby hats and canes

England swings like a pendulum do
Bobbies on Bicycles, two by two
Westminster Abbey the tower of Big Ben

8,Ebb Tide,"[Verse]
First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

So, I'll rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel you are love
You are really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun

Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web of your arms

9,I Can Never Go Home Anymore,"I'm gonna hide if she don't leave me alone
I'm gonna run away
Don't!!
Cause you can never go home anymore

Listen, does this sound familiar?
You wake up every morning
Go to  school every day
Spend your nights on the corner
Just passing the time away

Your life is so lonely
Like a child without a toy
Then a miracle-a boy
And that's called ""glad.""

Now my mom is a good mom
And she loves me with all her heart
But she said I was too young to be in love
And the boy and I would have to part

And no matter how I ranted and raved
I screamed
I pleaded
I cried
She told me it was not really love
But only my girlish pride
And that's called ""bad.""

(Never go home anymore)

Now if that's happened to you
Don't let this
I packed my clothes and left home that night
Though she begged me to stay
I was sure I was right
And you know something funny?
I forgot that boy right away
Instead, I remember being tucked in bed
And hearing my mama say

(Hush, little baby, don't you cry)
(Mama won't go away)
Mama!!!
(You can never go home anymore)
Mama!!!
I can never go home anymore

Do you ever get that feeling and want to kiss and hug her?
Do it now
Tell her you love her
Don't do to your mom what I did to mine

She grew so lonely
In the end, angels picked her for a friend
(Never)
And I can never go home (never) anymore
And that's called ""sad""",The Shangri-Las,1965,"[10, 6, 6, 9, 12, 31, 51, 88]",8

We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright

We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend

Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason I’m a-traveling on
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 2]
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 3]
So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can’t hear you anymore
I’m a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 4]
So long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don’t mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time

12,Flowers On The Wall,"[Verse 1]

Last night I got dressed up, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down

You can always find me here and havin' quite a time

Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do

[Verse 3]
It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So, I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Break your heart
Tear it out tonite

My rage is uncontrolled
A danger to myself and others

Hate welling up inside
My heart feels black and numb
Your dreams are shattered right with mine and

I can't explain my own ways
And I can't explain all the pain

Can you make me feel again
Can you make me bleed again, emotions in me

And just live again, out of the cold, make me whole again

Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me ""The Enemy Watcher""
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
All your bars subpar like good golfers
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (Pew)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, ""Motherfuck school,"" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, ""What the heck was that?""
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, but you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image, I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic
Newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So, Lord, forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will

And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)

For a feeling that's so new
So inviting, so exciting

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly (I hear a symphony)
Ooh, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
Till I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Play sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, now, baby, baby, baby
You bring much joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on, now, baby, baby, baby
Those tears that fill my eyes
I cry not for myself
But for those who've never felt the joy we felt (baby)

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love now, baby, baby
As you stand holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now, baby, baby
Don't let this moment end

Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's fine, so fine
Other guys who meet her may not think she's much to see
I can't begin to tell you what she always does to me

Or the way she combs her hair

24,I'm A Man,"[Produced by Kevin Parker]

[Verse 1]
Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fucking doubt I make, unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to (uh)",Tame Impala,1965,"[25, 25, 17, 22, 27, 32, 45, 62, 83]",9

The other day seen this girl walk by the other way
I would have spoke but when I looked at her she looked the other way
Had it been another day I would have grabbed her by the hand
You don’t know who I am but see I love the way you smile
Do you got a man I’d be honored if I can walk with you for a second
That's if you ain’t got no plans
I’m trying to get to know you cause you’re the type I go to
The type I write a song and make a beat about and flow to
Anything to show you how beautiful you are
Wish I could hold you at night and every morning say hello to you
But you don’t know it yet
Maybe I’ll approach you next time and let you know exactly how I feel about you
Until then I think of how fly it would be if it were her and I
The apple of my urban eye
And next time no lie I guess I’ll try cause I

[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye

If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
It was one week later when I peeped her at the bus stop
Laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
Caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
Knowing I should go and talk to her fuck it why not
I walked over but I still couldn’t do it
It was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
See fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
And I’m never out of dodge when cupid aims with his pistol
They leave wounds and they scab and they pus
Just when I was thinking that I look up and seen the bus
Come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
That’s when I could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
I put my eighty-five cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
And I was extra sure until somebody sat first
Damn I guess my story got to wait until next verse

If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
It was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of July
But she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
So this my opportunity to try and get at her
""Is it cool if I sit?"" and then a smile was her reply
I sat down and started talking to her
Be careful of what I say cause I ain’t want to sound awkward to her
Said I been peeping you but I ain’t never spoke
And I figured if I try I probably choke
Then she laughed and looked at me acting like I told a joke
And said ""Joke for what? Lighten up, real talk I been trying""
And plus I always see you with him and she laughed again
But what she said next took me for a spin

[Bridge: Erika Flowers]
I saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
Waiting for a shooting star every night of everyday
To wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
Forbidden juices had me so weak

[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]

32,No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In),"[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
Came up, nigga, no elevators
Elevatin' haters with a pen and paper
Need to save up for some respirators
Cause these niggas hearts is filled up with hatin'
I'm the latest, but they run from Satan
Fuckin' slaves to paper but they never wake up
Demon faces powdered up with makeup
Only want the cake and I'm supposed to take her
Represent for the new age message, tryna give my generation some leverage
Been a member of the dark
Remember the fall of my soul? That's my November
Raise up into the light, it's only right that I lead the fight
I'm the sun up after the night, given insight to resurrect lives
Elixir sips, my nigga, take a hit
Your soul paper thin, my soul extra thick
I'm on my ancient shit, you can't pay for this
No genie in a bottle, but I get my wish, uh
Started from the bottom with no pot to piss
Now my generation love me and my conscious shit
Bull doze your prius, no stoppin' this
Weak niggas call it cocky, but it's confidence

[Verse 2: AK The Savior]
'Til the day I rest, I'm a beast like the Loch Ness
The best lowkey, that's me, young prophet
Spit bomb flows, torpedo drop
If your needle drop, better say I'm hot
How many motherfuckers wanna be at the top?
No effort, no triggers, nigga simple as that
Been through a lot so I fill a clip 'til stop
Tilt to the spot 'cause I been inhaling the pot
Silly motherfuckers think they runnin' shit
King-of-New-York talk, you're all soft pawns because your stomach's split
In the heap of battle, won't matter what sold platinum
Only thing that matters, your knowledge of war tactics
This is the Gaza, real dread locked roster
Execute a nigga talking shit in mi casa
Could of lost my life to the villainous monster
But my spirit just conquers everything I encounter
Motherfucker, hood is blown now each day
Now they burned out cause I earn from each race
Could of turned out on a jail route easy
But I stepped out the shade like a blunt, watch me blaze
UA the great, get your sin washed away
Tip top of shape, give me zip locks of dank
If you don't bake, nigga, pour up a drink
Live and have fun, nigga, come to your dreams

[Verse 3: Issa Gold]
Roll up a proper spliff, it's sittin' hot as shit
Dedicating every blunt to my prominence
Remain anonymous, unless it's commas to get
I was in a bottomless pit and now we float in the mist
Make the mist turn into monsoons
Pay the price and now we all colossal
Paint Picasso with a pencil, hostile
OG smoke engulfed in my nostrils
Make a toast, so what? We boast
We living lives, it don't take to know
We designed our hope, bet inside it sold
That's a rob in the coast like we riddin' a boat
Flatbush burnin' backwoods, attack coup
Bring a platoon to blast through you and your mans too
Bring it back up we masters better act cool
Turn the assholes and clap you and you damn fools

[Verse 4: AK The Savior]
Escape to a place of peace when the the drills blow
Happiness and love be the key to the real goal
Master in a game of life with no cheat codes
Told her no teeth and see she went beast mode
Hit her over stones at night and find my deep soul
Hit the bong, and long be gone alifinito
Incognito, hitter better reload
Everything you learn let it burn in the weed smoke
Inner light shinning like a diamond, hard to stick around
Enter in the game perfect timin' here to take you out
Here to make my momma proud, Livid when I knock em down
Spirit here to claim the crown AK be the golden child
Course they gon hate when they see you doin' great
Better start with yourself if you want to see change
Wanna see fame but don't even know the game
Try to restrain but I can't be changed
I ain't got shit for a dumb grown nigga
I'm speaking to the kids that alone don't give up
Ahead of your Biz young Lord don't deliver by the stars
Every inch go hard you a winner
Don't get lost in the matrix, minimum wages
Forced to the dark and be a criminal daily
Mental scars will make a nigga go crazy
Trust your heart come join the Indigo Navy",The Underachievers,1965,"[33, 52, 78]",3

Satin pillows to cry on
You've got nothing else to rely on
You gave up the most precious thing in life
You turned from love to be a rich man's wife
The man you married is colder than all his gold
You're something he bought to keep from growing old

Now you've got satin pillows to cry on
Satin pillows tro cry on
You've got nothing else to rely on
And you've got fancy dresses and big cars
Diamonds that outshine the brightest stars
But diamonds can't replace the love we knew
They won't keep you warm like my arms used to

36,Princess In Rags,"There's a girl who lives down the track
In a little shack made of timber wood
And her clothes are all hand-me-downs
From the folks in town who treat her so good

Though she hasn't got a dime
I'm so proud that she's all mine
'cause to me she's a princess in rags

Now her dad, he's a worn-out man
Prayin' if he can make enough to eat
And her mom cleans for everyone
Till the day is done just to make ends meet

All her wealth is in her charms
And the sweetness of her arms
How I love my poor princess in rags

I know some day I'll find a way
To take her out of this old place
I'll work and slave, scrimp and save
To change her rags to silk and lace

Though it hurts and my body aches
From the pain it takes just to set things right
But for now I must be content
With each moment spent in her arms each night

She's the only girl for me
And some day it's gotta be
Just me and my princess in rags

She's the only girl for me

The ups and downs, themselves
Before I knew it, we grew tired
With meaningless emotional drains

Repeated seesaw game
Now, I'm so sick of this
Repeated seesaw game
We're getting sick and tired of each other

Were the petty arguments the start?
The moment I became heavier than you
Because there have never been parallels in the first place
Maybe it was my greed trying to match myself with you
If it was love, and if this is what love means
Is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
We're tired of each other, yet seem to be holding the same cards
Well, then

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get off of it
There's no turning back

Let's not measure who will get off first
Let’s not drag things out
Let's follow our hearts
Let's put an end to this
This repeated seesaw game
Let's end this now

People can be so crafty
We know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
But because we don't want to be the villains
In the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
We became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
Although this wasn't the kind of parallel that I wanted

At first, we showed off who was heavier
We bragged and smiled at each other
Now we're trying measure who's heavier
A competition between us
That became a flame, igniting quarrels
It’ll only end if someone gets off right here
Acting like we’re comforting each other
With words mixed with thorns
Can’t keep doing this, we need to make a decision

If we didn’t have feelings for each other
If we didn’t think of each other
Would we have dragged it out like this?
Now if you don’t have any more feelings
This seesaw is dangerous
Stop thinking about me

45,Ain't That Peculiar,"[Verse 1]
Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

[Verse 2]
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby 'till I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger  (stronger, stronger, stronger)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I cried so much just like a child that's lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears (tears, tears, tears)

Now ain't that peculiar baby?
Peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar, honey?
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes
Ain't it peculiar, darling?",Marvin Gaye,1965,"[46, 28, 16, 8, 8, 8, 10, 15, 19, 35, 58, 71]",12
46,Jealous Heart,"Oh, jealous heart
Oh jealous heart stop beating
Can't you see the damage you have done
You have driven him away forever
Jealous heart now I'm the lonely one

I was part of everything he planned for
And I know he loved me from the start
And now he hates the sight of all I stand for
All because of you, oh jealous heart

Now that he's gone
He's gone and found another
I know he loved me at the start
Through the years his memory will haunt me
And all because of you, oh jealous heart

And all because of you, oh jealous heart",Connie Francis,1965,"[47, 57, 65, 72, 81]",5
47,A Must To Avoid,"[Chorus]
She's a must to avoid
A complete impossibility
She's a must to avoid
Better take it from me

You'll think she's a prize at the start
But take my advice, play it smart
She's nothin' but trouble
Better cut out on the double
Before she gets into your heart

[Chorus]
When you stare into her pretty blue eyes
There's no way to see through her disguise
But don't try to love her 'cause you'll quickly discover
You're trapped in the web of her lies

[Chorus]
Her lips look inviting it's true
But lots of other guys have felt like you do
She'll build up your hopes and when you need her the most
That's when she'll say goodbye to you

But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers

I never did fit in too well with the folks you knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to do
And you turned away from the love I offered you

But a paper smile only lasts a while then it fades away

I stay inside and I pray up to Christ
Hopin' one day I don't end my life
Way too depressed to express how I feel
Only smoke weed, sometimes on pills
Shit's a nightmare, I don't know what's real
She came back around since I got that deal
I don't want friends, I want happiness
She did me dirty, it's fuck that bitch
I was so broke but now I'm rich
Still the same gang, still the same clique
Xanarchy shit, tell that ho, ""Make a wish""
Feel the touch when we kiss
My hands on her hips, fell in love with her lips
Make her swallow my kids

That I don't have no fucks to give? Bitch

Should I ring your doorbell or just walk away?

Hiding in the shadows

I see two silhouettes on the back of your window shade
Are you there with another girl when I am gone?
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made
If you're there with another girl, I can't go on

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So, if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, oh, I would surely die

Love requires faith, I've got a lot of faith, but
I hear the music coming out of your radio

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, oh, I would surely die

You would never leave me, hurt me or deceive me
I'm a fool to doubt you, worry so about you

How do you explain that you've been so low?
You'd steal just to keep your stomach full and your habits up

Overdosed, so fucking close
Sometimes it takes losing everything, the life I chose

Open the door just to see

Tell me how you want it I'm on it
I really mean it I'm just not recordin'
Give lil bro the choppa for all you oppas
Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta
You are an impostor, ain't got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly
I really hate niggas I'm a Nazi
Love wearin' all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I'm feelin' Godly
Hop out like Coke, I ain't gotta park it
Fuck is y'all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can't get 'em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won't stop callin'
IBGM be the clique, bitch, you see us scorin'
V.I.P in the plural, while yo section borin'
Got a bitch that set it off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah
You rollin' around wit yo nieces, bitch you T.T
Mind full of money, got a heart full of demons
Mobbin' like Italians, we really take yo fingas
Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne
Have you singin' like Alicia, fuck wit my family
They be like you little, but got damn she spazzin'
Do the whole crew, my bitches freak nasty

Lil Dej ain't bout it, bitch how you figure

So lifted, flyer than yo girl, baby gone and take my picture

And I ain't signin' to no label, bitch I'm independent

Buried in the past, so many moments I want back
Tomorrow doesn't hurt until yesterday

Don't fight it, don't fight it

Don't hide it, don't hide it
Memories stuck in my head
All the things I should have said
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it

I wanna know after all these lessons learned
If there's a road from these bridges the we burned
I need to know if you still want me
Want me to show how much I need you

And all my girlish tricks they used to work somehow they now seem to fail
Why couldn't time just slow up why do we have to grow up so soon
Gone are the days of my broomstick cowboy roping your imaginary steers
It sseem just like only yesterday you brushed away my first tears
Now you shy away from my touch as time change just that much so soon
Straddlin' fences deep around corners playin'
Bang bang shoot 'em up hidin' in the hay
Time is a thief and a bad ol' meaner stealing all our games away
I thought you'd always be my broomstick cowboy you'd always be my very own

Oh, if Mother Nature don't stop you
Father time will

The pace that you're setting
You know it's too fast
Tomorrow, you'll have no future
And there's nothing worth
Thinking of from your past

You're just breaking yourself
Robbing your own till
If Mother Nature don't stop you
Father Time sure will

Listen, you're heading
In the wrong direction

And affection

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'

Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet

I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week

So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both

Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery

And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head

That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread

Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers

Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right

74,Second Hand Rose,"Father has a business
Strictly second hand
Everything from toothpicks
To a baby-grand

Stuff in our apartment
Came from father's store
Even clothes I'm wearing
Someone wore before

It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used

I'm wearing second hand hats
Second hand clothes
That's why they call me
Second hand Rose

Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar

Second hand pearls
I'm wearing second hand curls
I never get a single thing that's new

Even Jake, the plumber, he's the man I adore
He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before

Everyone knows that I'm just
Second hand Rose
From Second Avenue
From Second Avenue

No",Barbra Streisand,1965,"[76, 82]",2
75,It Was A Very Good Year,"[Verse]
When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen
When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one
When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five
But now the days grow short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
And it poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year
It was a mess of good years",Ray Charles,1965,[77],1

I have told you, baby
Your mama has told her, too (she told you, too)

Oh, what you wanna do
Yeah, three times seven, baby, you know what you wanna do
Alright now, yeah
Three times seven, baby, you know what you wanna do
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon now!

No more potatoes, frost have killed 'em again
Blues ain't nothing but he got a woman on your mind

Well, blues ain't nothing but a good woman on your mind
On your mind, on your mind (yeah, I say)

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch
As tears go by

My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch
As tears go by

Doing things I used to do
They think are new
I sit and watch

78,The Men In My Little Girl's Life,"Refrain:
The men in my little girl's life;
The men in my little girl's life

Seems only yesterday, I heard my daughter say:
""Daddy! There's a boy outside - his name is Rod
He wants to play in our back yard
Can he Daddy? Can he Daddy? Please - Daddy.""

There wasn't so long ago
She came to me and she wanted to know:
""Daddy! There's a boy outside - his name is Lee
He wants to carry my books for me
Can he Daddy? Is it all right - Daddy?
He's got freckles, Dad.""

Refrain:

Then came pony tails and jeans
My little girl was in her teens:
""Papa! There's a boy outside - his name's Tom
He wants to take me to the prom. Ok Papa?
He's cute Papa! We'll be home early - Papa.""

Well, before I knew it, time had gone
My, how my little girl had grown: Then it was:
""Uh! Father! There's a boy outside - his name is Eddie
He wants to know if we can go steady?
Can we Father? Yes Father?
Oh! can we borrow the car Pop?""

Yes, it seems like only yesterday
I heard my lovely daughter say:
""Dad! There's a boy outside - his name is Jim
He asked me if I'd marry him?
I said yes, Dad! - Got something in your eye - Dad?
I love him Dad.""

Refrain:

A child, an adolescent, a young lady, a wife
Oh! and oh yes, Heh! Heh!
There's another man in my little girl's life
""Hi Dad! There's a boy outside - his name is Tim
I told him Grandpa was gonna baby sit with him
Thanks Dad. Bless you Dad. Goodnight Dad.""

Refrain:",Mike Douglas,1965,[80],1
79,Everybody Do The Sloopy,"[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Yes y'all and it don't stop
Imagine a world without no cops
Smoking weed in the streets with no harassment
Ain't nobody breaking up the bashment
Ain't nobody handing out like 50 lashes
Ain't no momma crying in a napkin
All because her son got blasted
For putting his hands up
And asking a pig
""Please don't shoot me""
Everybody do the right thing
Like Mookie
Shouts out to Luke, I feel jukey
I'm kicking my truth in the booth
So high like I'm sitting on a roof
Like Snoopy
Fuck the police they all
Stupid ass dookie ass drug dealer groupies
We don't need 'em
Like a corner store that doesn't sell loosies
Hella boosie man
It was all a dream like Juicy
Rolling through the town like sushi
In a two seat
Feeling groovy
Zooted off a doobie
Loving life like Desi love Lucy
See me kick the rap so kookie
Ah sookie sookie
Sipping on lapsang souchong
Loose leaf
Who he? Victor? Nah
Viktor Vaughn
DOOM be Viktor Vazquez
Hehe
Kool A.D. - calm collected ass kid
With the spectacles
Throwin' y'all compact disks in receptacles
Slipping on vittles that's delectable
Um
And listen to the art so collectible, rare
Like a flank steak
Used to have hair as fucking long as a bank statement
And I cut it off not just to make a statement
I just didn't want to wash it
Shout out to the Buena Vista projects
See me at a Godstomper show
In the mosh pit
Man I got bars kid I'm awesome
I still got it never lost it
Alabaster Samovars
Paper thin parsnip
Slices with the lemon and olive oil
Big face racking a wallet up
Fucking promise you boy
I feel like the half-black Action Bronson
The half-white Ghostface
Hoe cakes track runner backer still
Crack sales rivalling Advil
Swing the hammer
Four swords on the anvil
Sacer skateboards on the mantel
The decors of a jazz man
Canoeing through the fjords of a labrador
Hop the bull horns like a matador
Man is not a panavore
Meaning he could not live on bread alone
Ha!
Tried to quit rapping but it wouldn't leave my head alone
I'm a dog trying to get a bone paws
That's a double entendre
Nas with the metaphors and similes
At least I like to think so
Hella fools copy the style like Kinkos
Y'all washed up and played out like
JINCOs
Me I'm evergreen like two pinko one stinko
Your boy built for Cuban links bro
Y'all live fast and think slow
Me I'm vice versa that curse that
Throw you in a hearse Jack
Ain't nobody doing worse black
Dick bigger than a church hat
Throw me any beat I'ma merc that clean
Hella mean I'm a jerk man
Y'all style generic like Kirkland
Diplomat immunity just like birdman
Hit you with a left and a right
Plus a third hand
Y'all be working off slander
That's thirdhand
What's good with your man
And plus your man
I'm ashamed of my country like a German
Bars make you thizz-face like
Ew, germs man
Kill it like Saddam did, Kurds man
Serve sand salad sandwiches
Blander than the ballad
Was described by the slickster
Kool A.D. the self appointed God trickster
Rock the skinny jeans like a hipster
Your boy a fixture like Pfister huh
Ayo
Go on
I go in in the sun like a blister
Violent Femmes went to the school with your sister
Or the zoo with your sister and kissed a mister
Can I get a dollar man?
Fuck it its a classic man
Remember that?
Young A-lister
Bend the hat brim like a white boy
Asha brim 45 corner shop hype boy
Haha
Cop the Glock 9
That's a nice toy
Sticking to the side of the pan
Like fried rice, boy
Damn I'm a nice boy

First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night

Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

[Verse 1]
I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away

Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, I'mma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

[Verse 2]
I'm going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

[Chorus]
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again

If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)

But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)

But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")

And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?

Knowing you never will

Love, love, love has made a fool of me
Got me doing things, things that shouldn't be
Listening for the sound of your knock on my door
Knowing that sweet sound will be no more

Funny, how precious memories linger on
So long after you're gone
And oh, precious memories that only make me cry
But I keep holding on, oh, why do I?

All because love, love, love makes me do these things
Speak your name softly each night
While holding your picture tight
When you took my heart, you took my soul
And it's far beyond control

Funny how precious memories linger on
So long, after you've gone
Oh, precious memories that only make me cry
But I keep holding on, oh, why do I?

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

You don't have to care

When the lightnin' strikes again
And the lights go down

And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again

You draw the line
And you leave it all behind you
You lost your mind and then you lose control
By the time
That you feel the lightnin' strike you
You know you've been holding back
You've got to let it go",Dokken,1965,[93],1

Well baby, I ain't going to eat out my heart anymore
Ain't going to eat out my heart anymore[x2]

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight

[Verse 1]
I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true

[Chorus]
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight

[Verse 2]
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan

Out of sight because my heart is true

94,Black Nights,"[Verse 1]
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

Still through the haze I can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 2]
I've played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

I've walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird

For a rainy day?

Is my moon out tonight?
Should I wake up today?

Should we keep it alive
Or lock it all up inside?

To be happy again?

97,"Love Theme From ""The Sandpiper"" (The Shadow Of Your Smile)","One day we walked along the sand
One day in early spring
You held a piper in your hand
To mend its broken wing
Now I'll remember many a day
And many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song
The shadow of a smile

The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes
My love and see
All the lovely things
You are to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal
That looks down in my soul

And watch her as she grows in my garden

I'm going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in my garden

102,May The Bird Of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose,"One fine day as I was walking down the street
I spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket in his tin cup I did drop it
And I heard him say as I made my retreat

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

My laundry man is really on his toes
Found a hundred dollar bill among my clothes
When he called me I came running
Gave him back his dime for phoning
And I heard him saying as I turned to go

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

I was way behind one day to catch a train
The taxi driver said we'll make it just the same
A speed cop made it with us and as he wrote out the ticket
I stood by politely waitin' for my change

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose

Birds, high up in the trees
Serenade the clouds with their melodies

Now, I belong to you
From this day until forever
Just love me tenderly
And I'll give to you every part of me

Oh, don't ever make me cry
Through long, lonely nights without us
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally

Someday we shall return
To this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain
Hear the birds above singing once again

You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And, if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful

You'll hold me in your arms

Down into Los Angeles
With dirty hands and worn out knees

The chambermaid awoke surprised
Thought she'd seen the last of him
She shook her head, let him in

Hey baby, there's somethin' in your eyes
Tryin' to say to me
That I'm gonna be alright if I believe in you
It's all I want to do

It was me and my sidekick

We were caught up in a barroom fight
'Til an Indian shot out the lights

Sure as night will follow day

113,The Drinking Man's Diet,"Oh, I'm on the Drinking Man's Diet
It came from a book I was loaned
It's really terrific and quite scientific
And I'm half stoned
For breakfast some cornflakes and vodka
But cornflakes have carbohydrate;
So I don't eat those fattening cornflakes
I eat the vodka straight
Drink, drink, everyone drink;
It's not as bad as we used to think
With every Manhattan your stomach will flatten
So drink, drink, drink
The Air Force invented this diet
A fact which they hotly deny
Of course they deny it, 'cause this is the diet
That got the Air Force high
For lunch you can have three martinis
What better lunch is there than that?
But caution: do not eat the olives
'Cause olives make you fat
Drink, drink, everyone drink;
It's not as bad as we used to think
If pounds you would burn off, then turn on your Smirnoff
And drink, drink, drink
For dinner, a nice Scotch and soda
Now that oughtta help you to lose
No whipped cream, no butter, just lay in the gutter
And booze, booze, booze
Suppose you should meet a policeman
Who says you've been quenching your thirst;
You just tell him it's physical fitness
And health comes first!

Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact

But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back

Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
Shit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane cook
Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love

I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle

115,Let Me Be,"[Verse 1]
Baby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3]
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

[Bridge]
'Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone, regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

121,I Want To Meet Him,"I saw the sun rise for the the last time
I watched it leave the Earth and leave us all behind
All the poor children
Will never know
The strength of their innocence
How quickly it goes
God's special little creatures
Could they have saved us from your poorly plotted arrogance?
Now they inherit the land
The blackest of all plagues
No one will visit their graves
Not even dirt can be saved
Is it so foolish to think
That we don't all sink to the same place?
And to the travelers I ask
Will you show me hell?
Have you met the devil?
I want to meet him, too
I want to ask him about God
Why he's abandoned you
Why he's left me alone
With nothing left to love
Why he's taken the world from us
While he hides above
And travelers say:
Son
Are you so blind you cannot see?
What little from the world
Can you offer me?
What's even left to take?
What kind of argument can you make?
What are you really trying to save?
Because all I see is a world in decay
I wish the cold would break
But the winds keep coming
To draw back the light
The dead weep for the world tonight
And I see him now
As the sun sets for the last time
A reflection of my broken self
Burning the lake of fire
We all carry our demons
And we make this world our hell
This world is our hell

Like detention I'm here from a distance [?]
I got visions of testing her limits, imagine her sight

134,Misty,"[Verse 1]
Oh, Honeybear, Honeybear, Honeybear
Mascara, blood, ash and cum
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love
Honeybear, Honeybear, Honeybear
Fuck the world, damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way
But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I wanna watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked, getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden-variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in ""I-told-you-so"" voice:
""It’s just how we expected""

[Chorus 1]
Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

[Verse 2]
You're bent over the altar and the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising? Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome, boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

[Chorus 2]
But everything is fine
Don't give into despair
'Cause I love you, honeybear

137,Only Love (Can Save Me Now),"It's hard to keep a smile on your face
When you're in front of the firing squad
And your last chance to run is runnin' out
Perspective doesn't figure in
Once you've got the blindfold on
And your last cigarette is burning down
Well, maybe I can finally get some rest
Or maybe you could grant my last request 'cause
Only love can save me now
Only love can save me now
Every wish I sigh echoes off the sky saying
Only love can save me now
It's hard to keep your eye on the prize
When somewhere in the back of your mind
You know the other shoe is bound to fall
How ya supposed to keep your sense of humour
When the woods are full of rumours
That someone's got their finger on the bomb
Nothin' that I ever lost or gained
Ever really mattered anyway 'cause
Only love can save me now
Only love can save me now
Every wish I sigh echoes off the sky saying
Only love can save me now
Running here and running there
Bar the entrances with chairs
All the walls are ten feet high or more
All the windows locked up tight
All the stash hid out of sight
'cause the big bad wolf is at the door

Only love can save me now
Only love can save me now
Every prayer I cry echoes off the sky sayin
Only love can save me now",Kimmie Rhodes,1965,"[94, 97]",2
138,But You're Mine,"When people say you're not my kind
And that your clothes are out of line
And that your hair isn't combed all the time
You're not real pretty but you're mine

We have a great big old society
That won't make room for folks like you and me
But I got some real bad news for them my friend
They're on the outside looking in

We've got a great thing going
And its gonna keep on growing
And I hope that real soon they'll see the light
But until that time they'll have to blow their mind
Cos it ain't us that's gonna lose this fight

So when we're walking I don't care
When all those people stop and stare
If they'd look in your eyes they'd see
You're not real pretty but you belong to me

Hey hey hey now
Hey hey hey now
When you're lovin' me baby
And when I hold you baby [When I kiss you]
I know you love me baby [When I hold you]
You know I'll never leave you [When I touch you]
I know I'll always love you [Every day now]

139,I Knew You When,"[Verse 1]
Been somewhere like this before
To a place we don't make sense together anymore
And if you're saying this is the end
Honey, I knew, I knew, I knew you when...

The first night in our first place
We ate on the floor where summer twilight ricocheted
And it was easier back then
Honey, I knew, I knew, I knew you when

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been loving, loving you too long
To just sudden, suddenly move on from this

To just sudden, suddenly move on from this

Baby please, I know, I know
So take me please, I'll go, I'll go

And I'm asking but you just can't say
I thought that you had my back

You have been everywhere
Chasing away the day
Facing away, you made it okay to please go and never stay
But where did you go today?
Could've been anywhere
But I believe there's something here that you should take in

Baby please, I know, I know
So take me please, I'll go, I'll go

To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

You got a lot of nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend

The side that’s winning

[Verse 3]
You say I let you down
You know it’s not like that
If you’re so hurt
Why then don’t you show it?

[Verse 4]
You say you lost your faith
But that’s not where it’s at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

[Verse 5]
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You’re in with

[Verse 5]
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I’d make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What it don’t know to begin with

[Verse 6]
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say “How are you? Good luck!”
But you don’t mean it

[Verse 7]
When you know as well as me
You’d rather see me paralyzed
Why don’t you just come out once
And scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I’d rob them

And now I know you’re dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don’t you understand
It’s not my problem

I wish that for just one time

And just for that one moment
I could be you

Hypocrisy of your heredity

So choose your views
Most carefully

So try to make the most of
Each precious breath

Ah, don't wave banners
You don't believe parasite
You'll have to discover
Your own wrong and right
Just color your perspectives
Black and white

They'll label you weird
But that's all right
They'll thank you in the end
After they've seen the light

Product of our society
What will you grow up to respect?

Tell me what will you

Ah, the heroes of the past
Were all good guys
But the leaders of the next war
No one will memorize

Only the orphan child
Will sound the cries
Of a mistake that could
Never be rectified

'Cause you can stop it if you try

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
나쁜 거라 더 좋은 거야
속으론 알고 있잖아
이젠 멈춰지지 않는 거야 (You can’t stop)
좀 더 솔직해져봐

[Verse 2: RM]
Stop
이제 그만 보고 시험공부해
니 부모님과 부장님 날 미워해
봤던 영상 각종 사진 트위터
브이앱 본보야지
알아 좋은 걸 어떡해
그만해 뮤비는 나중에 해석하고
어차피 내 사진 니 방에도 많잖어
한 시간이 뭐야 일이년을 순삭해
이 노랜 내가 네게 주는 상
착해

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, V]
벌 받는 건 아니잖아
이리 와 난 너의 paradise
Can't close your eyes
Can't close your eyes
발버둥쳐봐도 더는 소용없을 걸
(날 거부하지 마)
그냥 눈을 감고 귀 기울여봐

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook]
피리소릴 따라와 이 노래를 따라와
조금 위험해도 나 참 달잖아
널 구하러 온 거야 널 망치러 온 거야
니가 날 부른 거야 봐 달잖아
피리소릴 따라와
I'm takin' over you
I'm takin' over you

[Verse 3: V, Suga]
이미 시작된 걸 알잖아
그 소릴 듣게 된 순간
어쩌면 그래 나는 조금 위험해
널 이끄는 피리 부는 사나이처럼
나는 너를 시험해
알면서도 이끌리는 선악과처럼

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
내 피리는 모든 걸 깨워
그 소린 널 애태워 더
이끌려 반응하는 너
끊임없이 숨을 불어내
난 너의 guilty pleasure
헤어나올 순 없어
Never

그래 내가 좀 위험해
나도 나를 감당 못해
걱정 마 나의 손은
너에게만 따뜻해 따뜻해

Hey tell everybody

I got a dollar and a quarter
Just rarin' to clown
But don't let nobody play me cheap
I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep, so

156,Say Something Funny,"[Intro: Iggy Azalea]
I can't say something funny, I don't know what to say!

[Verse 1: Ray Rich]
I just popped the bean, man
I got that OJ and that weed, time to take flight
Richy might be on that lean mixed with that sprite
They got me rolling, smoking, drinking, I just might die tonight
I just gave a cup to Becky, now thinking that she ready
Ever met C getting nakey, there go Keisha, there she sexy
Ménage à trois if the bitches let me, and I think they gon' let me
One just call me Papi seconds later it's bukkake
She move too A.K.A. first bitch let it spray
Drunk bitch, big tits, motorboats on the way
She say she wanna earn some stripes
Well we about to see if she about that life

[Chorus]
Rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in a week
I got a bad bitch with me and I think she a freak
We about to make a movie girl, get the camera ready
Man it's the fucking minute, I'm thinking that she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Red cup, double stuff, I think she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Taking molly to the dome, I think she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Get here home by the Cove, I think she ready

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Whatever
Okay okay okay
Now I think I'm ready, I rip tracks, spit confetti
She kill raps, lyrics deadly
16 sex, no R.Kelly
That's no diss, a man want Becky
If you tell me you want Becky, give me Brian
That's O'Brain, use your noodle - no spaghetti, ay
Iggy, I'm bossing for dollars, cups of Ciroc on the ice
Sewing these weaves for you hoes, tweet me just name your price
Up all night in a life like this, fans pass out when I kiss
If you hate then you are toast, Not breakfast, keep burning witch
Chain hang, diamonds swang, two red cups my Sprite is mixed
Powder white, face of an angel, where she get that ass thick?
Stop, drop, bottles pop, for-ever, sandlot
Other rappers underground, call them all fraggle rock

[Chorus]
Rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in a week
I got a bad bitch with me and I think she a freak
We about to make a movie girl, get the camera ready
Man it's the fucking minute, I'm thinking that she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Red cup, double stuff, I think she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Taking molly to the dome, I think she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Get here home by the Cove, I think she ready

[Verse 3: 1st Down]
There's a pretty big bar, I got no manners
Don't blame me, just blame my Daddy, for
For life fort, some may snort, some may bort
They on my caddies, I'm on that E, the roll is me
Me and yo beesh, we bang like rabbits
(And that Cat......Mr. Fantastic)
And that night, we shine so bright, make me feel like I'm on acid
Probably call, shit blue magic, purple brain, I fill my cup
Bitch you know, that my cup ready, it's gettin' dark, feel my shark
Act a fool and then I'm game
Take one shot, blunts to the head, all that Remy, got that leg
I feel my heart, I think I'm cray, her booty don't start, or Simon Says
I'm like Big (Girl don't stop with you doin')
You not with me then you losin' bitch I'm tryna sing with my movie

[Chorus]
Rolling, rolling, rolling, I ain't slept in a week
I got a bad bitch with me and I think she a freak
We about to make a movie girl, get the camera ready
Man it's the fucking minute, I'm thinking that she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Red cup, double stuff, I think she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Taking molly to the dome, I think she ready
I think she ready, I think she ready
Get here home by the Cove, I think she ready",FKi,1965,"[35, 22, 25, 30, 42, 50, 66, 82]",8

In the chapel in the moonlight
While we're strolling down the aisle
Where roses entwine

How I'd love to hear you whisper
In the chapel in the moonlight
That the lovelight in your eyes
Forever will shine

Till the roses turn to ashes
Till the organ turns to rust

Till the moonlight turns to dust

Just like I used to do
You said hello again

Sound just like the truth
And I believe in you
The tears of yesterday have gone away
Here in your arms I will stay
This time my happiness won't disappear

Well, here I go again
Looking with my eyes
Things look bad for me
Seeing with my heart
I just close my eyes
And I can see we're so in love
Oh, darling, darling, darling
Don't you ever go away from me
This time you've got to promise
You're gonna stay with me
This time my happiness won't disappear

Things look bad for me
Seeing with my heart
I just close my eyes
And I can see we're so in love

162,Forgive Me,"[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Intro]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 1]
When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
See, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 2]
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 3]
Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again",50 Cent,1965,"[65, 61, 63, 73, 85, 95]",6

164,The Letter,"[Verse 1]
I can hear your laugh, it's ringing through the hallways
I can see your smile, it's what gets me through my hard days
And your words were supposed to get me
Through my heartache, before my heartbreak
There's an emptiness that only few ever feel
And I somehow missed the meaning of love that is real
And it compliments my scars that will never heal

[Chorus]
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage

[Verse 2]
And if you weren't gonna guide me
Why bring me into the light?
Must have done something
To make you want to run and hide
Why oh why didn't you just live your life?
And every girl needs a mother
And damn it I needed you
Instead you duck for cover
And you ran from the truth
And like kids do, you waited around for proof

[Chorus]
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage

We all have breakfast and with a kiss they're on their way

Sippin on my second cup and watchin' tv
I felt a strange feeling come over me

My best friend sue and my sister jane
I wonder if they'll ever change and taste the life you laid here for me

How love has changed me

I swear that child reminds me so much of myself

10:00 the kid's in bed
With the covers pulled up around their head
A little time for you and I to put our troubles on the shelf

He looks at me with that look in his eyes
I've seen that look before and it's no surprise
That's all I needed to complete my day
Knowing that each night is gonna be this way

How you got there, so just blow your mind

Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!

Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Bimmer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to key my house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me

Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne

Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though

So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

Oh, baby, and it's got me thinking of you (It's crazy)

[Chorus]
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (You look so good to me)
I smell your scent across the room (So sexy, damn)
And I can't wait to get next to you (Do I look sexy to you?)

[Verse 2]
Whenever you speak (Haha)
Whenever you move (That's what I think about)
Whenever you breathe (That's just the way I feel)
Baby, let me touch you (I don't know) please

[Chorus]
Secretly (I need to tell you)
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (I got a thing with you)
I smell your scent across the room (Do you see me?)
And I can't wait to get next to you ('Cause I see you)
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (It's crazy)
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you

[Outro]
You smell so good
I just wanna kiss you
I wanna lay with you
I don't know how to tell you",Jennifer Lopez,1965,"[64, 65, 67, 69, 78, 93]",6
189,Remember When,"[Verse 1]
Remember when, when it was 1992
Two little kids stealing records, skipping school
We must have been like only ten
Taking life for granted till we learn it had an end
Remember when, and time is something they say
You never appreciate till you age
And to this day you never knew
I wanted to be just like you

[Chorus]
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now

[Verse 2]
Remember when, when it was 2002
You started slinging coke and got the dopest pair of shoes
But, yo, this house just ain't a home
Since our father hit the bottle and our mother hit the road
And time is something they say
You never understand until it slips away
And looking back I think you knew
I wanted to be just like you

[Chorus]
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now

[Post-Chorus]
And now I'm tired of the violence, I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you
Now I'm tired of the violence, I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you

[Bridge]
Slipping and we're falling
Slipping and we're falling through ice
Slipping and we're falling
Don't know where we're going with our lives

[Chorus]
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew, then what I know now
Then what I know now

[Post-Chorus]
And now I'm tired of the violence, I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you
Now I'm tired of the violence, I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you

[Outro]
Remember when
Slipping and we're falling
Slipping and we're falling through ice
Slipping and we're falling
Don't know where we're going with our lives
Slipping and we're falling
Slipping and we're falling through ice",BAD WOLVES,1965,"[69, 74, 78, 85]",4
190,A Lifetime Of Loneliness,"Since you left me
I'm finding out what heartbreak is so
Help me, save me
You are the judge and I'm your prisoner

Don't sentence me into a lifetime of loneliness
Without your love
I would die
Without your love
I wouldn't even try
To carry on

I was born to love you
Spare me a life of loneliness and tears

For I believe when love is true
One hasn't got the right
To turn to someone new
One hasn't got the right
To break somebody's heart
The way you've broken mine

Come back, I want you, need you
Bring back the love you shared with me
Without you, darlin'
I'm such a lonely human being

Don't sentence me into a lifetime of loneliness
Without your love
I would die
Without your love
I wouldn't every try
To carry on

I was born to love you
Come to my arms and rescue, rescue me",Jackie DeShannon,1965,"[71, 66, 66, 68, 76, 84]",6
191,Just Yesterday,"[Verse 1]
Don't say you want it, it's clear that you're haunted
There's a ghost in you, that you can't lose
You say you don't need it, you're clearly defeated
What's left to do, but break in two?

[Chorus]
It's not like it was just yesterday
Remember the days we chose to waste?
Still trying to fill your place
It's not like it was just yesterday

[Verse 2]
Feeling exhausted, I know, that you want this
I'm the ghost in you, that you can't lose
His stripping your armor, abandoning Father
He'll leave you soon, it's what we do

[Chorus]
It's not like it was just yesterday
Remember the days we chose to waste?
Still trying to fill your place
It's not like it was just yesterday

[Bridge]
Is it a waste of time, trying to make this right?
I've got no peace of mind, if you're not in my life
Should I let you go, and be with someone new?
Should I say, I'm happy for you?
And pretend, I'm happy for you?

[Chorus]
It's not like it was just yesterday
Remember the days we chose to waste?
Still trying to fill your place
It's not like it was just yesterday",This Wild Life,1965,"[73, 78, 87, 89, 90]",5
192,Inky Dinky Spider (The Spider Song),"CANTO 1

I was the shadow of the waxwing slain
By the false azure in the windowpane;
I was the smudge of ashen fluff--and I
Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky.
And from the inside, too, I'd duplicate
Myself, my lamp, an apple on a plate:
Uncurtaining the night, I'd let dark glass
Hang all the furniture above the grass,
And how delightful when a fall of snow
Covered my glimpse of lawn and reached up so
As to make chair and bed exactly stand
Upon that snow, out in that crystal land!

Retake the falling snow: each drifting flake
Shapeless and slow, unsteady and opaque,
A dull dark white against the day's pale white
And abstract larches in the neutral light.
And then the gradual and dual blue
As night unites the viewer and the view,
And in the morning, diamonds of frost
Express amazement: Whose spurred feet have crossed
From  left to right the blank page of the road?
Reading from left to right in winter's code:
A dot, an arrow pointing back; repeat:
Dot, arrow pointing back...A pheasant's feet!
Torquated beauty, sublimated grouse,
Finding your China right behind my house.
Was he in Sherlock Holmes, the fellow whose
Tracks pointed back when he reversed his shoes?

All colors made me happy: even gray.
My eyes were such that literally they
Took photographs. Whenever I'd permit,
Or, with a silent shiver, order it,
Whatever in my field of vision dwelt--
An indoor scene, hickory leaves, the svelte
Stilettos of a frozen stillicide--
Was printed on my eyelids' nether side
Where it would tarry for an hour or two,
And while this lasted all I had to do
Was close my eyes to reproduce the leaves,
Or indoor scene, or trophies of the eaves.

I cannot understand why from the lake
I could make out our front porch when I'd take
Lake Road to school, whilst now, although no tree
Has intervened, I look but fail to see
Even the roof. Maybe some quirk in space
Has caused a fold or furrow to displace
The fragile vista, the frame house between
Goldsworth and Wordsmith on its square of green.

I had a favorite young shagbark there
With ample dark jade leaves and a black, spare
Vermiculated trunk. The setting sun
Bronzed the black bark, around which, like undone
Garlands, the shadows of the foliage fell.
It is now stout and rough; it has done well.
White butterflies turn lavender as they
Pass through its shade where gently seems to sway
The phantom of my little daughter's swing.

The house itself is much the same. One wing
We've had revamped. There's a solarium. There's
A picture window flanked with fancy chairs.
TV's huge paperclip now shines instead
Of the stiff vane so often visited
By the naive, the gauzy mockingbird
Retelling all the programs that she had heard;
Switching from chippo-chippo to a clear
To-wee, to-wee; then rasping out: come here,
Come here, come herrr'; flitting her tail aloft,
Or gracefully indulging in a soft
Upward hop-flop, and instantly (to-wee)
Returning to her perch--the new TV.

I was an infant when my parents died.
They both were ornithologists. I've tried
So often to evoke them that today
I have a thousand parents. Sadly they
Dissolve in their own virtues and recede,
But certain words, chance words I hear or read,
Such as ""bad heart"" always to him refer,
And ""cancer of the pancreas"" to her.

A preterist: one who collects cold nests.
Here was my bedroom, now reserved for guests.
Here, tucked away by the Canadian maid,
I listened to the buzz downstairs and prayed
For everybody to be always well,
Uncles and aunts, the maid, her niece Adele,
Who'd seen the Pope, people in books, and God.

I was brought up by dear bizarre Aunt Maud,
A poet and a painter with a taste
For realistic objects interlaced
With grotesque growths and images of doom.
She lived to hear the next babe cry. Her room
We've kept intact. Its trivia create
A still life in her style: the paperweight
Of convex glass enclosing a lagoon,
The verse open at the Index (Moon,
Moonrise, Moor, Moral), the forlorn guitar
The human skull; and from the local Star
A curio: Red Sox Beat Yanks 5-4
On Chapman's Homer, thumbtacked to the door

My God they died young. Theolatry I found
Degrading, and its premises, unsound.
No free man needs a God; but was I free?
How fully I felt nature glued to me
And how my childish palate loved the taste
Half-fish, half-honey, of that golden paste

My picture book was at an early age
The painted parchment papering our cage:
Mauve rings around the moon; blood-orange sun;
Twinned Iris; and that rare phenomenon
The iridule--when beautiful and strange,
In a bright sky above a mountain range
One opal cloudlet in an oval form
Reflects the rainbow of a thunderstorm
Which in a distant valley has been staged--
For we are most artistically caged.

And there's the wall of sound: the nightly wall
Raised by a trillion crickets in the fall.
Impenetrable! Halfway up the hill
I'd pause in thrall of their delirious trill.
That's Dr. Sutton's light. That's the Great Bear.
A thousand years ago five minutes were
Equal to forty ounces of fine sand.
Outstare the stars. Infinite foretime and
Infinite aftertime: above your head
They close like giant wings, and you are dead.

The regular vulgarian, I daresay,
Is happier: He sees the Milky Way
Only when making water. Then as now
I walked at my own risk: whipped by the bough,
Tripped by the stump. Asthmatic, lame and fat,
I never bounced a ball or swung a bat.

I was the shadow of the waxwing slain
By feigned remoteness in the windowpane.
I had a brain, five senses (one unique),
But otherwise I was a cloutish freak.
In sleeping dreams I played with other chaps
But really envied nothing--save perhaps
The miracle of a lemniscate left
Upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft
Bicycle tires.

A thread of subtle pain,
Tugged at by playful death, released again,
But always present, ran through me. One day,
When I'd just turned eleven, as I lay
Prone on the floor and watched a clockwork toy--
A tin wheelbarrow and pushed by a tin boy--
Bypass chair legs and stray beneath the bed,
There was a sudden sunburst in my head.

And then black night. That blackness was sublime.
I felt distributed through space and time:
One foot upon a mountaintop, one hand
Under the pebbles of a panting strand,
One ear in Italy, one eye in Spain,
In caves, my blood, and the stars, my brain.
There were dull throbs in my Triassic; green
Optical spots in Upper Pleistocene,
An icy shiver down my Age of Stone,
And all tomorrows in my funny bone.

During one winter every afternoon
I'd into that momentary swoon.
And then it ceased. Its memory grew dim.
My health improved. I even learned to swim.
But like some little lad forced by a wench
With his pure tongue her abject thirst to quench,
I was corrupted, terrified, allured,
And though old Doctor Colt pronounced me cured
Of what, he said, were mainly growing pains,
The wonder lingers and the shame remains.

CANTO TWO

There was a time in my demented youth
When somehow I suspected that the truth
About survival after death was known
To every human being: I alone
Knew nothing, and a great conspiracy
Of books and people hid the truth from me.

There was the day when I began to doubt
Man's sanity: How could he live without
Knowing for sure what dawn, what death, what doom
Awaited consciousness beyond the tomb?

And finally there was the sleepless night
When I decided to explore and fight
The foul, the inadmissible abyss,
Devoting all my twisted life to this
One task. Today I'm sixty-one. Waxwings
Are berry-pecking. A cicada sings.

The little scissors I am holding are
A dazzling synthesis of sun and star.
I stand before the window and I pare
My fingernails and vaguely am aware
Of certain flinching likenesses: the thumb,
Our grocer's son; the index, lean and glum
College astronomer Starover Blue;
The middle fellow, a tall priest I knew;
The feminine fourth finger, an old flirt;
And little pinky clinging to her skirt.
And I make mouths as I snip off the thin
Strips of what Aunt Maud used to call ""scarf skin.""

Maud Shade was eighty when a sudden hush
Fell on her life. We saw the angry flush
And torsion of paralysis assail
Her noble cheek. We moved her to Pinedale,
Famed for its sanitarium. There she'd sit
In the glassed sun and watch the fly that lit
Upon her dress and then upon her wrist.
Her mind kept fading in the growing mist.
She still could speak. She paused, then groped,and found
What seemed at first a serviceable sound,
But from adjacent cells impostors took
The place of words she needed, and her look
Spelt imploration as she sought in vain
To reason with the monsters in her brain.

What moment in the gradual decay
Does resurrection choose? What year? What day?
Who has the stopwatch? Who rewinds the tape?
Are some less lucky, or do all escape?
A syllogism: other men die; but I
Am not another; therefore I'll not die.
Space is a swarming in the eyes; and time
A singing in the ears. In this hive I'm
Locked up. Yet, if prior to life we had
Been able to imagine life, what mad,
Impossible, unutterably weird
Wonderful nonsense it might have appeared!

So why join in the vulgar laughter? Why
Scorn a hereafter none can verify:
The Turk's delight, the future lyres, the talks
With Socrates and Proust in cypress walks,
The seraph with his six flamingo wings,
And Flemish hells with porcupines and things?
It isn't that we dream too wild a dream:
The trouble is we do not make it seem
Sufficiently unlikely; for the most
We can think up is a domestic ghost.

How ludicrous these efforts to translate
Into one's private tongue a public fate!
Instead of poetry divinely terse,
Disjointed notes, Insomnia's mean verse!

Life is a message scribbled in the dark.
Anonymous.
               Espied on a pine's bark,
As we were walking home the day she died,
An empty emerald case, squat and frog-eyed,
Hugging the trunk; and its companion piece,
A gum-logged ant.
               That Englishman in Nice,
A proud and happy linguist: je nourris
Les pauvres cigales--meaning that he
Fed the poor sea gulls!
                    Lafontaine was wrong;
Dead is the mandible, alive the song.

And so I pare my nails, and muse, and hear
Your steps upstairs, and all is right, my dear.

Sybil, throughout our high-school days I knew
Your loveliness, but fell in love with you
During an outing of the senior class
To New Wye Falls. We luncheoned on damp grass.
Our teacher of geology discussed
The cataract. Its roar and rainbow dust
Made the tame park romantic. I reclined
In April's haze immediately behind
Your slender back and watched your neat small head
Bend to one side. One palm with fingers spread,
Between a star of trillium and a stone,
Pressed on the turf. A little phalange bone
Kept twitching. Then you turned and offered me
A thimbleful of bright metallic tea.

Your profile has not changed. The glistening teeth
Biting the careful lip; the shade beneath
The eyes from the long lashes; the peach down
Rimming the cheekbone; the dark silky brown
Of hair brushed up from temple and from nape;
The very naked neck; the Persian shape
Of nose and eyebrow, you have kept it all--
And on still nights we hear the waterfall.

Come and be worshiped, come and be caressed,
My dark Vanessa, crimson-barred, my blest
My Admirable butterfly! Explain
How could you, in the gloam of Lilac Lane,
Have let uncouth, hysterical John Shade
Blubber your face, and ear, and shoulder blade?

We have been married forty years. At least
Four thousand times your pillow has been creased
By our two heads. Four hundred thousand times
The tall clock with the hoarse Westminster chimes
Has marked our common hour. How many more
Free calendars shall grace the kitchen door?

I love you when you're standing on the lawn
Peering at something in a tree: ""It's gone
It was so small. It might come back"" (all this
Voiced in a whisper softer than a kiss).
I love you when you call me to admire
A jet's pink trail above the sunset fire.
I love you when you're humming as you pack
A suitcase or the farcical car sack
With round-trip zipper. And I love you most
When with a pensive nod you greet her ghost
And hold her first toy on your palm, or look
At a postcard from her, found in a book.

She might have been you, me, or some quaint blend:
Nature chose me so as to wrench and rend
Your heart and mine. At first we'd smile and say:
""All little girls are plump"" or ""Jim McVey
(The family oculist) will cure that slight
Squint in no time."" And later: ""She'll be quite
Pretty, you know""; and trying to assuage
The swelling torment: ""That's the awkward age.""
""She should take riding lessons,"" you would say
(Your eyes and mine not meeting). ""She should play
Tennis, or badminton. Less starch, more fruit
She may not be a beauty, but she's cute.""

It was no use, no use. The prizes won
In French and history, no doubt, were fun;
At Christmas parties games were rough, no doubt,
And one shy little guest might be left out;
But let's be fair: while children of her age
Were cast as elves and fairies on the stage
That she'd helped paint for the school pantomime,
My gentle girl appeared as Mother Time,
A bent charwoman with a slop pail and broom,
And like a fool I sobbed in the men's room.

Another winter was scraped-scropped away.
The Toothwart White haunted our woods in May.
Summer was power-mowed, and autumn, burned.
Alas, the dingy cygnet never turned
Into a wood duck. And again your voice:
""But this is prejudice You should rejoice
That she is innocent. Why overstress
The physical? She wants to look a mess.
Virgins have written some resplendent books.
Lovemaking is not everything. Good looks,
Are not that indispensable!"" And still
Old Pan would call from every painted hill,
And still the demons of our pity spoke:
No lips would share the lipstick of her smoke;
The telephone that rang before a ball
Every two minutes in Sorosa Hall
For her would never ring; and, with a great
Screeching of tires on gravel, to the gate
Out of lacquered night, a white-scarfed beau
Would never come for her; she'd never go,
A dream of gauze and jasmine, to that dance.
We sent her, though, to a chateau in France.


And she returned in tears, with new defeats,
New miseries. On days when all the streets
Of College Town led to the game, she'd sit
On the library steps, and read or knit;
Mostly alone she'd be, or with that nice
Frail roommate, now a nun; and, once or twice,
With a Korean boy who took my course.
She had strange fears, strange fantasies, strange force
Of character--as when she spent three nights
Investigating certain sounds and lights
In an old barn. She twisted words: pot, top
Spider, redips. And""powder"" was ""red wop.""
She called you a didactic katydid.
She hardly ever smiled, and when she did,
It was a sign of pain. She'd criticize
Ferociously our projects, and with eyes
Expressionless sit on her tumbled bed
Spreading her swollen feet, scratching her head
With psoriatic fingernails, and moan,
Murmuring dreadful words in monotone.

She was my darling: difficult, morose--
But still my darling. You remember those
Almost unruffled evenings when we played
Mah-jongg, or she tried on your furs, which made
Her almost fetching; and the mirrors smiled,
The lights were merciful, the shadows mild.
Sometimes I'd help her with a Latin text,
Or she'd be reading in her bedroom, next
To my fluorescent lair, and you would be
In your own study, twice removed from me,
And I would hear both voices now and then:
""Mother, what's grimpen?"" ""What is what?""
""Grim pen.""
Pause, and your guarded scholium. Then again:
""Mother, what's chtonic?"" That, too, you'd explain,
Appending: ""Would you like a tangerine?""
""No. Yes. And what does sempiternal mean?""
You'd hesitate. And lustily I'd roar
The answer from my desk through the closed door.

It does not matter what it was she read
(some phony modern poem that was said
In English Lit to be a document
""Engazhay and compelling""--what this meant
Nobody cared); the point is that the three
Chambers, then bound by you and her and me,
Now form a tryptich or a three-act play
In which portrayed events forever stay.

I think she always nursed a small mad hope.

I'd finished recently my book on Pope.
Jane Dean, my typist, offered her one day
To meet Pete Dean, a cousin. Jane's fiance
Would then take all of them in his new car
A score of miles to a Hawaiian bar.
The boy was picked up at a quarter past
Eight in New Wye. Sleet glazed the roads. At last
They found the place--when suddenly Pete Dean
Clutching his brow exclaimed that he had clean
Forgotten an appointment with a chum
Who'd land in jail if he, Pete, did not come,
Et cetera. She said she understood.
After he'd gone the three young people stood
Before the azure entrance for awhile.
Puddles were neon-barred; and with a smile
She said she'd be de trop, she'd much prefer
Just going home. Her friends escorted her
To the bus stop and left; but she, instead
Of riding home, got off at Lochanhead.

You scrutinized your wrist: ""It's eight fifteen.
[And here time forked.] I'll turn it on."" The screen
In its blank broth evolved a lifelike blur,
And music welled.
[line break]
He took one look at her,
And shot a death ray at well-meaning Jane.

A male hand traced from Florida to Maine
The curving arrows of Aeolian wars.
You said that later a quartet of bores,
Two writers and two critics, would debate
The Cause of Poetry on Channel 8
A nymph came pirouetting, under white
Rotating petals, in a vernal rite
To kneel before an altar in a wood
Where various articles of toilet stood.
I went upstairs and read a galley proof,
And heard the wind roll marbles on the roof.
""See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing""
Has unmistakably the vulgar ring
Of its preposterous age. Then came your call,
My tender mockingbird, up from the hall.
I was in time to overhear brief fame
And have a cup of tea with you: my name
Was mentioned twice, as usual just behind
(one oozy footstep) Frost.
""Sure you don't mind?
I'll catch the Exton plane, because you know
If I don't come by midnight with the dough--""

And then there was a kind of travelog:
A host narrator took us through the fog
Of a March night, where headlights from afar
Approached and grew like a dilating star,
To the green, indigo, and tawny sea
Which we had visited in thirty-three,
Nine months before her birth. Now it was all
Pepper-and-salt, and hardly could recall
That first long ramble, the relentless light,
The flocks of sails (one blue among the white
Clashed queerly with the sea, and two were red),
The man in the old blazer, crumbing bread,
The crowding gulls insufferably loud,
And one dark pigeon waddling in the crowd.

""Was that the phone?"" You listened at the door.
Nothing. Picked up the program from the floor.
More headlights in the fog. There was no sense
In window-rubbing; only some white fence
And the reflector poles passed by unmasked.

""Are we quite sure she's acting right?"" you asked.
""It's technically a blind date, of course.
Well, shall we try the preview of Remorse?""
And we allowed, in all tranquility,
The famous film to spread its charmed marquee;
The famous face flowed in, fair and inane;
The parted lips, the swimming eyes, the grain
Of beauty on the cheek, odd gallicism,
And the soft form dissolving in the prism
Of corporate desire.
""I think,"" she said,
""I'll get off here."" ""It's only Lochanhead.""
""Yes, that's okay."" Gripping the stang, she peered
At ghostly trees. Bus stopped. Bus disappeared.

Thunder above the Jungle. ""No, not that!""
Pat Pink, our guest (antiatomic chat).
Eleven struck. You sighed. ""Well, I'm afraid
There's nothing else of interest."" You played
Network roulette: the dial turned and trk'ed.
Commercials were beheaded. Faces flicked.
An open mouth in midsong was struck out.
An imbecile with sideburns was about
To use his gun, but you were much too quick.
A jovial Negro raised his trumpet. Trk.
Your ruby ring made life and laid the law.
Oh, switch it off! And as life snapped we saw
A pinhead light dwindle and die in black
Infinity.

Out of his lakeside shack
A watchman, Father Time, all gray and bent,
Emerged with his uneasy dog and went
Along the reedy bank. He came too late.

You gently yawned and stacked away your plate.
We heard the wind. We heard it rush and throw
Twigs at the windowpane. Phone ringing? No.
I helped you with the dishes. The tall clock
Kept on demolishing young root, old rock.

""Midnight,"" you said. What's midnight to the young?
And suddenly a festive blaze was flung
Across five cedars, snowpatches showed,
And a patrol car on our bumpy road
Came to a crunching stop. Retake, retake!

People have thought she tried to cross the lake
At Lochan Neck where zesty skaters crossed
From Exe to Wye on days of special frost.
Others supposed she might have lost her way
By turning left from Bridgeroad; and some say
She took her poor young life. I know. You know.

It was a night of thaw, a night of blow,
With great excitement in the air. Black spring
Stood just around the corner, shivering
In the wet starlight and on the wet ground.
The lake lay in the mist, its ice half drowned.
A blurry shape stepped off the reedy bank
Into a crackling, gulping swamp, and sank.

CANTO THREE

L'if, lifeless tree! Your great Maybe, Rabelais:
The grand potato.
I.P.H., a lay
Institute (I) of Preparation (P)
For the Hereafter (H), or If, as we
Called it--big if!--engaged me for one term
To speak on death (""to lecture on the Worm,""
Wrote President McAber).
You and I,
And she, then a mere tot, moved from New Wye
To Yewshade, in another, higher state.
I love great mountains. From the iron gate
Of the ramshackle house we rented there
One saw a snowy form, so far, so fair,
That one could only fetch a sigh, as if
It might assist assimilation.
Iph
Was a larvorium and a violet:
A grave in Reason's early spring. And yet
It missed the gist of the whole thing; it missed
What mostly interests the preterist;
For we die every day; oblivion thrives
Not on dry thighbones but on blood-ripe lives,
And our best yesterdays are now foul piles
Of crumpled names, phone numbers and foxed files.
I'm ready to become a floweret.
Or a fat fly, but never, to forget.
And I'll turn down eternity unless
The melancholy and the tenderness
Of mortal life; the passion and the pain;
The claret taillight of that dwindling plane
Off Hesperus; your gesture of dismay
On running out of cigarettes; the way
You smile at dogs; the trail of silver slime
Snails leaves on flagstones; this good ink, this rhyme,
This index card, this slender rubber band
Which always forms, when dropped, an ampersand,
Are found in Heaven by the newlydead
Stored in its strongholds through the years.
Instead
The Institute assumed it might be wise
Not to expect too much of paradise:
What if there's nobody to say hullo
To the newcomer, no reception, no
Indoctrination? What if you are tossed
Into a boundless world, your bearings lost,
Your spirit stripped and utterly alone,
Your task unfinished, your despair unknown,
Your body just beginning to putresce,
A non-undressable in morning dress,
Your widow lying prone on a firm bed,
Herself a blur in your dissolving head!

While snubbing gods, including the big G,
Iph borrowed some peripheral debris
From mystic visions; and it offered tips
(The amber spectacles for life's eclipse)--
How not to panic when you're made a ghost:
Sidle and slide, choose a smooth surd, and coast,
Meet solid bodies and glissade right through,
Or let a person circulate through you.
How to locate in blackness, with a gasp,
Terra the Fair, an orbicle of jasp.
How to keep sane in spiral types of space.
Precautions to be taken in the case
Of freak reincarnation: what to do
On suddenly discovering that you
Are now a young and vulnerable toad
Plump in the middle of a busy road,
Or a bear cub beneath a burning pine,
Or a book mite in a revived divine.

Time means succession, and succession, change:
Hence timelessness is bound to disarrange
Schedules of sentiment. We give advice
To widower. He has been married twice:
He meets his wives; both loved, both loving, both
Jealous of one another. Time means growth,
And growth means nothing in Elysian life.
Fondling a changeless child, the flax-haired wife
Grieves on the brink of a remembered pond
Full of a dreamy sky. And, also blond,
But with a touch of tawny in the shade,
Feet up, knees clasped, on a stone balustrade
The other sits and raises a moist gaze
Toward the blue impenetrable haze.
How to begin? Which first to kiss? What toy
To give the babe? Does that small solemn boy
Know of the head-on crash which on a wild
March night killed both the mother and the child?
And she, the second love, with instep bare
In ballerina black, why does she wear
The earrings from the other's jewel case?
And why does she avert her fierce young face?

For as we know from dreams it is so hard
To speak to our dear dead! They disregard
Our apprehension, queaziness and shame--
The awful sense that they're not quite the same.
And our school chum killed in a distant war
Is not surprised to see us at his door,
And in a blend of jauntiness and gloom
Points at the puddles in his basement room.

But who can teach the thoughts we should roll-call
When morning finds us marching to the wall
Under the stage direction of some goon
Political, some uniformed baboon?
We'll think of matters only known to us--
Empires of rhyme, Indies of calculus;
Listen to the distant cocks crow, and discern
Upon the rough gray wall a rare wall fern;
And while our royal hands are being tied,
Taunt our inferiors, cheerfully deride
The dedicated imbeciles, and spit
Into their eyes just for the fun of it.

Nor can one help the exile, the old man
Dying in a motel, with the loud fan
Revolving in the torrid prairie night
And, from the outside, bits of colored light
Reaching his bed like dark hands from the past
Offering gems; and death is coming fast.
He suffocates and conjures in two tongues
The nebulae dilating in his lungs.

A wrench, a rift--that's all one can foresee.
Maybe one finds le grand neant; maybe
Again one spirals from the tuber's eye.

As you remarked the last time we went by
The Institute: ""I really could not tell
The difference between this place and Hell.""

We heard cremationists guffaw and snort
At Grabermann's denouncing the Retort
As detrimental to the birth of wraiths.
We all avoided criticizing faiths.
The great Starover Blue reviewed the role
Planets had played as landfalls of the soul.
The fate of beasts was pondered. A Chinese
Discanted on the etiquette at teas
With ancestors, and how far up to go.
I tore apart the fantasies of Poe,
And dealt with childhood memories of strange
Nacreous gleams beyond the adults' range.
Among our auditors were a young priest
And an old Communist. Iph could at least
Compete with churches and the party line.

In later years it started to decline:
Buddhism took root. A medium smuggled in
Pale jellies and a floating mandolin.
Fra Karamazov, mumbling his inept
All is allowed, into some classes crept;
And to fulfill the fish wish of the womb,
A school of Freudians headed for the tomb.

That tasteless venture helped me in a way.
I learnt what to ignore in my survey
Of death's abyss. And when we lost our child
I knew there would be nothing: no self-styled
Spirit would touch a keyboard of dry wood
To rap out her pet name; no phantom would
Rise gracefully to welcome you and me
In the dark garden, near the shagbark tree.

""What is that funny creaking--do you hear?""
""It is the shutter on the stairs, my dear.""

""If you're not sleeping, let's turn on the light.
I hate that wind! Let's play some chess."" ""All right.""

""I'm sure it's not the shutter. There--again.""
""It is a tendril fingering the pane.""

""What glided down the roof and made that thud?""
""It is old winter tumbling in the mud.""

""And now what shall I do? My knight is pinned.""

Who rides so late in the night and the wind?
It is the writer's grief. It is the wild
March wind. It is the father with his child.

Later came minutes, hours, whole days at last,
When she'd be absent from our thoughts, so fast
Did life, the wooly caterpillar run.
We went to Italy. Sprawled in the sun
On a white beach with other pink or brown
Americans. Flew back to our small town.
Found that my bunch of essay The Untamed
Seahorse was ""universally accalimed""
(It sold three hundred copies in one year).
Again school started, and on hillsides, where
Wound distant roads, one saw the steady stream
Of carlights all returning to the dream
Of college education. You went on
Translating into French Marvell and Donne.
It was a year of Tempests: Hurricane
Lolita swept from Florida to Maine.
Mars glowed. Shahs married. Gloomy Russians spied.
Lang made your portrait. And one night I died.

The Crashaw Club had paid me to discuss
Why Poetry Is Meaningful To Us.
I gave my sermon, a full thing but short.
As I was leaving in some haste, to thwart
The so-called ""question period"" at the end,
One of those peevish people who attend
Such talks only to say they disagree
Stood up and pointed his pipe at me.

And then it happened--the attack, the trance,
Or one of my old fits. There sat by chance
A doctor in the front row. At his feet
Patly I fell. My heart had stopped to beat,
It seems, and several moments passed before
It heaved and went on trudging to a more
Conclusive destination. Give me now
Your full attention.
I can't tell you how
I knew--but I did know that I had crossed
The border. Everything I loved was lost
But no aorta could report regret.
A sun of rubber was convulsed and set;
And blood-black nothingness began to spin
A system of cells interlinked within
Cells interlinked within cells interlinked
Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.

I realized, of course, that it was made
Not of our atoms; that the sense behind
The scene was not our sense. In life, the mind
Of any man is quick to recognize
Natural shams, and then before his eyes
The reed becomes a bird, the knobby twig
An inchworm, and the cobra head, a big
Wickedly folded moth. But in the case
Of my white fountain what it did replace
Perceptually was something that, I felt,
Could be grasped only by whoever dwelt
In the strange world where I was a mere stray.

And presently I saw it melt away:
Though still unconscious, I was back on earth.
The tale I told provoked my doctor's mirth.
He doubted very much that in the state
He found me in ""one could hallucinate
Or dream in any sense. Later, perhaps,
but not during the actual collapse.
No, Mr. Shade.""
""But, Doctor, I was dead!
He smiled. ""Not quite: just half a shade,"" he said.

However, I demurred. In mind I kept
Replaying the whole thing. Again I stepped
Down from the platform, and felt strange and hot,
And saw the chap stand up, and toppled, not
Because a heckler pointed with his pipe,
But probably because the time was ripe
For just that bump and wobble on the part
Of a limp blimp, an old unstable heart.

My vision reeked with truth. It had the tone,
The quiddity and quaintness of its own
Reality. It was. As time went on,
Its constant vertical in triumph shone.
Often when troubled by the outer flare
Of street and strife, inward I'd turn, and there,
There in the background of my soul it stood,
Old Faithful! And its presence always would
Console me wonderfully. Then, one day,
I came across what seemed a twin display.

It was a story in a magazine
About a Mrs. Z. whose heart had been
Rubbed back to life by a prompt surgeon's hand
She told her interviewer of ""The Land
Beyond the Veil"" and the account contained
A hint of angels, and a glint of stained
Windows, and some soft music, and a choice
Of hymnal items, and her mother's voice;
But at the end she mentioned a remote
Landscape, a hazy orchard--and I quote:
""Beyond that orchard through a kind of smoke
I glimpsed a tall white fountain--and awoke.""

If on some nameless island Captain Schmidt
Sees a new animal and captures it,
And if, a little later, Captain Smith
Brings back a skin, that island is no myth.
Our fountain was a signpost and a mark
Objectively enduring in the dark,
Strong as a bone, substantial as a tooth,
And almost vulgar in its robust truth!

The article was by Jim Coates. To Jim
Forthwith I wrote. Got her address from him.
Drove west three hundred miles to talk to her.
Arrived. Was met by an impassioned purr.
Saw that blue hair, those freckled hands, that rapt
Orchideous air--and knew that I was trapped.

""Who'd miss an opportunity to meet
A poet so distinguished?"" I was sweet
Of me to come! I desperately tried
To ask my questions. They were brushed aside.
""Perhaps some other time."" The journalist
Still had her scribblings. I should not insist.
She plied me with fruit cake, turning it all
Into an idiotic social call.
""I can't believe,"" she said, ""that it is you!
I loved your poem in the Blue Review.
That one about Mont Blanc. I have a niece
Who's climbed the Matternhorn. The other piece
I could not understand. I mean the sense.
Because, of course, the sound--But I'm so dense!""

She was. I might have persevered. I might
Have made her tell me more about the white
Fountain we both had seen ""beyond the veil""
But if (I thought) I mentioned that detail
She'd pounce upon it as upon a fond
Affinity, a sacramental bond,
Uniting mystically her and me,
And in a jiffy our two souls would be
Brother and sister trembling on the brink
Of tender incest. ""Well,"" I said, ""I think
It's getting late...""
I also called on Coates.
He was afraid he had mislaid her notes.
He took his article from a steel file:
""It's accurate. I have not changed her style.
There's one misprint--not that it matters much:
Mountain, not fountain. The majestic touch.""

Life Everlasting--based on a misprint!
I mused as I drove homeward: take the hint
And stop investigating my abyss?
But all at once it dawned on me that this
Was the real point, the contrapuntal theme;
Just this: not text, but texture; not the dream
But topsy-turvical coincidence,
Not flimsy nonsense, but a web of sense.
Yes! It sufficed that I in life could find
Some kind of link and bobolink, some kind
Or correlated pattern in the game,
Plexed artistry, and something of the same
Pleasure in it as they who played it found.

It did not matter who they were. No sound,
No furtive light came from their involute
Abode, but there they were, aloof and mute,
Playing a game of worlds, promoting pawns
To ivory unicorns and ebony fauns;
Kindling a long life here, extinguishing
A short one there; killing a Balkan king;
Causing a chunk of ice formed on a high-
Flying airplane to plummet from the sky
And strike a farmer dead; hiding my keys,
Glasses or pipe. Coordinating these
Events and objects with remote events
And vanished objects. Making ornaments
Of accidents and possibilities.

Stormcoated, I strode in: Sybil, it is
My firm conviction--""Darling, shut the door.
Had a nice trip?"" Splendid--but what is more
I have returned convinced that I can grope
My way to some--to some--""Yes, dear?"" Faint hope.

CANTO FOUR

Now I shall spy on beauty as none has
Spied on it yet. Now I shall cry out as
None has cried out. Now I shall try what none
Has tried. Now I shall do what none has done.
And speaking of this wonderful machine:
I'm puzzled by the difference between
Two methods of composing: A, the kind
Which goes on solely in the poet's mind,
A testing of performing words, while he
Is soaping a third time one leg, and B,
The other kind, much more decorous, when
He's in his study writing with a pen.
In method B the hand supports the thought,
The abstract battle is concretely fought.
The pen stops in mid-air, then swoops to bar
A canceled sunset or restore a star,
And thus it physically guides the phrase
Toward faint daylight through the inky maze.

But method A is agony! The brain
Is soon enclosed in a steel cap of pain.
A muse in overalls directs the drill
Which grinds and which effort of the will
Can interrupt, while the automaton
Is taking off what he has just put on
Or walking briskly to the corner store
To buy the paper he has read before.

Why is it so? Is it, perhaps, because
In penless work there is no pen-poised pause
And one must use three hands at the same time,
Having to choose the necessary rhyme,
Hold the completed line before one's eyes,
And keep in mind all the preceding tries?
Or is the process deeper with no desk
To prop the false and hoist the poetesque?
For there are those mysterious moments when
Too weary to delete, I drop my pen;
I ambulate--and by some mute command
The right word flutes and perches on my hand.

My best time is the morning; my preferred
Season, midsummer. I once overheard
Myself awakening while half of me
Still slept in bed. I tore my spirit free,
And caught up with myself--upon the lawn
Where clover leaves cupped the topaz of the dawn,
And where Shade stood in nightshirt and one shoe.
And then I realized that this half too
Was fast asleep; both laughed and I awoke
Safe in my bed as day its eggshell broke,
And robins walked and stopped, and on the damp
Gemmed turf a brown shoe lay! My secret stamp,
The Shade impress, the mystery inborn.
Mirages, miracles, midsummer morn.

Since my biographer may be too staid
Or know too little to affirm that Shade
Shaved in his bath, here goes:
""He'd fixed a sort
Of hinge-and-screw affair, a steel support
Running across the tub to hold in place
The shaving mirror right before his face
And with his toe renewing tap-warmth, he'd
Sit like a king there, and like Marat bleed.""

The more I weigh, the less secure my skin;
In places it's ridiculously thin;
Thus near the mouth: the space between its wick
And my grimace, invited the wicked nick.
Or this dewlap: some day I must set free
The Newport Frill inveterate in me.
My Adam's apple is a prickly pear:
Now I shall speak of evil and despair
As none has spoken. Five, six, seven, eight,
Nine strokes are not enough. Ten. I palpate
Through strawberry-and-cream the gory mess
And find unchanged that patch of prickliness.

I have my doubts about the one-armed bloke
Who in commercials with one gliding stroke
Clears a smooth path of flesh from ear to chin,
Then wipes his faces and fondly tries his skin.
I'm in the class of fussy bimanists.
As a discreet ephebe in tights assists
A female in an acrobatic dance,
My left hand help, and holds, and shifts its stance.
Now I shall speak...Better than any soap
Is the sensation for which poets hope
When inspiration and its icy blaze,
The sudden image, the immediate phrase
Over the skin a triple ripple send
Making the little hairs all stand on end
As in the enlarged animated scheme
Of whiskers mowed when held up by Our Cream.

Now I shall speak of evil as none has
Spoken before. I loathe such things as jazz;
The white-hosed moron torturing a black
Bull, rayed with red; abstractist bric-a-brac;
Primitivist folk-masks; progressive schools;
Music in supermarkets; swimming pools;
Brutes, bores, class-conscious Philistines, Freud, Marx
Fake thinkers, puffed-up poets, frauds and sharks.

And while the safety blade with scrap and screak
Travels across the country of my cheek,
Cars on the highway pass, and up the steep
Incline big trucks around my jawbone creep,
And now a silent liner docks, and now
Sunglassers tour Beirut, and now I plough
Old Zembla's fields where my gray stubble grows,
And slaves make hay between my mouth and nose.

Man's life as commentary to abstruse
Unfinished poem. Note for further use.

Dressing in all the rooms, I rhyme and roam
Throughout the house with, in my fist, a comb
Or a shoehorn, which turns into the spoon
I eat my egg with. In the afternoon
You drive me to the library. We dine
At half past six. And that odd music of mime
My versipel, is with me everywhere,
In carrel and in car, and in my chair.

And all the time, and all the time, my love
You too are there, beneath the word, above
The syllable, to underscore and stress
The vital rhythm. One heard a woman's dress
Rustle in the days of yore. I've often caught
The sound and sense of your approaching thought.
And all in you is youth, and you make new,
By quoting them, old things I made for you.

Dim Gulf was my first book (free verse); Night Rote
Came next; then Hebe's Cup, my final float
in that damp carnival, for now I term
Everything ""Poems,"" and no longer squirm.
(But this transparent thingum does require
Some moondrop title. Help me, Will! Pale Fire.)

Gently the day has passed in a sustained
Low hum of harmony. The brain is drained
And a brown ament, and the noun I meant
To use but did not, dry on the cement.
Maybe my sensual love for the consonne
D'appui, Echo's fey child, is based upon
A feeling of fantastically planned,
Richly rhymed life.
I feel I understand
Existence, or at least a minute part
Of my existence, only through my art,
In terms of combinatorial delight;
And if my private universe scans right,
So does the verse of galaxies divine
Which I suspect is an iambic line.
I'm reasonably sure that we survive
And that my darling somewhere is alive,
As I am reasonably sure that I
Shall wake at six tomorrow, on July
The twenty-second, nineteen fifty-nine,
And that the day will probably be fine;
so this alarm clock let me set myself,
Yawn, and put back Shade's ""Poems"" on their shelf.

But it's not bedtime yet. The sun attains
Old Dr. Sutton's last two windowpanes.
The man must be--what? Eighty? Eighty-two?
Was twice my age the year I married you.
Where are you? In the garden. I can see
Part of your shadow near the shagbark tree.
Somewhere horseshoes are being tossed. Click. Clunk.
(Leaning against its lamppost like a drunk.)
A dark Vanessa with a crimson band
Wheels in the low sun, settles on the sand
And shows its ink-blue wingtips flecked with white.
And through the flowing shade and ebbing light
A man, unheedful of the butterfly--
Some neighbor's gardener, I guess--goes by
Trundling an empty barrow up the lane.",John Francis Shade,1965,"[84, 86, 89]",3

And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'

Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Can't you see the fears that I'm feeling today?

Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space

Hate your next-door-neighbour, but don't forget to say grace

201,The Dawn Of Correction,"The western world has a common dedication
To keep free people from Red domination
And maybe you can't vote, boy, but man your battle stations
Or there'll be no need for votin' in future generations

So over and over again, you keep sayin' it's the end
But I say you're wrong, we're just on the dawn of correction

There are buttons to push in two mighty nations
But who's crazy enough to risk annihilation?
The buttons are there to ensure negotiation
So don't be afraid, boy, it's our only salvation

So over and over again, you keep sayin' it's the end
But I say you're wrong, we're just on the dawn of correction

You tell me that marches won't bring integration
But look what it's done for the voter registration
Be thankful our country allows demonstrations
Instead of condemnin', make some recommendations
I don't understand the cause of your aggravation
You mean to tell me, boy, it's not a better situation?

So over and over again, you keep sayin' it's the end
But I say you're wrong, we're just on the dawn of correction

You missed all the good in your evaluation
What about the things that deserve commendation?
Where there once was no cure, there's vaccination
Where there once was a desert, there's vegetation
Self-government's replacing colonization
What about the Peace Corp. organization?
Don't forget the work of the United Nations

So over and over again, you keep sayin' it's the end
But I say you're wrong, we're just on the dawn of correction
But I say you're wrong, we're just on the dawn of correction

So over and over again, you keep sayin' it's the end

When I am a man
I want to be happy
I want to be strong and free
Want to be brave like a soldier
What crayon should I use to color me

If you color him blue, son
He may not be a happy man
If you color him red, son
Someone may steal his land

If you color him green or yellow
He may be jealous and cowardly
If you color him black, son
He may never be free

Then he told his son
Put your crayons away

204,Just One Kiss From You,"All I need is just one kiss from you
To see me through
Just once more might I look in your eyes
You'd be so surprised
And might I say
I'd love you in every sweet way
All I need is just one kiss from you

For myself if I had just one wish
It would be just this
You my love, for now and forevermore
For that's all I live for
And sometimes at night
I'd dream of you and you're out of sight
Take me in your arms and need me too

I guess we'll always just be good friends
Seems there it will end
You know we're missing such a sweet romance
Our one and only chance
Be with me tonight
And I'll prove how our love can be so right

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?

We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

206,I Believe I'll Love On,"Who's the girl with the bright eyes?
Who's the boy she's sitting by?
Are they just friends?
Why is she so nice to me?
Why does she light up the room
When she smiles till i can't see
Clearly it must be
Love if you mean so much
When i barely even know you
But i hope that our hands might touch

Fight it, deny it
I'll fight it, deny it
I won't let myself fall in love

You see there's no point in trying
I'm only fooling with myself i'm not your type
But ill appreciate and stare at
Those gorgeous eyes i could fall into
And when I'm through I'll walk away but remember you
Give the girl you love the time of day
But dont jump right in and give your heart away

Fight it, deny it
Just fight it, deny it
Don't let yourself fall in love",Drew Danburry,1965,"[96, 97]",2
207,Autumn Leaves - 1965,"If you knew you were going to die before the lights turned off tonight would you reminisce or go about changing it? Five kids ranging from 14-18 alone in a stolen car, what could go wrong? There's nothing like pulling off the back roads onto the highway having the time of your life not really caring about the opinionated world that we all love so much. Driving past the speed limit signs that say 60 mph as you're going 90. We all live for something right? It's different for everybody though. It's scary knowing that there is no other human being genetically wired like you; nobody has your same story, or thinks like you. You are completely unique from head to toe. Scary right? It's what you do with your uniqueness that sets you apart from other people. But what if you knew your genetics could kill you? One poor decision and everything you've ever been taught, every good deed you've ever committed and all your friends, family, enemies, and people you love gone. It's reality that should scare you the most. Not your past, future, or even your present. It's reality. Nobody will ever fully know what you go through, nobody will ever fit in your shoes.  But how much does it cost to buy a new pair when you lost your originals that may not have been your favorite but it was all you had? It's things like this that make the cycle spin on a daily rotation. What do you live for? Is it a person, material possession, or an idea that you grab onto when there's no hope.
Tuesday October 12th 1965
Seconds go by, mere seconds not minutes not hours, seconds. What is a second to a lifetime? You'd be surprised how much your life can change in that second. Well nothing happened in these few seconds, he just sat down thinking. First he thought about the girl he left home three hours ago. A girl who's not really his but to him it feels like it. He finds himself thinking about that girl often. Too often to be honest. He can't close his eyes at night without dreaming about this girl. But right now that girl is not important. Right now his life is in danger, he doesn't know it yet but it is. He's out in the woods driving with his best friend who at the moment is too drunk to speak and going in and out of conciseness. There is no consequence to selfish decisions in the world he lives in. If nobody knows he won't get caught. But what he doesn't know is that the cave they are about to enter has a secret. A place people like to come and hotbox, have sex in, and even study in. The secret this cave contains is a secret nobody knows, nobody could tell you. No amount of thought or premonition could give it away. Nobody knows how long this secret has been imposed on this cave. Everyone who enters is taking a risk but somehow nobody knows it. He walks slowly with his drunken friend cradled in his arms. The leaves ruffle as they walk but quieter than usual. It is currently October so the wind chill is slightly picking up, and the sun is starting to go down. Not bad for 5 o'clock. There was nothing particularly interesting about this day. In the distance if you looked hard enough you would have seen an appealing rainbow. A polychromatous hidden behind a cloud. The leaves were a bright orange mixed with red. It covered the ground like snow in a crazy ruthless winter. The leaves crunched as they walked. It was breathtaking; some might even say a reason to live. A reason to go out and do something but today that was not the case. They continued walking as if their life depended on it. Little did they know, that statement could not have been truer. The sun was beginning to set; the sky was of the most beautiful shade. A purple mixed with orange. It seemed so beautiful but at the same time there was an eerie feeling to it. The man's drunken friend started vomiting on the leaves. They walked for 5 more minutes and came upon the cave. It was of moderate size, shallow, almost tunnel like. It was empty except for a log. They sat down upon it and stared at the walls in silence for a few minutes when it all started. The echoes. The screams. The flash of lights like someone flicked the switch down. 3 seconds of darkness, 2 of light. Blood all over the wall the color of autumn leaves. Some kind of love lost. Juxtaposition. Where is God? Who is God? Death in several forms. Regret, sorrow, remorse. It's all relative in any situation. Good morning. I hope you see me one day.

219,Early Morning Rain,"In the early morning rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
Im a long way from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early morning rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
But Im out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Well, the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
Shes rolling down at last
Hear the mighty engine roar
See the silver wing on high
Shes away and westward bound
Far above the clouds shell fly
Where the morning rain dont fall
And the sun always shines
Shell be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This old airport's got me down
Its no earthly good to me
'Cause Im stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
You can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So Id best be on my way
In the early morning rain
So Id best be on my way
In the early morning rain","Peter, Paul and Mary",1965,"[91, 96, 98]",3
220,I Need You So,"I need you so
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on

I need your arms
Around me tightly
Yes, I miss them nightly
When you're not at home

When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock upon the door

When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so

When the day is done

I'm yours forever and a day
With these hands, I will bring to you

No matter what you do

My poor heart
Was almost torn apart
Because you played a part
You thought that you were smart
And now you're gone
Gone, gone, girl

All your life
You treated me so bad
You took the love I had
And left me feeling sad
But I'll go on, on, on, girl

Cause I know that someday
Your time will be due

Ain't it true, ain't it true
Ain't it true

I don't want to be the one
To see you in such misery
Not even for the things
You went and done, done, done, girl

There is time for
You to change your mind
And leave your cheating heart behind
And turn the righteous kind
Come back to me, girl

And I will forgive you
Here's what I'll say
On that final day
They lay you away
There was never another like you

Ain't it true, girl
Ain't it true, girl

And I will forgive you
Here's what I'll say

They lay you away

223,Heartaches By The Number,"Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more

Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world would end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited, but you must have lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the number
And the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world will end",Ray Price,1965,"[41, 35, 36, 42, 52, 64, 79, 90]",8

229,These Hands (Small But Mighty),"Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.

It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.

""No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology,"" says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.

""It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families.... Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal"" (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.

""Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters."" ""Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea."" ""A field strewn with thorns."" ""All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.""

Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will show.

Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!

There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale's and Bennett's; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.

Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.

But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he the (leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.

First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, ""I hereby separate the whales from the fish."" But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.

The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows: ""On account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,"" and finally, ""ex lege naturae jure meritoque."" I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.

Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.

Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.

By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.

*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.

First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both small and large.

I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.

As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO, the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.

FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The SPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III. the FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the HUMP-BACKED WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM WHALE.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).—This whale, among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).—In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known as ""whale oil,"" an inferior article in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.

Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).—Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen's names for a few sorts.

In connection with this appellative of ""Whalebone whales,"" it is of great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.

But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.

BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).—This whale is often seen on the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).—Of this whale little is known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does anybody else.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).—Another retiring gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.

Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).

OCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which present may be numbered:—I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH; III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.

*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain. Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).—Though this fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).—I give the popular fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the best. Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL WHALE.—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; ""when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,"" saith Black Letter, ""on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor."" An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.

The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).—Of this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).—This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.

Thus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).

DUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.

To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is—i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).—This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).—A pirate. Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).—The largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the ""bright waist,"" that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.

Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.

Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever completing anything.

230,Tossing & Turning,"(Verse 1)
Tossing and turning, while your bridges are burning
By the skin of your teeth, you're made off like a thief
You're talking like a lover but, you weren't even talking to me
While you were driving, just avoiding the sirens
In the peak of summer heat, curled up at her feet
Begging for forgiveness, begging to be set free

(Pre- Chorus)
I'm waiting around
For things that come easy but, can not be found

(Verse 2)
Better than ignorance, living in bliss
Tongue tied on the weekends, like a fractured kid
She said you drive me crazy, watch me when I do this
And I was thinking, I got a lot to learn
Like how to give love and how to wait your turn
Cause' me, I'll be leaving soon, I got rubber to burn

(Chorus)
I'm waiting around
For things that come easy but, can not be found
And I sit back down
(sit back down)
Hoping one day that you'll come around
That you'll just come around

232,Like A Rolling Stone,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home

Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (igh!)

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?

238,Two Different Worlds,"(Intro: LL Cool J & Cydne Monet)
You know I don't understand why you treat me like this
It's almost like you feel like you're from two different worlds
(Well, we are Todd) I don't think so
You should have a listen to me right now

(LL Cool J)
I can feel it now baby I can feel it now, I can feel that
Even though you're a queen and I'm only a prince
I felt the magical between us ever since
The first time that I laid eyes on you
I want you to be my girl, so I can hold you
Caress you and let you know that I love you
And day by day my love grows
Heres' where I stand, I gotta be your man
I don't care if we're from two different worlds
But we're from...

(Cydne Monet)
Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds...
I don't understand the way you feel
But it's just a dream and it could never be real
So face to face I can't love you
We're from two, different worlds
Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds...

(LL Cool J)
Many things are different, birds and bees
Flowers and trees, you and me
But it really doesn't matter, it makes us stronger
There's more to talk about, we'll be together longer
Trustin' me, have faith in my love
It goes so deep, girl you're so sweet
As a matter of fact, I want you for my wife
Please be a part of my life

(Cydne Monet)
I can't believe you won't give up
Your love is strong but boy, so what (so what)
You can't love me, I can't love you
We're from two, different worlds... (it doesn't matter)
Two different, (two different) two different
We're from two different worlds (I don't care)
Two different (so what), two different worlds...

(LL Cool J & Cydne Monet)
It could never make a difference in my heart
(It could never make a difference)
Never could keep us apart (Whoooo... yeah)
Hold on (hold on) who cares what the world is sayin'?
(I do) My love goes so deep, (mmmm, baby), hold on
I know baby, let's take it to the climax
Two different, (two different) two different (so different)
We're from two different worlds (I don't care)
Two different (so what), two different worlds...

(LL Cool J)
So what's it gonna be, you wanna be with me?
I wanna be wit'chu, my love is true
All you gotta do is get into love
It's like a blessin' in disguise, sent from up above
This is your last chance, real not fate
Give me a break, don't make a mistake
Cause I'm for real, I want you for my girl
I don't care if we're from different worlds, but we're from

Two different, (two different) two different (so different)
We're from two different worlds (uh, I don't care)

Two different (have a heart honey), two different worlds... (I want you, I need you)
We're from two different worlds (take my hand honey)
Two different, (don't fool with the mood baby) two, different worlds (take me by hand)

So don't judge her too badly

What a sad environment

And when they couldn't pay the rent
It was 'cause her father was out
Getting liquored
Oh, the stone's been cast
And blood's thicker than water

And the sins of the family fall on the daughter
Yeah the sins of the family fall on the daughter

At the age of 16 she had been around more
Than any girl over 30
And the high I.Q's who condemned her
Knew she's a product of poor heredity

It's a fictitious fact when you fall on your back
You can backtrack failure with inspection, without exemption

All the sins of the family fall on the daughter
Yeah the sins of the family fall on the daughter

Oh, the devil is open to all of us
Heaven selects a precious few
And it takes some inside pull to get Gabriel
To make an angel of you

One can't live a lie then expect to die
With a soul in paradise
You know you gotta pay the price
Like you oughtta

And the day may come

Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distant atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and
Even in the valley

One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching
Down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees
The rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather
Spins out of hand
Go closer hold the land feel partly no more
Than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers
By in our hand
Next to your deepest fears we stand
Surrounded by a million years
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts

Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you've gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce the happiness we spent
We used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (Make romance to the music)

It's impossible to speak, but got-damn do it listen
Downtown, you can hear the crash, teachers just started class
Broken glass followed the impact (the matrix)
The intellects just waited for this day to come
Read the writing on the wall, red rum, White House claimed dumb
D.C. could feel it, concealed plans - we can't reveal it
Horns blown, can't seal it - ego torn, can't heal it

And the ghosts haunt dreams like Betelgeuse in house

And the fiends move along like nothing ever happened

Prepared to fight the greatest battle lyrically, in

How ever many years past when JC practiced carpentry in Bethlehem
Said the twin brothers would fall, and they did
Financial Districts, streets littered with the remnants of disbelief of what used to be
Custees, distributors and wholesalers are all dead
Not from the drug game, but real thug games
International relations, foreign policies, sticks and carrots
Wasn't even like their favorite national food, or even bad habit
For indigenous rabbits, intelligent scavengers
Knocked the infidels towers down - while its blood rushed uptown
From Wall Street to Hell's Kitchen
Morningside Heights back to Battery Park, see if you were with me would've seen

Explode like fagwa on the palate - Prince Vanderheart laughing from his palace

271,If I Didn't Love You,"[Verse 1]
Traffic lights shining in my eyes
Through the pouring rain
We had a terrible fight tonight
And I can't stand the pain
I've been searching for hours and hours
Up and down these lonely streets
I feel scared and alone and so incomplete

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be here if I didn't love you
I wouldn't be here if I didn't care
I wouldn't waste your time or my time
In a love that's going nowhere

[Verse 2]
It's been building up for quite sometime
Something had to break
But to just end it all like this
Would be the worst mistake
I know I don't wanna live without you
I know exactly what you mean to me
And I believe that inside we still hold the key

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be here if I didn't love you
I wouldn't be here if I didn't care
I wouldn't waste your time or my time
In a love that's going nowhere
I wouldn't be here if I didn't love you
(I wouldn't be here, baby)
Freezing cold in the pouring rain
All I wanna do is find you
Let me set you home again

[Bridge]
Someday we gonna look back on this
Throw away the cross we had to bear
We'll have a laugh and we'll have a kiss
We'll say all is fair

[Chorus]
I wouldn't be here if I didn't love you
I wouldn't be here if I didn't care (if I didn't care)
I wouldn't waste your life or my life
In a love that's going nowhere

282,Me Without You,"Pale horse songs of a slow decline
Sideshow words if the songs don't mind
G-d gave Noah the rainbow sign
No more water, is the H-Bomb next time?
Pale horse vows in a grave (I-do-yes-definitely) reply
Smile for the camera at a 'church' nearby
Threw a mute curse at the Boise sky
For my fucked up Napoleon-of-St.-Helena-hairline
Black horse leaping when the frogs withdrew
The parable of the plums where the olives grew
Clouded rearrangement of sounds we knew:
An Idaho sunset for my own private Waterloo
Pale horse songs of a slow decline
Side show words if our moms don't mind:
Cloud gave no one a rainbow sign--
Six-point starred ink flag next time?

שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ ה' אֶחָד     قل هو الله احد الله الصمد

With imperial crowns we were 'sent,'
Riding out conquest-bent
Daylight is breaking
Weilding the sanctified sword
For the army of the Scarecrow Lord
Daylight is breaking
Balancing scales at our feet
Measuring out two pounds of barley, six pounds of buckwheat

Beasts of the Battersea Shield
At the opening of the fourth seal
The sky, I'd been told
Would roll up like a scroll
As the mountains and islands moved from their place
And the sun would turn black
As a dead raven's back
But there'd be nowhere hide
From the Judge's face
After which message-less birds take flight without cause
To the silence they've heard in the absence of laws
Or imperial crowns: Unsent, unsigned--

The other night I dreamt I was finally out of college
In my own pair of sandals, I had turned into my father
Whistling our tune about the Rio Grande
Like an anchorite in June I took hold of my own hand
And started on the Abrahamic joke we knew
About apostrophes and pronouns and you-remember-who
""But let's keep that silly punchline between me and you
Little Haroon
And the man in the moon.""",​mewithoutYou,1965,"[95, 95]",2

Walk along the lake with someone new
Have yourself a summer fling or two
But remember I'm in love with you and
Save your heart for me

When the summer moon is on the rise
And you're dancin' under starlit skies
Please don't let stars get in your eyes, just
Save your heart for me

When you're all alone, far away from home
Someone's gonna flirt with you-ou
I won't think it's wrong if you play along
Just don't fall for someone new

When the autumn winds begin to blow
And the summertime is long ago
You'll be in my arms again I know, so

Lookin' through the eyes of love (lookin' through the eyes of love)
Lookin' through the eyes of love when she looks at me-ee

I can't get no, I can't get no

288,I'm A Fool,"[Verse 1]
I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels
Last year we killed the game and left y'all browsing for the clues
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth
Money talks and hoes say it's an arousing point of view
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shed truth
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see life through a wider scope
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler
I just play the game homie, I ain't make the rules up
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television
Got no plans of seeing hell or prision
You can tell I'm living, right?
Never said I'm living right

I'm a fool
Such a fool

Boy you a fool

And they like
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool, hundred thou to go to school
So much debt me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool
The first to go to college, they say knowledge is a tool
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool
Meanwhile, she back home working hard, I use that as my fuel
So I finally graduated but I'm sad to say it
I ain't learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it
I'm a fool, no scuffs on my shoes
No cuts, I don't bruise, so fuck y'all reviews
She told me ""Cole, I love you rode with you way before the riches
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches
And calling brothas niggas, pardon if I cross a line
But all this time knew you was different than all them other niggas""
I responded to her ""please don't put me on a pedestal
Cuz I know better and I'm still a fool""

You had trouble with the engine
But that car sure made it out of town
No youre right
I agree with your decision
You seem happy now
I know love goes away
Now girl youre living proof
When hearts break
One of them always stays
And I could use a little you

I could use a little road trip to forget
Take a little cruise ship to sea
But its a sure bet I wont get far
Without you with me

295,Soul Heaven,"Last night I dreamed I was at a concert
So many people, you had to stand in line
One night only in Soul Heaven
I didn't wanna wake up
I was having such a good time
All of The Bar-Kays were tuning up on stage
Jimi had his guitar, gettin' ready to play
Sam was singing ""A Change Gonna Come""
Otis was there, sittin' at the dock of the bay

There was a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
Standing room only, so you better hurry
Buy your ticket cause they're going fast

'Trane & Miles took a mean solo
Jr. Walker had 'em dancing in the aisles (Shoot 'em 'fore they run, now)
They stood up when Jackie sang ""Lonley Teardrops""
When Sammy (Davis, Jr.) danced, the crowd went wild (Mr. Bojangles)
I think I saw Ella standing with Mahalia
Backstage with Elvis with his blue suede shoes
It started raining, everybody just stayed there
To hear Z.Z. sing the ""Down Home Blues""

Well there's a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
Standing room only, so you better hurry
Buy your ticket cause they're going fast

There's a party in Soul Heaven
Superstars from the past
The great Al Jackson was a holding down the beat
When Marvin sang ""Let's Get It On"", they jumped to
Their feet
Everyone started screaming and gave a standing ovation
When the curtain came up with the mighty Temptations
King Curtis blew the ""Soul Serenade""
Thought I saw Lady Day sittin' in the shade
I got two lovers and I ain't ashamed
Lord I love the way sweet Mary sings
It was getting kinda late, it was time to go
2Pac and Biggie, they closed the show
(Boo!)
I didn't wanna wake up, I was having such a good time
I didn't wanna wake up, I was having such a good time
Pearl Bailey, she was there
Duke and Count, they were there
Woah Hathaway, I saw him there
Dizzie and Satchmo, I saw 'em there
It was a party in Soul Heaven
You shoulda been there
I know, you shoulda been there
Everyone was having such a good time

She were lying in the bathroom
I was banging on the door
She was crying in a puddle

You better come out or I'm kicking it in""
The door unlocked, my heart stops
I throw woah-woah-woah, she says

A 24-hour garage
And it's in my hand
And this telephone is average
But it's worth a grand
A gang of youths

Your money or you're Nikes, do I have to choose?
All pride lost, still in my socks
I throw woah-woah-woah, I thought

You wouldn't be useful if you knew
That everything you say and do
Potentially could change tomorrow
And then you're last asleep
(???)
Don't mention me when you're along those years

[Verse 3]
Life is just a beer garden
A sunny afternoon
There's always one drunk hardman
Singing out of tune
A plastic chair flies through the air
The lager tops go everywhere
The jukebox clicks, the record sticks
And we throw woah-woah-woah, everybody says

[Chorus]
Don't just stand, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, do something
Don't just stand, don't just stand there
Don't just stand there, do something

I spit it back at them they be asking who's backing them
But nobody it's me and my best friend with the lifelong vision eventually going platinum
So they laugh in my face and there's cash in my safe
See it's actually fake I'm on an Acura pace
And if you're down with always being surrounded by
Women who take shots 'til they feel nostalgic
Show me somebody truly happy and known in love
See that's all the above
See I'm calling your bluff
Trying embalming your stuff
Hit up the mall and get bust
Homies be calling me up
Hope I don't fall if I jump

[Verse 1]
Everyday I need an ounce and a half, S.P
The only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

Aiyyo I
Smoke like a chim-in-ney {*inhaling*}, matter fact I
Smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes, I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

[Verse 3]
I'mma smoke till my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

Bubble gum and taffy
Skip to the sweet shop with my sweetheart Sandy
Got my pennies saved, so I'm her sugar daddy
I'm her Hume Cronyn, she's my Jessica Tandy

[Hook]
I want candy!

Put it in a pile
Split it wit my biddy

Talkin chocodile smiles

Do it to your daddy
Embarrass your whole family
Just cause you came between a kid and his candy

[Hook]
I need candy

[Verse 5]
Any kind'll do
Don't care if it's nutritious or FDA approved
It's gonna make me spaz like bobcats on booze
A hyperactive juice
That only I can produce

[Bridge]
And use a giant drill, bore straight into hell
Releasing ancient demons from their sleep-forever spell
So they can walk upon the earth, and get resituated
And hawk the diet pills MC Pee Pants have created

[Hook]
I need candy

[Verse 6]
Must have candy
Eat candy til I'm dead
I'll kill you for some candy
Gimme candy, candyhead
Where you keepin all the candy?
Who made you candy King?
If you don't give me some candy I will make the ladies sing!

Guess I really miss you after all

And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you
And I'll always need you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will love you

Wish you'd never left me but love's a mystery
You can break a heart so easily
The days and nights reveal how much I feel for you
Time has come for me to see how much your love has meant to me

And I'll always love you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will love you

Time like a river keeps on rollin' right on by
Nothing left for me to do
So I watch the river rise

And I'll always love you

I do love you

""—perfectly fine, that's fine!""

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga, brother who you standing with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me ""Decapitate everything for what it's worth!""
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
See the canvas as a planet I'm commanding with my nerves, ah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing

Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions

Nothin' different now (woo!) all around now (woo!)
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena

Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

[Verse 3: Joba]
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end

They say democracy is simply very bad for business
While deploring student protests in the middle of Hong Kong
They insist that people have to work on zero contracts everywhere
So profit margins grow and shares are very strong

And one question that they never seem to ask is:

What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!

They're buying football clubs today with absolute impunity
And so much of the media to give themselves the power
To destroy the very notion and the feeling of community
While poisoning the public discourse hour by hour
But although it never seems to make it into Hansard
The question at some point must still be answered, oh

What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!

What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
What are we gonna do about the rich?
Come on, well come on!

While the welfare state collapses
Their extravagance and arrogance
Their lack of checks to balance this

What are we gonna do about the rich?

Cos all it takes is:

One dying and a buryin'
One dying and a buryin'

Oh...I wanna be free
Free from all this heartache and regret
And free from pining for the love I can't forget

Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape

And when we try to put love back together
There's always a few
Little pieces you can't find

330,Canadian Sunset,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part",The Avalanches (Surf Rock Band),1965,"[92, 76, 83, 92]",4

337,Nobody Knows What's Goin' On (In My Mind But Me),"[Jamie Madrox]
When you slip into reality
Hoes wanna straddle me
Player haters wanna battle me
But I shed em' all like calories
Prophecy preacher, lend your ear and I'll reach ya
And if your willing to be taught I'mma teach ya
I'm not a people person, truth is I can't stand too many people
So many fake the funk and perpetrate and call me evil
But evil is a harsh word
Tell the mockingbird that I said it
A man of my word I won't regret it
If I let it get to me like it get to them I'm no better
The same message over and over with different set-up
Player hating is a art of a scandalous and shafty person
Some do it oh so well I'll be damned if they don't rehearse it
Disperse it to people like me and you everyday
And they expect the common man to turn his cheek and walk away
And now I pray for an end of the madness
No more sadness
? to my people that preside to be the baddest
And all that they do and say
But overshadowed by a cloud turning night to day
Its so tremendous that you couldn't even walk away
If you chose to, you even suppose to watch the ones you close  to, now that's insane
Tell me will it change, I'm confused
Not a thing to lose
This shit is far from positive and saddens like the Blues
Paying dues ain't the only part of duties that bestow to the chosen
Spitting lyrics in the microphone and
Dodging player haters till my temper hit the ceiling
And this how they got a nigga feelin
I done fell into reality

One day it's goin hit me like a ton of bricks
I'm feeling so sick
One of my dogs passed and shit
I'm feeling like killing 'em all
But whats that solve?
He's still goin be dead in the morning
Why take the fall?
Inside I be so mad I'm finna burst
Instead of Chevy's, my homies rolling in the back of a hearse
You know what's worse?
It's too hard to cope with some days
Murderous ways
Leaving me shaking in a daze
Comatose, completely tore up
Nerves be so bad I wanna throw up
I'm 'bout to blow up
In a rage, I need to talk nobody wanna listen
On the corner, murder mind state condition
Overload, pull the trigger
Stress got the best of suicide, pour out some liquor
Another grave digger gets paid
Digging our grave for senseless ways
Keep to ourselves and stay paid
All of my dogs can't die, I visit the sky
And reminisce when I'm high
I'm never goin lie
I got love for peoples, dead or alive
Or we can smoke out in the ride in my memory

[Hook 1x]
Reality is just a fragment
A fragment inside of my soul
My eyes are closed
My head is spinning
My head is spinning
I swear to god I don't know

[Jamie Madrox]
This is a musical masterpiece dedicated to down riders
Keep it in your clique, fuck the outsiders
People hating on everything and everything's the same
Everybody is a player and life is a silly game
It's a damn shame
Daddy died 11 years today
I wonder if he know I'm doing straight
Could you tell him something if you see my pops before I do?
Let him know that he's remembered by my crew
And everyday, in my mind, anyplace, anytime
Looking in the sky for the seventh sign

[Monoxide Child]
I walk around, nobody knows what I do
Sealin' fates and date rapes
As my body transcends through this portal of life
Smoking blunts, wronging my rights
I live for the night because I melt in the light
Completely outta site
For facts so unknown
So grotesque never stated on microphones
So alone in this fucked up world, it sucks dick
Everybody got a problem with something and you can bet
I be the last one, more like the last dragon
No swords to ever let this world contort
The way you're thinking, it's so essential
It gives us all the potential
To take over the world in our mentals
If I can't live my life the way I wanna live my life
Then why can't I die?
Why can't I die?

And I can't call to it
Cause my mouth is on it

Cause my ears are on it),
Can't even think about it

341,I've Cried My Last Tear,"When you left me lonely here
I thought that I would drown in tears
As one was wiped away
Another one would take its place
Drop by drop, as time went by
I slowly ran that river dry
Until I finally realized today

That I've cried my last tear for you
Wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
It's been raining pain since you walked out
But, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I've cried my last tear for you

Well, I used to lay alone in bed
With my pillow soaking wet
And all of those lonely nights
I thought there was no end in sight
I cried my heart out over you
But then I cried the hurt out too
It took a while, but now I'll be alright

But I've cried my last tear for you
Wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
Well, it's been raining pain since you walked out
But, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I've cried my last tear for you
Yes, baby, I've cried my last tear for you",Ricky Van Shelton,1965,"[94, 98]",2

Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand

[Verse 3]
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

[Verse 4]
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

346,Laurie (Strange Things Happen),"Last night at the dance I met Laurie
So lovely and warm, an angel of a girl
Last night I fell in love with Laurie -
Strange things happen in this world

As I walked her home
She said it was her birthday
I pulled her close and said
""Will I see you anymore?""
Then suddenly she asked for my sweater
And said that she was very, very cold

I kissed her goodnight
At her door and started home
Then thought about my sweater
And went right back instead
I knocked at her door and a man appeared
I told why I'd come, then he said:

""You're wrong, son
You weren't with my daughter
How can you be so cruel
To come to me this way?
My Laurie left this world on her birthday -
She died a year ago today.""

A strange force drew me to the graveyard
I stood in the dark
I saw the shadows wave
And then I looked and saw my sweater
Lyin' there upon her grave

Wish and dreams come true, but not for me

348,Seein' The Right Love Go Wrong,"[Intro - April Nhem]
‘Cause I’m not good at faking
And you know I can’t take it I need love, I need love……

[Verse One - Kixxie Siete]
There’s some things I’ve been meaning to talk about
I get this funny feeling everytime you walk in the house
& I don’t know why
Everytime I ask you a question I’m already assuming you gon lie
Days have gon by, Im waiting like I’m stuck in a long line
Im patient but its been such a long time
& Since I, never really see them come down my own eyes
When I write I’m letting the song cry
I know you the right one but maybe we just met at the wrong time?
I got a lot to say, baby I hope you don’t mind
Hoping you don’t let go
I’m hoping that you’ll hold on
But if you got to leave me then so long
‘Cause I can't take it
& I don’t know how long this can go on
It’s something we can no longer prolong
It’s just kinda funny that you had me feeling like nothing can go wrong
But its no fun when you’re the one the jokes on

[Chorus - April Nhem]
It’s been way too long
And Im not, not that strong
I can’t I can’t do it I can't
‘Cause I see In your eyes that Your Not By My Side
Oh Woah
‘Cause im not good at faking
And you know that I can't take it
I need love, I need love

[Verse Two - Kixxie Siete]
So why all of a sudden you tryna to argue with me?
You tryna end this relationship that you started with me?
Because you tell me lies, then you make it harder for me
To realize that you’re actually drifting farther from me
Keep floating baby I hope you reach the shore
And in the end I hope that you grab what you’re reaching for
But if you don’t find it don’t come crying
Cause you know I showed you love unlike anything you’ve seen before
I swear I’ve seen it all
We’ve built this shit from the ground up
& Now it’s pretty sad that we got to see it fall
When Im alone, I constantly check my phone
And I’m hoping but I know that I’ll probably will never reieceve a call
Unaware that I was speaking to a ghost
I don’t think you was here when I needed you the most
Now I’m reminsicing on all the things we use to do
Am I in love with you or am I just use to you?

[Chorus - April Nhem]
It’s been way too long
And Im not, not that strong
I can’t I can’t do it
I can't
‘Cause I see In your eyes that Your Not By My Side
Oh Woah
‘Cause im not good at faking
And you know that I can't take it
I need love, I need love

[Verse Three - April Nhem]
I know you don’t see me the way I see you
We’ve grown so far apart
I just can’t make it hard
You have been so complicated
You see me when I’m frustrated
Never tell a lie
Always stayed by your side
While you were getting high
Feeling all alone
When I shouldve known
Should’ve been strong
Now its time to say good bye
Oh boyyyyy

[Chorus - April Nhem]
It’s been way too long
And Im not, not that strong
I can’t I can’t do it I can't

Still my woman loves and has faith in me
But how long can a good thing last
Though I'm proud never to hurt her in the past
Will she be there waitin' for me
Five long years when I will be free

And I just can't work no longer
I've got to see my woman right now
And we ain't gettin' any younger

350,"Theme From ""Harlow"" (Lonely Girl)","The days of my youth, as I look back on them, seem to fly away from me in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car. In my sanitary relations with women I was practical, ironical and brisk. While a college student, in London and Paris, paid ladies sufficed me. My studies were meticulous and intense, although not particularly fruitful. At first, I planned to take a degree in psychiatry as many manqué talents do; but I was even more manqué than that; a peculiar exhaustion, I am so oppressed, doctor, set in; and I switched to English literature, where so many frustrated poets end as pipe-smoking teachers in tweeds. Paris suited me. I discussed Soviet movies with expatriates. I sat with uranists in the Deux Magots. I published tortuous essays in obscure journals. I composed pastiches:

... Fraulein von Kulp
may turn, her hand upon the door;
I will not follow her. Nor Fresca. Nor
that Gull.

A paper of mine entitled ""The Proustian theme in a letter from Keats to Benjamin Bailey"" was chuckled over by the six or seven scholars who read it. I launched upon an ""*Histoire abrégée de la poésie anglaise*"" for a prominent publishing firm, and then started to compile that manual of French literature for English-speaking students (with comparisons drawn from English writers) which was to occupy me throughout the forties--and the last volume of which was almost ready for press by the time of my arrest.
I found a job--teaching English to a group of adults in Auteuil. Then a school for boys employed me for a couple of winters. Now and then I took advantage of the acquaintances I had formed among social workers and psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions, such as orphanages and reform schools, where pale pubescent girls with matted eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted one in dreams.
Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as ""nymphets"".
It will be marked that I substitute time terms for spatial ones. In fact, I would have the reader see ""nine"" and ""fourteen"" as the boundaries--the mirrory beaches and rosy rocks--of an enchanted island haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a vast, misty sea. Between those age limits, are all girl-children nymphets? Of course not. Otherwise, we who are in the know, we lone voyagers, we nympholepts, would have long gone insane. Neither are good looks any criterion; and vulgarity, or at least what a given community terms so, does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty, soul-shattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where Lolita plays with her likes. Within the same age limits the number of true nymphets is strikingly inferior to that of provisionally plain, or just nice, or ""cute"", or even ""sweet"" and ""attractive,"" ordinary, plumpish, formless, cold-skinned, essentially human little girls, with tummies and pigtails, who may or may not turn into adults of great beauty (look at the ugly dumplings in black stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into stunning stars of the screen). A normal man given a group photograph of school girls or Girl Scouts and asked to point out the comeliest one will not necessarily choose the nymphet among them. You have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy, with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a super-voluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle spine (oh, how you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once, by ineffable signs--the slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate--the little deadly demon among the wholesome children; *she* stands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power.
Furthermore, since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the matter, the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a gap of several years, never less than ten I should say, generally thirty or forty, and as many as ninety in a few known cases, between maiden and man to enable the latter to come under a nymphet's spell. It is a question of focal adjustment, of a certain distance that the inner eye thrills to surmount, and a certain contrast that the mind perceives with a gasp of perverse delight. When I was a child and she was a child, my little Annabel was no nymphet to me; I was her equal, a faunlet in my own right, on that same enchanted island of time; but today, in September 1952, after twenty-nine years have elapsed, I think I can distinguish in her the initial fateful elf in my life. We loved each other with a premature love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives. I was a strong lad and survived; but the poison was in the wound, and the wound remained ever open, and soon I found myself maturing amid a civilization which allows a man of twenty-five to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve.                                          No wonder, then, that my adult life during the European period of my existence proved monstrously twofold. Overtly, I had so-called normal relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins of peas for breasts; inly, I was consumed by a hell furnace of localized lust for every passing nymphet whom as law-abiding poltroon I never dared approached. The human females I was allowed to wield were but palliative agents. I am ready to believe that the sensations I derived from natural fornication were much the same as those known to normal big males consorting with their normal big mates in that routine rhythm which shakes the world. The trouble was that those gentlemen had not, and I *had*, caught glimpses of an incomparably more poignant bliss. The dimmest of my pollutive dreams was a thousand times more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of genius or the most talented impotent might imagine. My world was split. I was aware of not one but two sexes, neither which was mine; both would be termed female by the anatomist. But to me, through the prism of my senses, ""they were as different as mist and mast."" All this I rationalize now. In my twenties and early thirties, I did not understand my throes quite so clearly. While my body knew what it craved for, my mind rejected my body's every plea. One moment I was ashamed and frightened, another recklessly optimistic. Taboos strangulated me. Psychoanalysts wooed me with pseudoliberations of pseudolibidoes. The fact that to me the only objects of amorous tremor were sisters of Annabel's, her handmaids and girl-pages, appeared to me at times as a forerunner of insanity. At other times I would tell myself that it was all a question of attitude, that there was really nothing wrong in being moved to distraction by girl-children. Let me remind my reader that in England, with the passage of Children and Young Person Act in 1993, the term ""girl-child"" is defined as ""a girl who is over eight but under fourteen years"" (after that, from fourteen to seventeen, the statutory definition is ""young person""). In  Massachusetts, U.S., on the other hand, a ""wayward child"" is, technically, one ""between seven and seventeen years of age"" (who moreover, habitually associates with vicious or immoral persons). Hugh Broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign of James the First, has proved that Rahab was a harlot at ten years of age. This is all very interesting, and I daresay you see me already frothing at the mouth in a fit; but no, I am not; I am just winking happy thoughts into a little tiddle cup. Here are some more pictures. Here is Virgil who could be the nymphet sing in a single tone, but probably preferred a lad's perineum. Here are two of King Akhnaten's and Queen Nefertiti's pre-nubile Nile daughters (that royal couple had a litter of six), wearing nothing but many necklaces of bright beads, relaxed on cushions, intact after three thousand years, with their soft brown puppy-bodies, cropped hair and long ebony eyes. Here are some brides of ten compelled to seat themselves on fascinum, the virile ivory in the temples of classical scholarship. Marriage and cohabitation before the age of puberty are still not uncommon in certain East Indian provinces. Lepcha old men of eighty copulate with girls of eight, and nobody minds. After all, Dante fell madly in love with his Beatrice when she was nine, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely, and bejeweled, in a crimson frock, and this was in 1274, in Florence, at a private feast in the merry month of May. And when Petrarch fell madly in love with his Laureen, she was a fair-haired nymphet of twelve running in the wind, in the pollen and dust, a flower in flight, in the beautiful plain as descried from the hills of Vaucluse.                               But let us be prim and civilized. Humbert Humbert tried hard to be good. Really and truly, he did. He had the utmost respect for ordinary children, with their purity and vulnerability, and other no circumstances would he have interfered with the innocence of a child, if there was the least risk of a row. But how his heart beat when, among the innocent throng,he espied a demon child, ""*enfant charmante et fourbe,*"" dim eyes, bright lips, ten years in jail if you only show her you are looking at her. So life went. Humbert was perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for. The bud-stage breast development appears early (10.7 years) in the sequence of somatic changes accompanying pubescence.  And the next maturational item available is the first appearance of pigmented pubic hair (11.2 years). My little cup brims with tiddles.                                                       A shipwreck. An atoll. Alone with a drowned passenger's shivering child. Darling, this is only a game! How marvellous were my fancied adventures as I sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a trembling book. Around the quiet scholar, nymphets played freely, as if he were a familiar statue or part of an old tree's shadow and sheen. Once a perfect little beauty in tartan frock, with a clatter put her heavily armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into me and tighten the strap of her roller skate, and I dissolved in the sun, with my book for fig leaf, as her auburn ringlets fell all over her skinned knee, and the shadow of leaves I shared pulsated and melted on her radiant limp next to my chameleonic cheek. Another time a red-haired school girl hung over me in the *métro*, and a revelation of axillary russet I obtained remained in my blood for weeks. I could list a great number of these one-sided diminutive romances. Some of them ended in a rich flavor of hell. It happened for instance that from my balcony I would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of undressing before a co-operative mirror. Thus isolated, thus removed, the vision acquired an especially keen charm that made me race with all speed toward my lone gratification. But abruptly, fiendishly, the tender pattern of nudity I had adored would be transformed into the disgusting lamp-lit bare arm of a man in his underclothes reading his paper by the open window in the hot, damp, hopeless summer night.                 Rope-skipping, hopscotch. That old woman in black who sat next to me on my bench, on my wrack of joy (a nymphet was groping under me for a lost marble), and asked if I had a stomachache, the insolent hag. Ah, leave me alone in my pubescent park, in my mossy garden. Let them play around me forever. Never grow up.",Vladimir Nabokov,1965,"[61, 64, 66, 82, 90]",5

I get so dizzy when you're standing near
It's not the music that you hear
My heart is beating like a jungle drum

Let's take the minutes as they speed away

When you're in love to-morrow never comes

Let's forget about tomorrow

Let's forget about tomorrow for
Tomorrow never comes!

353,I'm A Fool To Care,"(Both)
I'm a fool to care when you treat me this way
I know I love you but what can I do, I'm a fool to care
I'm a fool to cry when you tell me goodbye
You left me so blue when you were untrue, I'm a fool to care

I know I should laugh and call it a day
But I know I would cry if you went away

354,My Man,"[Intro]
Ohh, ohh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Boy, you let me down
I am so confused
I stood right by your side
Through everything that you went through
Why is she around?
Why are you so cruel?
How could you just turn your back
When I stood by you?

When you were broke, I didn't leave you
Somehow, through it all, I believed in you
No, no, no
My, my, my
'Cause he would never hurt me
Let alone, just desert me
No, no, no
My, my, my

[Verse 2]
Word around town
Is that you live with her
And you said she took your heart away, oh baby
I told them, that's a lie
Cause I don't wanna hear no bullshit stories 'bout my man
(Can't stop the screamin' and yellin')
Oh, no, no, no, no
My pain, oh no
No, I just can't believe that you're with her
Is she the one you played me for?
Shoulda noticed it the day she walked in the door
I just can't believe she stole my man
Oh, my man (Oh, yeah)
She walked right in the door
Looked me in the face, and she took my man
Never trust a lonely woman with the one you love
She ate dinner at my table, even watched my kids
And she took my man
Bitch actin' like she was my friend
She called me 'bout her man
Well, I didn't understand
She was talkin' 'bout my man (heifer)
Oh my man, my man, my man, my man, my man
My man, man, man, man, woo!

[Bridge]
Is this my life?
It cuts me like a knife
To know the one I love could leave me for a friend
I'm not desperate, but I would reconsider (baby, are you sorry?)
All the years I put in this thing to be a winner
I know it's too late
She took my man (took my man)

[Outro]
See, I was just a fool
Didn't wanna see the truth, and she took my man

355,After Loving You,"Now that I have known love as sweet as yours
Love so very deep and complete as yours
Hunger for your lips, pains of jealousy
After loving you, what is left for me

Head and heart and soul, overpowered by love
I forget that there was a God above
Tortured by the things that I couldn't see
After loving you, what is left for me

Leave me and my voice would become so still
And my touch would be winter's icy chill
Leave me and my eyes would be full of rain
And the need of you surging through and through
Would drive me insane

Loving you so much that it tears my heart
That would hurt me less than to be apart
So it will remain till eternity
There's no other world that is worth passing through
After holding you
After kissing you
After loving you",Charles Aznavour,1965,"[95, 99]",2
356,We're Doing Fine,"[Chorus]

I was never really good at goodbyes
The sunsets starting to die
Cause I keep saying that I can make this right
I'm nothing that I wanted to be
It's taken so long to see
It's me and the dark of the night
And we're doing fine

[Verse 1]
I think I'm falling for the last time
All the thoughts in my head always spinning around
They're telling me to let go
I try to block them out cause I already know

I never thought that I'd feel so empty
I'd look away, but I'd just feel dizzy

You got me fighting on the front line
You're the weight around my legs always puling me down
I'm trying for the last time
Cause you were never there when I started to drown

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm falling for the look in your eyes, always spinning around me
I never thought that I'd feel so empty
I'd look away, but I'd just feel dizzy

[Chorus]
I was never really good at goodbyes
The sunsets starting to die
Cause I keep saying that I can make this right
I'm nothing that I wanted to be
It's taken so long to see
It's me and the dark of the night
And we're doing fine

[Bridge]
I'm falling apart
And floating away
I'm lost in the sea
But I'm not running away
(I'm always running away)
I burn like a star
To show you the way
I'll bury my heart
Cause it can carry the weight

[Chorus]
I was never really good at goodbyes
The sunsets starting to die
Cause I keep saying that I can make this right
I'm nothing that I wanted to be
It's taken so long to see
It's me and the dark of the night
And we're doing fine

357,Where Were You When I Needed You,"Don't bother crying, don't bother calling
It's all over now, no use in stalling
The love once I felt
I don't feel anymore for you
This time I'll even open the door for you
You walked out when I was down
Well, now I'm well off
And look, look who's coming 'round

Where were you when I needed ya
Where were you when I wanted ya
Where were you when I needed ya
Where?

You're looking good
It's hard to fight it
There's no use explaining
I've already decided
That living with you
Is worse than without you
I won't spend a lifetime a-worriying about you
Things get rough and you disappeared
Now I'm back on my feet
And look, look who is standing there

Where were you when I needed ya
Where were you when I wanted ya
Where were you when I needed ya
Where?

You were so young and you were so wild
I knew you were nobody's innocent child
The first day I saw you
You really got to me
I thought I could change you
What good did it to me?
Things got rough and you couldn't wait
Now you're tripping back
But babe, babe it's too late

Where were you when I wanted ya

They say heaven's a place
Yeah, heaven's a place and they know where it is
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
And when they hear the beat, coming from the street, they lock the door
But if there's no music up in heaven, then what's it for?
When I hear the beat, the spirit's on me like a live-wire
A thousand horses running wild in a city on fire
It starts in your feet, then it goes to your head
And if you can't feel it, then the rules are dead
And if you're the judge, what is our crime?
Here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
Here comes the night

360,A Walk In The Black Forest,"[Original is an instrumental music]
[Vocals recorded by Salena Jones]
The trees join hands and say, ""Hello,""
And suddenly ev'rywhere we go
The sun beams through in fun
The leaves form patterns like a heart
And whisper forever ""Never part.""
Be true, 'cause I love you
Shadows write words of love across our path;
Birds sing ""How lucky those whose love just grows together.""
Blades of grass stand on and on
And chatter together in a calm
That's green and so serene
A mem'ry of our walk of love
In a dream, a stream goes by
Reflecting a message from the sky above
And here and there we look around
To see other lovers who have found
Their way
Crickets tap out their symphony in code;
Rabbits run helter skelter finding shelter here
And flowers swaying in the breeze
Look up to the branches of the trees
And sing as birds take wing
All this is true 'cause I love you",Horst Jankowski,1965,"[35, 29, 14, 12, 13, 13, 16, 29, 38, 44, 55, 70, 90]",13

Far away from the days where I wouldn't wanna go home

You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't eat
You don't even do a goddamn thing

I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the - corner, any day
Tryin to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I'm thinkin' 'bout my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of indo and my mind can't take the stress, I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self; but I see death around the corner

Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas that was buggin'

They front like they your homies but they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who'd care
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
Got homies in my head that done passed away screamin' ""Please!""
Young nigga, make G's
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless, I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner

(I was raised) I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kiddy
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household
And drinkin' liquor til' you out cold
And though I'm grown now, nigga it's still on - Pow!
Bustin on them niggas 'til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta be suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless, them bitches'll start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murder me now but see me later man, that's on my pops
I got homies that will hunt you 'til you drop
I hope the Lord can forgive me
I was a G and gettin' high was a way of bein' free

A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business

You fuckin hump?)
Y'all niggas stop actin' like pussies out there, all right
If any of you..
Are tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like that...
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!

You mean so much to me
You don’t even understand it
There’s so many days and nights the songs i write
I all just planned it

My mind runs overtime don’t undermine how you fixed this damage
You’re always down for me how I’m down for you I won’t take you for granted

Girl you got what I need
Your love is my extasy
Always Need you right next to me
Fuck them other bitches texting me

I spent so much time on you
But we did it collectively
Now I gotta go and grind for you
Cuz you’ve always been checking me

I remember all those days and nights
Told me I was gonna make it right
Told me you was gonna Change my life
But i was going through my darkest nights

Loving me when I was cold as ice
Hugging me I know you felt the spikes
I have never been in love like this before
I’m tryna make it right

I’m just tryna keep you nameless
I ain’t tryna make you famous
Nigga gon run these songs back and find out what your name is

Kept it low can they blame us

But I wouldn't trade my yakety axe, even for a T-bone

I'm confessin' I never took a lesson, all my notes are a matter of guessin'
Hopin' they'll come out in some kinda manner that'll make the yakety sound

And at  the bottom of the oak
Where you oh so softly spoke
That we'd been lucky all our lives
We'll never catch the wind

Raise a glass my dear, my love
Every time you think of love
And the frustration you would hide
And you've been lucky all your life
But you'll never catch the wind

And I played all your childish games
And we'd never learn to say every time you weren't so brave
I'd never seen that face
But in my heart, it's you I crave
You can hate it all you want
You'll never catch the wind
I know all is said and done
And we don't talk at all, not once
And I regret I've filled my lungs
With every single song I've sung
Oh we were never meant to win
How I even thought to think it
Now it's beating at my limbs
I'll never catch the wind

Just raise a glass my dear, my love

And sat on the sideway
He said I'm leaving baby
And listen just to what I say
I said I can't make you stay if you won't go
But if it's hard time baby you should know

One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So if you still wanna go, go ahead
And I mean every word I said

[Verse 2]
My baby thought I was jivin'
And he went right out the door
He left me about three in the morning
Hmm, I got me a man at four
Woman cry when they man leave [?]
But I found my something a long time ago

One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So when he gets too big for his pants

And cry when he walk out the door
'Cause I was just young and simple
Ah! Ain't like this no more

But I'm here to tell I should know

One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show

I been knowing you for long enough
Damn I need you right now

Baby it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (tonight)

Wakin' up, she on it
Good love in the mornin'
Get on top my cojones

This don't come with no warranty
You want it but can't afford it
My world is different than your's
You're opinion of me is glory
Glorifying in all these foreign
Back to future, and DeLorean

Cars imported, girls imported
In subordinate, get deported

Gotta whole lot in store for ya
Birkin bags, purple tags

I saw a light shine from a window
And as I looked again
Your face came into sight

I couldn't walk on
Until you'd gone from your window
I had to make you mine
I knew you were the one

Oh, I would be so glad
Just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be so true
And I'd live my life for you

So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from a window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight

397,Back In My Arms Again,"Oooh
All day long I hear my telephone ring
Friends calling giving their advice
From the boy I love I should break away
Cause heartaches he'll bring one day

I lost him once through friends' advice
But it's not gonna happen twice
Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights

Ooh!
But now he's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied

It's easy for friends to say let him go
But I'm the one who needs him so
It's his love that makes me strong
Without him I can't go on

This time I'll live my life at ease
Being happy lovin' whom I please
And each time we make romance
I'll be thankful for a second chance

Ooh!
Cause he's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
Ooh!

How can Mary tell me what to do
When she lost her love so true?
And Flo, she don't know
Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo

I listened once to my friends' advice
But it's not gonna happen twice
Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights

They call me the voodoo woman
I look through water and spy dry land

I got a rabbit foot in my pocket, a toad frog in my shoes
A craw fish on my shoulder, lookin' dead at you
I got dust from a rattlesnake, I got a black spider bone
If that don't do it baby, you'd better leave it all alone

They call me the voodoo woman

399,Before And After,"[Текст песни «До и после»]

[Интро: Зараза]
Медлить здесь нельзя, поверь, а то и вовсе
Всё, что освещает над тобою солнце
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»

[Куплет 1: Horus]
Тянуло за тонкую грань, как барана к новым воротам
Ты зовёшь это ""круг интересов""?
Я бы назвал — круговой обороной от мира всего
Не покорясь князю мира сего
Тот, кто не от мира сего
Никогда и не станет по жизни светлой лошадкою
(Чёрной вороной)
Там где за дверями стужа
Эта глушь любые крики глушит
Тут твой скепсис никому не важен
Чужой сепсис никому не нужен
Едва родился — уже что-то должен
Этим погонам, попам, чинушам (тс-с)
И лишь одна отдушина
То, что везёт тебе знакомый пушер
Суета — хуета
И не ищи в ней какой-то толк
Томление духа и маета
Экклезиаст — рил ток
Я был такой же энтузиаст:
Всё гнул горб, да копил впрок
Чтобы потом мог себе позволить
Земляной бугор и роскошный гроб

[Припев: Зараза]
Медлить здесь нельзя, поверь, а то и вовсе
Всё, что освещает над тобою солнце
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»
Медлить здесь нельзя, поверь, а то и вовсе
Всё, что освещает над тобою солнце
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»

[Куплет 2: Зараза]
Смотрит косо смерть косая
Под собою всё кромсая
Под косою черепная —
Вот и смерть очередная
И она предпочитает
Правосудие слепых бьёт под дых
Забирает и старых, и молодых
Перепрыгнуть не всем дано — адовы костры
Можно сгинуть и постить с чёрной ленточкой посты
Смерть как вирус, и мы все с рождения заражены
Тут нет больше живых — после нескольких ножевых
Сложно выжить, и я не хочу выживать, а ты?
Тут все с минами, будто хлебнули мёртвой воды
Сложно выжить, и я не хочу выживать, а ты?
Чтобы вынырнуть, следуй за светом из темноты

[Припев: Зараза]
Медлить здесь нельзя, поверь, а то и вовсе
Всё, что освещает над тобою солнце
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»
Медлить здесь нельзя, поверь, а то и вовсе
Всё, что освещает над тобою солнце
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»

[Аутро: Зараза]
Медлить здесь нельзя, поверь, а то и вовсе
Всё, что освещает над тобою солнце
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»
Смерть разделит надвое — на «до» и «после»",Horus & Зараза (zarazA),1965,"[42, 17, 17, 17, 25, 30, 39, 50, 65]",9
400,Last Chance To Turn Around,"The wheels of my old car are a'turnin, burnin' up the highway
Tonight that girl of mine will be yearnin' for not learnin' to see things my way
She hurt me for the very last time, I'm not hangin' around
I'll show her I can leave her behind
I'm gettin' out of town (I'm gettin' out of town)
I won't back down (I won't back down)
I won't back down (I won't back down)

Last exit to Brooklyn, last chance to turn around
Last exit to Brooklyn, gonna keep these wheels of mine coverin' ground

Last night I caught that girl lyin', tryin' to deceive me
And now all of these tears she's cryin' I'm not buyin' you better believe me
She swore that she was mine alone, our love would never die
I'm leavin' now for parts unknown
I saw her with that guy (I saw her with that guy)
That's the reason why (that's the reason why)
I'll be passin' by (I'll be passin' by)

The last exit to Brooklyn, the last chance to turn around
The last exit to Brooklyn, gonna keep these wheels of mine coverin' ground
On the last exit to Brooklyn, the last chance to turn around
The last exit to Brooklyn, the last chance to turn around

I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)

I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

Watch the way he shuffles his feet
My, he holds his head up high
When he goes walking by, he's my guy

When he holds my hand, I'm so proud
Cause he's not just one of the crowd
My baby's always the one to try the things they've never done
And just because of that, they say

He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever does what he should
But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love

He's always good to me, always treats me tenderly
Cause he's not a rebel, oh, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, oh, no, no, no, to me

If they don't like him that way
They won't like me after today
I'll be standing right by his side when they say

He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever does what he should
Just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why we can't share a love

He's always good to me, good to him, I try to be

To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
Everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers

If by chance she find new romance, warmer lips to kiss her
Arms to hold her tighter, stirring new fires inside her
How I wish that it was me instead of he that stands beside her

Something you couldn't hide on a shelf

Because I know for myself

When a boy is in love
And the world to him is a beatiful place
When a boy is in love
He's up and he's gone
There's no breakfast for him
Cause he lives on the love of his sweet little gem
The days not through, though it's not very long
Before he must talk to his girl on the phone
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

His girl's voice on the phone brings him wondrous delight
When a boy is in love
If there's been any darkness, it all fades from sight
When a boys in love
He can hardly wait til the moment they meet
For he knows when he sees her his day will be complete
When they're finally alone and he kisses her lips
The world sings a love song and his heart turns a flip
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

At the end of the day the time comes they must part
The strings of regret tear away at his heart
And late in the night as he sleeps on his bed
Visions of her sweet song, how they dance in his head
And before you know he is buying a ring
To capture forever that sweet darling thing

This hunger started growing in me

Now that was the birth of our love affair
And since then it's grown a thousand times

And I'm so glad that you're mine

And it's wonderful to be in love with you, oh, yes it is
It's so nice to know that you love me too

No one in this world is perfect
But you're the closest to perfection as one can be

The feeling of my tender love

Oh, a double clutchin' weasel like me can hardly ever get
A girl to look at him that way
Smilin' like the girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel

Wow, what a girl wearin' nothin' but a smile and a towel
In the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago

BOOK THIRD.
THE MODE OF OBTAINING THE GRACE OF CHRIST. THE BENEFITS IT CONFERS, AND THE EFFECTS RESULTING FROM IT.

CHAPTER 17.
THE PROMISES OF THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL RECONCILED.

In the following chapter, the arguments of Sophists, who would destroy or impair the doctrine of Justification by Faith, are reduced to two classes. The former is general, the latter special, and contains some arguments peculiar to itself. I. The first class, which is general, and in a manner contains the foundation of all the arguments, draws an argument from the promises of the law. This is considered from sec.  1-3. II. The second class following from the former, and containing special proofs. An argument drawn from the history of Cornelius explained, sec. 4, 5. III. A full exposition of those passages of Scripture which represent God as showing mercy and favor to the cultivators of righteousness, sec. 6. IV. A third argument from the passages which distinguish good works by the name of righteousness, and declare that men are justified by them, sec. 7, 8. V. The adversaries of justification by faith placed in a dilemma. Their partial righteousness refuted, sec. 9, 10. VI. A fourth argument, setting the Apostle James in opposition to Paul, considered, sec. 11, 12. VII.  Answer to a fifth argument, that, according to Paul, not the hearers but the doors of the law are justified, sec. 13. VIII. Consideration of a sixth argument, drawn from those passages in which believers boldly submit their righteousness to the judgment of God, and ask him to decide according to it, sec. 14. IX. Examination of the last argument, drawn from passages which ascribe righteousness and life to the ways of believers, sec. 15.

Sections.
1. Brief summary of Chapters 15 and 16. Why justification is denied to works. Argument of opponents founded on the promises of the law. The substance of this argument. Answer. Those who would be justified before God must be exempted from the power of the law. How this is done.
2. Confirmation of the answer ab impossibili, and from the testimony of an Apostle and of David.
3. Answer to the objection, by showing why these promises were given.  Refutation of the sophistical distinction between the intrinsic value of works, and their value er parts.
4. Argument from the history of Cornelius. Answer, by distinguishing between two kinds of acceptance. Former kind. Sophistical objection refuted.
5. Latter kind. Plain from this distinction that Cornelius was accepted freely before his good works could be accepted. Similar explanations to be given of the passage in which God is represented as merciful and propitious to the cultivators of righteousness.
6. Exposition of these passages. Necessary to observe whether the promise is legal or evangelical. The legal promise always made under the condition that we ""do,"" the evangelical under the condition that we ""believe.""
7. Argument from the passages which distinguish good works by the name of righteousness, and declare that man is justified by them. Answer to the former part of the argument respecting the name. Why the works of the saints called works of righteousness. Distinction to be observed.
8. Answer to the second part of the argument--viz. that man is justified by works. Works of no avail by themselves; we are justified by faith only. This kind of righteousness defined. Whence the value set on good works.
9. Answer confirmed and fortified by a dilemma.
10. In what sense the partial imperfect righteousness of believers accepted. Conclusion of the refutation.
11. Argument founded on the Epistle of James. First answer. One Apostle cannot be opposed to another. Second answer. Third answer, from the scope of James. A double paralogism in the term Faith. In James the faith said not to justify is a mere empty opinion; in Paul it is the instrument by which we apprehend Christ our righteousness.
12. Another paralogism on the word justify. Paul speaks of the cause, James of the effects, of justification. Sum of the discussion.
13. Argument founded on Rom. 2:13. Answer, explaining the Apostles meaning. Another argument, containing a reduction ad impossibili. Why Paul used the argument.
14. An argument founded on the passages in which believers confidently appeal to their righteousness. Answer, founded on a consideration of two circumstances. 1. They refer only to a special cause. 2. They claim righteousness in comparison with the wicked.
15. Last argument from those passages which ascribe righteousness and life to the ways of believers. Answer. This proceeds from the paternal kindness of God. What meant by the perfection of saints.

1. Let us now consider the other arguments which Satan by his satellites invents to destroy or impair the doctrine of Justification by Faith. I think we have already put it out of the power of our calumniators to treat us as if we were the enemies of good works--justification being denied to works not in order that no good works may be done or that those which are done may be denied to be good; but only that we may not trust or glory in them, or ascribe salvation to them. Our only confidence and boasting, our only anchor of salvation is, that Christ the Son of God is ours, and that we are in him sons of God and heirs of the heavenly kingdom, being called, not by our worth, but the kindness of God, to the hope of eternal blessedness.  But since, as has been said, they assail us with other engines, let us now proceed to demolish them also. First, they recur to the legal promises which the Lord proclaimed to the observers of the law, and they ask us whether we hold them to be null or effectual. Since it were absurd and ridiculous to say they are null, they take it for granted that they have some efficacy. Hence they infer that we are not justified by faith only. For the Lord thus speaks: ""Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep and do them, that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers; and he will love thee, and bless thee and multiply thee,"" (Deut. 7:12, 13). Again, ""If ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor; if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt: then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever,"" (Jer. 7:5-7). It were to no purpose to quote a thousand similar passages, which, as they are not different in meaning, are to be explained on the same principle. In substance, Moses declares that in the law is set down ""a blessing and a curse,"" life and death (Deut.  11:26); and hence they argue, either that that blessing is become inactive and unfruitful, or that justification is not by faith only. We have already shown, that if we cleave to the law we are devoid of every blessing, and have nothing but the curse denounced on all transgressors. The Lord does not promise any thing except to the perfect observers of the law; and none such are any where to be found.  The results therefore is that the whole human race is convicted by the law, and exposed to the wrath and curse of God: to be saved from this they must escape from the power of the law, and be as it were brought out of bondage into freedom,--not that carnal freedom which indisposes us for the observance of the law, tends to licentiousness, and allows our passions to wanton unrestrained with loosened reins; but that spiritual freedom which consoles and raises up the alarmed and smitten conscience, proclaiming its freedom from the curse and condemnation under which it was formerly held bound. This freedom from subjection to the law, this manumission, if I may so express it, we obtain when by faith we apprehend the mercy of God in Christ, and are thereby assured of the pardon of sins, with a consciousness of which the law stung and tortured us.

2. For this reason, the promises offered in the law would all be null and ineffectual, did not God in his goodness send the gospel to our aid, since the condition on which they depend, and under which only they are to be performed--viz. the fulfillment of the law, will never be accomplished. Still, however the aid which the Lord gives consists not in leaving part of justification to be obtained by works, and in supplying part out of his indulgence, but in giving us Christ as in himself alone the fulfillment of righteousness. For the Apostle, after premising that he and the other Jews, aware that ""a man is not justified by the works of the law,"" had ""believed in Jesus Christ,"" adds as the reason, not that they might be assisted to make up the sum of righteousness by faith in Christ, but that they ""might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law,"" (Gal. 2:16).  If believers withdraw from the law to faith, that in the latter they may find the justification which they see is not in the former, they certainly disclaim justification by the law. Therefore, whose will, let him amplify the rewards which are said to await the observer of the law, provided he at the same time understand, that owing to our depravity, we derive no benefit from them until we have obtained another righteousness by faith. Thus David after making mention of the reward which the Lord has prepared for his servants (Ps. 25 almost throughout), immediately descends to an acknowledgment of sins, by which the reward is made void. In Psalm 19, also, he loudly extols the benefits of the law; but immediately exclaims, ""Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults,"" (Ps. 19:12). This passage perfectly accords with the former, when, after saying, ""the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies,"" he adds, ""For thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity: for it is great,"" (Ps. 25:10, 11). Thus, too, we ought to acknowledge that the favor of God is offered to us in the law, provided by our works we can deserve it; but that it never actually reaches us through any such desert.

3. What then? Were the promises given that they might vanish away without fruit? I lately declared that this is not my opinion. I say, indeed, that their efficacy does not extend to us so long as they have respect to the merit of works, and, therefore, that, considered in themselves, they are in some sense abolished. Hence the Apostle shows, that the celebrated promise, ""Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them,"" (Lev. 18:5; Ezek. 20:10), will, if we stop at it, be of no avail, and will profit us not a whit more than if it were not given, being inaccessible even to the holiest servants of God, who are all far from fulfilling the law, being encompassed with many infirmities. But when the gospel promises are substituted, promises which announce the free pardon of sins, the result is not only that our persons are accepted of God, but his favor also is shown to our works, and that not only in respect that the Lord is pleased with them, but also because he visits them with the blessings which were due by agreement to the observance of his law. I admit, therefore, that the works of the faithful are rewarded with the promises which God gave in his law to the cultivators of righteousness and holiness; but in this reward we should always attend to the cause which procures favor to works. This cause, then, appears to be threefold. First, God turning his eye away from the works of his servants which merit reproach more than praise, embraces them in Christ, and by the intervention of faith alone reconciles them to himself without the aid of works. Secondly the works not being estimated by their own worth, he, by his fatherly kindness and indulgence, honors so far as to give them some degree of value.  Thirdly, he extends his pardon to them, not imputing the imperfection by which they are all polluted, and would deserve to be regarded as vices rather than virtues. Hence it appears how much Sophists were deluded in thinking they admirably escaped all absurdities when they said, that works are able to merit salvation, not from their intrinsic worth, but according to agreement, the Lord having, in his liberality, set this high value upon them. But, meanwhile, they observed not how far the works which they insisted on regarding as meritorious must be from fulfilling the condition of the promises, were they not preceded by a justification founded on faith alone, and on forgiveness of sins--a forgiveness necessary to cleanse even good works from their stains. Accordingly, of the three causes of divine liberality to which it is owing that good works are accepted, they attended only to one: the other two, though the principal causes, they suppressed.

4. They quote the saying of Peter as given by Luke in the Acts, ""Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him"" (Acts 10:34, 35). And hence they infer, as a thing which seems to them beyond a doubt, that if man by right conduct procures the favor of God, his obtaining salvation is not entirely the gift of God. Nay, that when God in his mercy assists the sinner, he is inclined to mercy by works. There is no way of reconciling the passages of Scripture, unless you observe that man's acceptance with God is twofold. As man is by nature, God finds nothing in him which can incline him to mercy, except merely big wretchedness. If it is clear then that man, when God first interposes for him, is naked and destitute of all good, and, on the other hand, loaded and filled with all kinds of evil,--for what quality, pray, shall we say that he is worthy of the heavenly kingdom?  Where God thus clearly displays free mercy, have done with that empty imagination of merit. Another passage in the same book--viz. where Cornelius hears from the lips of an angel, ""Thy prayer and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God,"" (Acts 10:4), is miserably wrested to prove that man is prepared by the study of good works to receive the favor of God. Cornelius being endued with true wisdom, in other words, with the fear of God, must have been enlightened by the Spirit of wisdom, and being an observer of righteousness, must have been sanctified by the same Spirit; righteousness being, as the Apostle testifies, one of the most certain fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:5).  Therefore, all those qualities by which he is said to have pleased God he owed to divine grace: so far was he from preparing himself by his own strength to receive it. Indeed, not a syllable of Scripture can be produced which does not accord with the doctrine, that the only reason why God receives man into his favor is, because he sees that he is in every respect lost when left to himself; lost, if he does not display his mercy in delivering him. We now see that in thus accepting, God looks not to the righteousness of the individual, but merely manifests the divine goodness towards miserable sinners, who are altogether undeserving of this great mercy.

5. But after the Lord has withdrawn the sinner from the abyss of perdition, and set him apart for himself by means of adoption, having begotten him again and formed him to newness of life, he embraces him as a new creature, and bestows the gifts of his Spirit. This is the acceptance to which Peter refers, and by which believers after their calling are approved by God even in respect of works; for the Lord cannot but love and delight in the good qualities which he produces in them by means of his Spirit. But we must always bear in mind, that the only way in which men are accepted of God in respect of works is, that whatever good works he has conferred upon those whom he admits to favor, he by an increase of liberality honors with his acceptance. For whence their good works, but just that the Lord having chosen them as vessels of honor, is pleased to adorn them with true purity? And how are their actions deemed good as if there was no deficiency in them, but just that their merciful Father indulgently pardons the spots and blemishes which adhere to them? In one word, the only meaning of acceptance in this passage is, that God accepts and takes pleasure in his children, in whom he sees the traces and lineaments of his own countenance. We have else here said, that regeneration is a renewal of the divine image in us. Since God, therefore, whenever he beholds his own face, justly loves it and holds it in honor, the life of believers, when formed to holiness and justice, is said, not without cause, to be pleasing to him. But because believers, while encompassed with mortal flesh, are still sinners, and their good works only begun savor of the corruption of the flesh, God cannot be propitious either to their persons or their works, unless he embraces them more in Christ than in themselves. In this way are we to understand the passages in which God declares that he is clement and merciful to the cultivators of righteousness. Moses said to the Israelites, ""Know, therefore, that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations."" These words afterwards became a common form of expression among the people. Thus Solomon in his prayer at the dedication says, ""Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart,"" (1 Kings 8:23). The same words are repeated by Nehemiah (Neh. 1:5). As the Lord in all covenants of mercy stipulates on his part for integrity and holiness of life in his servants (Deut. 29:18), lest his goodness might be held in derision, or any one, puffed up with exultation in it, might speak flatteringly to his soul while walking in the depravity of his heart, so he is pleased that in this way those whom he admits to communion in the covenant should be kept to their duty. Still, however, the covenant was gratuitous at first, and such it ever remains. Accordingly, while David declares, ""according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me,"" yet does he not omit the fountain to which I have referred; ""he delivered me, because he delighted in me,"" (2 Sam. 22:20, 21). In commending the goodness of his cause, he derogates in no respect from the free mercy which takes precedence of all the gifts of which it is the origin.

6. Here, by the way, it is of importance to observe how those forms of expression differ from legal promises. By legal promises, I mean not those which lie scattered in the books of Moses (for there many Evangelical promises occur), but those which properly belong to the legal dispensation. All such promises, by whatever name they may be called, are made under the condition that the reward is to be paid on the things commanded being done. But when it is said that the Lord keeps a covenant of mercy with those who love him, the words rather demonstrate what kind of servants those are who have sincerely entered into the covenant, than express the reason why the Lord blesses them.  The nature of the demonstration is this: As the end for which God bestows upon us the gift of eternal life is, that he may be loved, feared, and worshipped by us, so the end of all the promises of mercy contained in Scripture justly is that we may reverence and serve their author. Therefore, whenever we hear that he does good to those that observe his law, let us remember that the sons of God are designated by the duty which they ought perpetually to observe, that his reason for adopting us is, that we may reverence him as a father. Hence, if we would not deprive ourselves of the privilege of adoption, we must always strive in the direction of our calling. On the other hand, however, let us remember, that the completion of the Divine mercy depends not on the works of believers, but that God himself fulfill the promise of salvation to those who by right conduct correspond to their calling, because he recognizes the true badges of sons in those only who are directed to good by his Spirit. To this we may refer what is said of the members of the Church, ""Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart,"" &c. (Ps. 15:1, 2). Again, in Isaiah, ""Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He that walketh righteously,"" &c. (Isa. 33:14, 15). For the thing described is not the strength with which believers can stand before the Lord, but the manner in which our most merciful Father introduces them into his fellowship, and defends and confirms them therein. For as he detests sin and loves righteousness, so those whom he unites to himself he purifies by his Spirit, that he may render them conformable to himself and to his kingdom. Therefore, if it be asked, What is the first cause which gives the saints free access to the kingdom of God, and a firm and permanent footing in it? the answer is easy. The Lord in his mercy once adopted and ever defends them. But if the question relates to the manner, we must descend to regeneration, and the fruits of it, as enumerated in the fifteenth Psalm.

7. There seems much more difficulty in those passages which distinguish good works by the name of righteousness, and declare that man is justified by them. The passages of the former class are very numerous, as when the observance of the commandments is termed justification or righteousness. Of the other classes we have a description in the words of Moses, ""It shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments,"" (Deut. 6:25). But if you object, that it is a legal promise, which, having an impossible condition annexed to it, proves nothing, there are other passages to which the same answer cannot be made; for instance, ""If the man be poor,"" ""thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goes down:"" ""and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the Lord thy God,"" (Deut. 24:13). Likewise the words of the prophet, ""Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore,"" (Psal. 106:30, 31). Accordingly the Pharisees of our day think they have here full scope for exultation.  For, as we say, that when justification by faith is established, justification by works falls; they argue on the same principle, If there is a justification by works, it is false to say that we are justified by faith only. When I grant that the precepts of the law are termed righteousness, I do nothing strange: for they are so in reality.  I must, however, inform the reader, that the Hebrew word [?] has been rendered by the Septuagint, not very appropriately, dikaio'mata, justifications, instead of edicts. But I readily give up any dispute as to the word. Nor do I deny that the Law of God contains a perfect righteousness. For although we are debtors to do all the things which it enjoins, and, therefore, even after a full obedience, are unprofitable servants; yet, as the Lord has deigned to give it the name of righteousness, it is not ours to take from it what he has given. We readily admit, therefore, that the perfect obedience of the law is righteousness, and the observance of any precept a part of righteousness, the whole substance of righteousness being contained in the remaining parts. But we deny that any such righteousness ever exists. Hence we discard the righteousness of the law, not as being in itself maimed and defective, but because of the weakness of our flesh it nowhere appears. But then Scripture does not merely call the precepts of the law righteousness, it also gives this name to the works of the saints: as when it states that Zacharias and his wife ""were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless,"" (Luke 1:6). Surely when it thus speaks, it estimates works more according to the nature of the law than their own proper character. And here, again, I must repeat the observation which I lately made, that the law is not to be ascertained from a careless translation of the Greek interpreter. Still, as Luke chose not to make any change on the received version, I will not contend for this. The things contained in the law God enjoined upon man for righteousness but that righteousness we attain not unless by observing the whole law: every transgression whatever destroys it. While, therefore, the law commands nothing but righteousness, if we look to itself, every one of its precepts is righteousness: if we look to the men by whom they are performed, being transgressors in many things, they by no means merit the praise of righteousness for one work, and that a work which, through the imperfection adhering to it, is always in some respect vicious.

8. I come to the second class (sec. 1, 7, ad init.), in which the chief difficulty lies. Paul finds nothing stronger to prove justification by faith than that which is written of Abraham, he ""believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness,"" (Rom. 4:3; Gal. 3:6).  Therefore, when it is said that the achievement of Phinehas ""was counted unto him for righteousness,"" (Psal. 106:30, 31), we may argue that what Paul contends for respecting faith applies also to works. Our opponents, accordingly, as if the point were proved, set it down that though we are not justified without faith, it is not by faith only; that our justification is completed by works. Here I beseech believers, as they know that the true standard of righteousness must be derived from Scripture alone, to consider with me seriously and religiously, how Scripture can be fairly reconciled with that view. Paul, knowing that justification by faith was the refuge of those who wanted righteousness of their own, confidently infers, that all who are justified by faith are excluded from the righteousness of works. But as it is clear that this justification is common to all believers, he with equal confidence infers that no man is justified by works; nay, more, that justification is without any help from works. But it is one thing to determine what power works have in themselves, and another to determine what place they are to hold after justification by faith has been established. If a price is to be put upon works according to their own worth, we hold that they are unfit to appear in the presence of God: that man, accordingly, has no works in which he can glory before God, and that hence, deprived of all aid from works, he is justified by faith alone. Justification, moreover, we thus define: The sinner being admitted into communion with Christ is, for his sake, reconciled to God; when purged by his blood he obtains the remission of sins, and clothed with righteousness, just as if it were his own, stands secure before the judgment-seat of heaven. Forgiveness of sins being previously given, the good works which follow have a value different from their merit, because whatever is imperfect in them is covered by the perfection of Christ, and all their blemishes and pollutions are wiped away by his purity, so as never to come under the cognizance of the divine tribunal. The guilt of all transgressions, by which men are prevented from offering God an acceptable service, being thus effaced, and the imperfection which is wont to sully even good works being buried, the good works which are done by believers are deemed righteous, or; which is the same thing, are imputed for righteousness.

9. Now, should any one state this to me as an objection to justification by faith, I would first ask him, Whether a man is deemed righteous for one holy work or two, while in all the other acts of his life lie is a transgressor of the law? This were, indeed, more than absurd. I would next ask, Whether he is deemed righteous on account of many good works if he is guilty of transgression in some one part? Even this he will not venture to maintain in opposition to the authority of the law, which pronounces, ""Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them,"" (Deut. 27:26). I would go still farther and ask, Whether there be any work which may not justly be convicted of impurity or imperfection? How, then, will it appear to that eye before which even the heavens are not clean, and angels are chargeable with folly? (Job 4:18). Thus he will be forced to confess that no good work exists that is not defiled, both by contrary transgression and also by its own corruption, so that it cannot be honored as righteousness. But if it is certainly owing to justification by faith that works, otherwise impure, unclean, defective, unworthy of the sight, not to say of the love of God, are imputed for righteousness, why do they by boasting of this imputation aim at the destruction of that justification, but for which the boast were vain? Are they desirous of having a viper's birth? To this their ungodly language tends.  They cannot deny that justification by faith is the beginning, the foundation, the cause, the subject, the substance, of works of righteousness, and yet they conclude that justification is not by faith, because good works are counted for righteousness. Let us have done then with this frivolity, and confess the fact as it stands; if any righteousness which works are supposed to possess depends on justification by faith, this doctrine is not only not impaired, but on the contrary confirmed, its power being thereby more brightly displayed. Nor let us suppose, that after free justification works are commended, as if they afterwards succeeded to the office of justifying, or shared the office with faith. For did not justification by faith always remain entire, the impurity of works would be disclosed. There is nothing absurd in the doctrine, that though man is justified by faith, he is himself not only not righteous, but the righteousness attributed to his works is beyond their own deserts.

10. In this way we can admit not only that there is a partial righteousness in works (as our adversaries maintain), but that they are approved by God as if they were absolutely perfect. If we remember on what foundation this is rested, every difficulty will be solved. The first time when a work begins to be acceptable is when it is received with pardon. And whence pardon, but just because God looks upon us and all that belongs to us as in Christ? Therefore, as we ourselves when ingrafted into Christ appear righteous before God, because our iniquities are covered with his innocence; so our works are, and are deemed righteous, because every thing otherwise defective in them being buried by the purity of Christ is not imputed. Thus we may justly say, that not only ourselves, but our works also, are justified by faith alone. Now, if that righteousness of works, whatever it be, depends on faith and free justification, and is produced by it, it ought to be included under it and, so to speak, made subordinate to it, as the effect to its cause; so far is it from being entitled to be set up to impair or destroy the doctrine of justification. Thus Paul, to prove that our blessedness depends not on our works, but on the mercy of God, makes special use of the words of David, ""Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered;"" ""Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity."" Should any one here obtrude the numberless passages in which blessedness seems to be attributed to works, as, ""Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord;"" ""He that has mercy on the poor, happy is he;"" ""Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,"" and ""that endureth temptation;"" ""Blessed are they that keep judgment,"" that are ""pure in heart,"" ""meek,"" ""merciful,"" &c., they cannot make out that Paul's doctrine is not true. For seeing that the qualities thus extolled never all so exist in man as to obtain for him the approbation of God, it follows, that man is always miserable until he is exempted from misery by the pardon of his sins. Since, then, all the kinds of blessedness extolled in the Scripture are vain so that man derives no benefit from them until he obtains blessedness by the forgiveness of sins, a forgiveness which makes way for them, it follows that this is not only the chief and highest, but the only blessedness, unless you are prepared to maintain that it is impaired by things which owe their entire existence to it. There is much less to trouble us in the name of righteous which is usually given to believers. I admit that they are so called from the holiness of their lives, but as they rather exert themselves in the study of righteousness than fulfill righteousness itself, any degree of it which they possess must yield to justification by faith, to which it is owing that it is what it is.

11. But they say that we have a still more serious business with James, who in express terms opposes us. For he asks, ""Was not Abraham our father justified by works?"" and adds ""You see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only,"" (James 2:21, 24). What then?  Will they engage Paul in a quarrel with James? If they hold James to be a servant of Christ, his sentiments must be understood as not dissenting from Christ speaking by the mouth of Paul. By the mouth of Paul the Spirit declares that Abraham obtained justification by faith, not by works; we also teach that all are justified by faith without the works of the law. By James the same Spirit declares that both Abraham's justification and ours consists of works, and not of faith only. It is certain that the Spirit cannot be at variance with himself. Where, then, will be the agreement? It is enough for our opponents, provided they can tear up that justification by faith which we regard as fixed by the deepest roots: to restore peace to the conscience is to them a matter of no great concern. Hence you may see, that though they indeed carp at the doctrine of justification by faith, they meanwhile point out no goal of righteousness at which the conscience may rest.  Let them triumph then as they will, so long as the only victory they can boast of is, that they have deprived righteousness of all its certainty. This miserable victory they will indeed obtain when the light of truth is extinguished, and the Lord permits them to darken it with their lies. But wherever the truth of God stands they cannot prevail. I deny, then, that the passage of James which they are constantly holding up before us as if it were the shield of Achilles, gives them the slightest countenance. To make this plain, let us first attend to the scope of the Apostle, and then show wherein their hallucination consists. As at that time (and the evil has existed in the Church ever since) there were many who, while they gave manifest proof of their infidelity, by neglecting and omitting all the works peculiar to believers, ceased not falsely to glory in the name of faith, James here dissipates their vain confidence. His intention therefore is, not to derogate in any degree from the power of true faith, but to show how absurdly these triflers laid claim only to the empty name, and resting satisfied with it, felt secure in unrestrained indulgence in vice. This state of matters being understood, it will be easy to see where the error of our opponents lies. They fall into a double paralogism, the one in the term faith, the other in the term justifying. The Apostle, in giving the name of faith to an empty opinion altogether differing from true faith, makes a concession which derogates in no respect from his case. This he demonstrates at the outset by the words, ""What does it profit, my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not works?"" (James 2:14). He says not, ""If a man have faith without works,"" but ""if he say that he has."" This becomes still clearer when a little after he derides this faith as worse than that of devils, and at last when he calls it ""dead."" You may easily ascertain his meaning by the explanation, ""Thou believest that there is one God."" Surely if all which is contained in that faith is a belief in the existence of God, there is no wonder that it does not justify. The denial of such a power to it cannot be supposed to derogate in any degree from Christian faith, which is of a very different description. For how does true faith justify unless by uniting us to Christ, so that being made one with him, we may be admitted to a participation in his righteousness? It does not justify because it forms an idea of the divine existence, but because it reclines with confidence on the divine mercy.

12. We have not made good our point until we dispose of the other paralogism: since James places a part of justification in works. If you would make James consistent with the other Scriptures and with himself, you must give the word justify, as used by him, a different meaning from what it has with Paul. In the sense of Paul we are said to be justified when the remembrance of our unrighteousness is obliterated and we are counted righteous. Had James had the same meaning it would have been absurd for him to quote the words of Moses, ""Abraham believed God,"" &c. The context runs thus: ""Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?  And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness."" If it is absurd to say that the effect was prior to its cause, either Moses falsely declares in that passage that Abraham's faith was imputed for righteousness or Abraham, by his obedience in offering up Isaac, did not merit righteousness. Before the existence of Ishmael, who was a grown youth at the birth of Isaac, Abraham was justified by his faith. How thee can we say that he obtained justification by an obedience which followed long after? Wherefore, either James erroneously inverts the proper order (this it were impious to suppose), or he meant not to say that he was justified, as if he deserved to be deemed just. What then? It appears certain that he is speaking of the manifestation, not of the imputation of righteousness, as if he had said, Those who are justified by true faith prove their justification by obedience and good works, not by a bare and imaginary semblance of faith. In one word, he is not discussing the mode of justification, but requiring that the justification of believers shall be operative. And as Paul contends that men are justified without the aid of works, so James will not allow any to be regarded as justified who are destitute of good works.  Due attention to the scope will thus disentangle every doubt; for the error of our opponents lies chiefly in this, that they think James is defining the mode of justification, whereas his only object is to destroy the depraved security of those who vainly pretended faith as an excuse for their contempt of good works. Therefore, let them twist the words of James as they may, they will never extract out of them more than the two propositions: That an empty phantom of faith does not justify, and that the believer, not contented with such an imagination, manifests his justification by good works.

13. They gain nothing by quoting from Paul to the same effect, that ""not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified,"" (Rom. 2:13). I am unwilling to evade the difficulty by the solution of Ambrose, that Paul spoke thus because faith in Christ is the fulfillment of the law. This I regard as a mere subterfuge, and one too for which there is no occasion, as the explanation is perfectly obvious. The Apostle's object is to suppress the absurd confidence of the Jews who gave out that they alone had a knowledge of the law, though at the very time they where its greatest despisers. That they might not plume themselves so much on a bare acquaintance with the law, he reminds them that when justification is sought by the law, the thing required is not the knowledge but the observance of it. We certainly mean not to dispute that the righteousness of the law consists in works, and not only so, but that justification consists in the dignity and merits of works. But this proves not that we are justified by works unless they can produce some one who has fulfilled the law. That Paul had no other meaning is abundantly obvious from the context. After charging Jews and Gentiles in common with unrighteousness, he descends to particulars and says, that ""as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law,"" referring to the Gentiles, and that ""as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law,"" referring to the Jews. Moreover, as they, winking at their transgressions, boasted merely of the law, he adds most appropriately, that the law was passed with the view of justifying not those who only heard it, but those only who obeyed it; as if he had said, Do you seek righteousness in the law? do not bring forward the mere hearing of it, which is in itself of little weight, but bring works by which you may show that the law has not been given to you in vain. Since in these they were all deficient, it followed that they had no ground of boasting in the law. Paul's meaning, therefore, rather leads to an opposite argument. The righteousness of the law consists in the perfection of works; but no man can boast of fulfilling the law by works, and, therefore, there is no righteousness by the law.

14. They now betake themselves to those passages in which believers boldly submit their righteousness to the judgment of God, and wish to be judged accordingly; as in the following passages: ""Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me."" Again, ""Hear the right, O Lord;"" ""Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing."" Again ""The Lord regarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me. For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God."" ""I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity."" Again, ""Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity;"" ""I have not sat with vain persons; neither will I go in with dissemblers;"" ""Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men; in whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity."" I have already spoken of the confidence which the saints seem to derive simply from works. The passages now quoted will not occasion much difficulty, if we attend to their peri'stasis, their connection, or (as it is commonly called) special circumstances. These are of two kinds; for those who use them have no wish that their whole life should be brought to trial, so that they may be acquitted or condemned according to its tenor; all they wish is, that a decision should be given on the particular case; and even here the righteousness which they claim is not with reference to the divine perfection, but only by comparison with the wicked and profane. When the question relates to justification, the thing required is not that the individual have a good ground of acquittal in regard to some particular matter, but that his whole life be in accordance with righteousness. But when the saints implore the divine justice in vindication of their innocence, they do not present themselves as free from fault, and in every respect blameless but while placing their confidence of salvation in the divine goodness only, and trusting that he will vindicate his poor when they are afflicted contrary to justice and equity, they truly commit to him the cause in which the innocent are oppressed. And when they sist themselves with their adversaries at the tribunal of God, they pretend not to an innocence corresponding to the divine purity were inquiry strictly made, but knowing that in comparison of the malice, dishonesty, craft, and iniquity of their enemies, their sincerity justice, simplicity, and purity, are ascertained and approved by God, they dread not to call upon him to judge between them. Thus when David said to Saul, ""The Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness,"" (1 Sam. 26:23), he meant not that the Lord should examine and reward every one according to his deserts, but he took the Lord to witness how great his innocence was in comparison of Saul's injustice. Paul, too, when he indulges in the boast, ""Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward,"" (2 Cor. 1:12), means not to call for the scrutiny of God, but compelled by the calumnies of the wicked he appeals, in contradiction of all their slanders, to his faith and probity, which he knew that God had indulgently accepted. For we see how he elsewhere says, ""I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified,"" (1 Cor. 4:4); in other words, he was aware that the divine judgment far transcended the blind estimate of man. Therefore, however believers may, in defending their integrity against the hypocrisy of the ungodly, appeal to God as their witness and judge, still when the question is with God alone, they all with one mouth exclaim, ""If thou, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"" Again, ""Enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified."" Distrusting their own words, they gladly exclaim, ""Thy loving-kindness is better than life,"" (Ps. 130:3; 143:2; 63:3).

15. There are other passages not unlike those quoted above, at which some may still demur. Solomon says, ""The just man walketh in his integrity,"" (Prov. 20:7). Again, ""In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death,"" (Prov. 12:28). For this reason Ezekiel says, He that ""has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live,"" (Ezek.  18:9, 21; 23:15). None of these declarations do we deny or obscure. But let one of the sons of Adam come forward with such integrity. If there is none, they must perish from the presence of God, or retake themselves to the asylum of mercy. Still we deny not that the integrity of believers, though partial and imperfect, is a step to immortality.  How so, but just that the works of those whom the Lord has assumed into the covenant of grace, he tries not by their merit, but embraces with paternal indulgence. By this we understand not with the Schoolmen, that works derive their value from accepting grace. For their meaning is, that works otherwise unfit to obtain salvation in terms of law, are made fit for such a purpose by the divine acceptance. On the other hand, I maintain that these works being sullied both by other transgressions and by their own deficiencies, have no other value than this, that the Lord indulgently pardons them; in other words, that the righteousness which he bestows on man is gratuitous. Here they unseasonably obtrude those passages in which the Apostle prays for all perfection to believers, ""To the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father,"" (1 Thess. 3:13, and elsewhere). These words were strongly urged by the Celestines of old, in maintaining the perfection of holiness in the present life. To this we deem it sufficient briefly to reply with Augustine, that the goal to which all the pious ought to aspire is, to appear in the presence of God without spot and blemish; but as the course of the present life is at best nothing more than progress, we shall never reach the goal until we have laid aside the body of sin, and been completely united to the Lord. If any one choose to give the name of perfection to the saints, I shall not obstinately quarrel with him, provided he defines this perfection in the words of Augustine, ""When we speak of the perfect virtue of the saints, part of this perfection consists in the recognition of our imperfection both in truth and in humility,"" (August. ad Bonif. lib. 3, c. 7).",John Calvin,1965,"[66, 71, 72, 79, 89, 94, 94]",7
448,Is This What I Get For Loving You?,"There's been a lot of talk around
That you've been seen with a certain party

449,Lip Sync (To The Tongue Twisters),"Sister midnight comes blaspheming
Screaming in the keys of faith and fear
Unentwining our spines twists me to kneeling...
Spilling like the moonlight on her glistening rear

Defiled at heart
In this perfect hell
Under red leaves bleeding
Over scaled chateau we fell
To demonocracy
Where neither Adam or Eve
Conceived of such iniquities
From pleasure or pain
Or the razor's edge inbetween
Thou art my seventh heaven burning
Going down as with the sun...

Within like a river fluids moves a torrent
Bound to please
On denierred knees
In any wicked way
That her whims may warrant

I hang on every verb
Every dirty word
Interred
In her pornoglossa...

Christlike, whipped and weak
Painted nails driven through the meek
Yet in obituary
My dreams still weep
Of dark blood and fucking thee

Thou art seventh heaven burning
Going down as with the day
Baring lunar curvature
Like canvas for a lick of pain

Writhing like a viper
Deep inside her Eden
Forbidden to eat
I kiss leylines to her feet
Then baiting wrath
I steal a path
Back to the fruits of her womb

Back to the crack of her tomb...

Her roseate sliver
Quivers with snuff appeal
The torque of her hips
Lip-sync me in for the kill
Tongue-tied, tightrope and spread like disease
I drain the cup of this Miss Sire
Her water into wine for me

Thou art my seventh angel squirming
'Neath the forked tongue of the beast
Arching toward the fabled
Like a sculptured nymph seeking base relief...

Whilst the world outside
(A wood of suicide)
Would die for this release
Our slow orgasmic fuses greet...

By night and by candle
At each other's throat
In a slick drift of red
Setting god's teeth on edge
We were as wolves preying inside the fold
Of a slaughtered lamb throw
On a four poster bed...

Succulent, Succubus

Laid without rest
In the dead of the night
Succulent, Succubus

In thy arms
And thy wetness
On glossed lips I taste
Conspiracies, secrecies, sorceries laced
With thick unguent rum
Black-rayed suns and Autumn
Always in season for our nightfall from grace

Gorge upon my seed
Starved Persephone
Succulent, Succubus
Succor me
That I might keep
Thee with me in Hades

Fucking up all I do

Like Jesus played letter
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep
But if you could just write me out
To neverless wonder, happy will I become
Be true that this is no option
So with sin, I condemn you
Demon play, demon out

Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

It's almost tomorrow, for here comes the sun
But still I am hoping that tomorrow won't come

It's almost tomorrow, but what can I do
Your kisses all tell me that your love is untrue
I'll love you forever, till stars cease to shine
And hope someday darling, that you'll always be mine",Jo Stafford,1965,"[93, 94, 94]",3
462,Tears Keep On Falling,"[Intro: B-Mike]
I need you to listen
Think, before you make that decision

[Verse 1: B-Mike]
You see I once knew a girl
Perfect as all hell
Happy and all swell, 'till the day that it all fell
But, you see one day her friends had asked her to come with them
A party filled with drinking and everything except wisdom, but listen
You see she said ""nope, I need to study,""
But her friends were like ""c'mon just have a night with all your buddies
It's totally a Saturday so come with everybody
All the alcohol you want and every guy there is a hottie.""
""Alright"" was her response, 'till not after very long it was drinks and puffing bongs
Until she is barely conscious
She meets a guy who keeps winking with his eye
Wants to get between her thighs
But it's clear he has no conscience
But soon they start kissing, and they don't have a rubber
She tells him ""no stop it,"" he says ""chill, I got it covered.""
A couple weeks later every morning felt like death
And at the Doc's it's positive up on the pregnancy test
She said

[Hook: B-Mike]
I feel you kicking, little angel
Don't worry 'bout the sorrow
Cause Mummy's gonna be right here until you see tomorrow
I feel your life in my stomach
I promise I'll protect it cause nobody comes above it
And though your daddy wants to take your life away
You should know I'll never let him, cause I tell him everyday
""You see this life in my stomach, regardless if you help me as a father
I'mma love it.""

[Verse 2: B-Mike]
She's been thinking for a while with these thoughts in her head
Feeling nervous, is it worth it? Should I press the eject?
It was perfect, now I'm worthless
I'm just feeling upset
Is it right to take a life, or something I will regret?
She tells her mother ""I'm a wreck, and I'm a pregnant adolescent.""
Her mother says ""how could you never think to use protection?
It's practical to see you need to actually believe
Your actions could be worse like contracting a disease.""
The tears keep on falling, thinking 'what do I say?'
Then her mother holds her closely, tells her ""it will be okay
But you need to think quickly about making a decision
Do you want to be a mother or go through with the incision?""
She said ""you won't believe it, this baby I'mma keep it
But promise for the moment we can keep it a big secret.""
Her mother leans forward, kissed her on the head
And then they looked down at her tummy, here's the words that she said

[Hook: B-Mike]
I feel you kicking, little angel
Don't worry 'bout the sorrow
Cause Mummy's gonna be right here until you see tomorrow
I feel your life in my stomach
I promise I'll protect it cause nobody comes above it
And though your daddy wants to take your life away
You should know I'll never let him, cause I tell him everyday
""You see this life in my stomach, regardless if you help me as a father
I'mma love it.""

[Verse 3: B-Mike]
It's 8 months later, a knock is at the door
It's the father of her child and he's looking so unsure
She's taking him to court cause he refuses child support
Then he says to her ""you need to give this baby an abort.""
You see he's got a girlfriend and he's clear that she said
'If he's gonna be a father then it's over instead.'
But you see it's way too late because she's two weeks from the cradle
He said he hates her child, and then she pushed him in the table
He looks at her and says to her
""Oh, now you've really done it!""
Kicks her in the stomach, on the floor she plummets
The feeling is so sickening, tears start kicking in
Looks below her stomach, sees the blood start trickling
Crawling to the phone, he's angry looking savage
The blood is dripping out, something like a miscarriage
Pulls her by her hair, she can barely defend
Says ""good bye little kiddie.""
Then he kicks her again!

[Hook: B-Mike]
I feel you kicking, little angel
Don't worry 'bout the sorrow
Cause Mummy's gonna be right here until you see tomorrow
I feel your life in my stomach
I promise I'll protect it cause nobody comes above it
And though your daddy wants to take your life away
You should know I'll never let him, cause I tell him everyday
""You see this life in my stomach, regardless if you help me as a father
I'mma love it.""",B-Mike,1965,"[96, 98, 100]",3

So come with me dear
The halogen hum hurts my ears
Swim in the spring
We could be free

'Cause I know a place we could go
No one has been there, and no one will know
There it is quiet, forget the violence
You've tried so hard to ignore

Oh, I know a place we could go
Unpack our bags and we'll call it a home
The sea will sing our minds to sleep
I know a place we could go

And once we get there we could stay
An old shaky house, our lives would be made
And I don't know all the answers
But you look like December
There we could stay

I'm tired of fear
Grasping for safe, familiar
You are like me, oh, could we leave?

'Cause I know a place we could go
Far from the highways, far from that home
Seep in the silence, safe in our minds that
We try so hard to control

Oh, I know a place we could go
No one will notice once we are gone
Up in the trees, laugh on the beach
I know a place we could go

Can we go home?

'Cause I know a place we could go
Deep in the forest, out of the storm
Our souls could be freed of the disease
That everyone tried to destroy

No one has been there, no one will know
The sea will sing our minds to sleep

Mona, fine young sugar comin out of Arizona
5 ft. 6 straight thick with a switch
And a set of them juicy-ass lips (Mmh...)
Kinky, just like me
She can take a straight gee
And put him down for the count 1, 2, 3
Needless to say I was kickin it
Cause I know when I'm the only one gettin it
But - ooh, things change when you don't maintain
The same game you got her with, mayn
Flew back home, and I was slippin
Cause as soon as I left, another brother starts spittin
Throwin drag about wantin a family
Tryin to front because he wanna be manly
Tellin my girl how I'm playin the field
Boy, you'se a jake for real
Now a player I like, but you know I can't stand no snitch
Tryin to front like he rich
Done shot your credit, cause you bought you a new E

You paid a lotta money just to grab her

Baby girl's through, so I need somethin new
You can't keep a good mack down

5'9"" with dimples
Caramel skin, straight fine, hella tight, no pimples
Thinkin my game was concrete
But I gotta watch for them other entertainers and athletes
Especially the ones who wanna settle down
Cause they'll beg and drink out your shoes and get they nose brown
Just the kinda man you wanted, ain't it, honey?
A big buff dumb-ass fool with hella money
Down to spend till his knees bend
Then the athlete's broke and his girl's in the wind
And my girl gets mad, cause I never spend time like I'm s'posed to
Plus I'm a boaster
Shaggin up too damn quick, now she's lookin for a sugar daddy
Just to get a '96 Caddy
A big truck she found
You young scrub on the bench for the Cleveland Browns
He never had nothin, thicker than a cheerleader
Now he got juice, so he eats her
And treats her to a big wad of cash
Too weak, so she left his ass

Her name is Teresa
She was freakier than me, but I figured I could please her
She had the long braids
Chocolate sister, loved to cuff men like slaves
Arrived at the house at last
Seen two shades of lipstick on the same wine glass
Provocative artwork around me
Four pink slippers on the floor surround me
One pair's for her, the other pair's for who?
Plus she only lives in a one bedroom

My love for you just grows and grows

I support peace and love and lets put this world back together. stop the violence I have had enough i'm takinga stand and you should too. its alright to educate kids about the past but we need to also tell them that sometimes what people say hjave different meanings or context. stop bullying put more jobs in gary Indiana , Detroit Michigan , new orlean lousiana so we all can have jobs and work not enough jobs for the people in America so time for triliionaire , billionaires, and millionaires to spend some money back on the united state of America and our kids stop with the greed and the nee to be the one in power and we could all share power the world I pray to god to bless us with things we can change and to the things we can't let god jesus Christ deal with it forever and ever amen 1tim = 2pac be yourself you can't be someone else put yourself in there shoes and then throw stones cause I bet like jesus said we all have sinned now is time to ask for forgivness and I bet god will make it done already",1Tim,1965,"[49, 40, 42, 48, 50, 60, 74, 77, 85]",9

House of Blues and Cotilions
We sang in the sun
And out on the street
Southwest to New England
Australia and New Zealand
Although we’ve seen them
The picture’s not complete
We’d love to play in the Aloha State
That’s one place we can’t wait to see
We’ve played all over and it’s really been great
But up till now we’ve never played in Hawaii
We’ve played Hobart and Hershey
Hallandale and Hadley
We’ve played Hollywood
And Hillsboro too
Hyannis and Hartford
Halifax and Hamburg
Even in New Hampshire
But there’s still something left to do
We’d love to play in the Aloha State
That’s one thing on which we all agree
It’s just a short hop from the Golden Gate
Over the ocean and off, to where we can see
All of the palm trees swayin’
In tropical breezes on white sandy beaches
The start of our Hawaiian fantasy
We’ve been treated like big stars
Rode around in some big cars
We’ve no reason to be cryin’ the blues
We got all that we asked for
Not looking for much more
Maybe on the next tour
That would be good news
If we could play in the Aloha State
That’s one place we can’t wait to see
We’ve played all over and it’s really been great
But up till now we’ve never played in Hawaii
Over the ocean and off, to where we can see
All of the palm trees swayin’
In tropical breezes on white sandy beaches
And colorful fish in the sea
We could be playin’ while hula girls sway
And it would be, the way we always dreamed it
Beautiful blue skies, we’d be in paradise

What do you want with me?

What do you want with me?

You only want to break us up
And use me for a while
Then you'll leave me cryin'
I've heard it all before
Your other boys have told me
What do you want with me?

The love I've got
Is something else again
She's loving, she's true
Let me tell you, she's not a bit like you
And I'm asking you a question

What do you want with me?
Why don't you let me be?

482,Georgie Porgie,"[Hook]
Listen up money or should I say honey
Listen up money or should I say honey

[Phife]
In the beginning there was Adam and Eve
But some try to make it look like Adam and Steve
Like Georgie, why can't money find a honey
I couldn't believe when I found out he was funny
You know fierce with just his right ear pierced
I couldn't hack it, I knew this brother for years
Walking in the ville with them long dreadlocks
But on the DL, getting done up the butt box
Oh my God how gross can one be
Well anyway, better him than me
Used to be down with the crew and had the girls that were def
Instead of staying to the right, he fell off to the left
So Lord J being that you go next
Pull the rest of his card cause I'm vexed

[Lord Jamar]
My man George got a germ that's ill
Suffering from terminal scag
But never ever getting caught walking like a fag
That's not his bag cause the plague was afraid to parade in drag
So instead he played the DL, brothers get jel
Cause honey's on his dick but money won't swell
He'd rather call Manuel for a little duel
Have a swordfight with tools
He's wounded and I can't understand
Why a man would want to be a weak cipher man
I thought the plan was to be hard as a rock
Not riding a jock, sucking on a cock

[Hook x2]

[Grand Puba]
My man George I thought he was on base
Find out later that he was a closet case
Woah woah he's a sweet thing
George was down with the titty titty bang bang
Now George swung with gays, just the way he sways
Even fooled around with his mom's lingerie
Come get it girl, something fierce was his line
Even wore a dress and on his face he had swine
He cipher monkey cipher, you fucking faggot
Couldn't wait for gay parade so you can drag it
George used to flip, went from hitting skins to sucking nigga's dick
George better get a grip

[Sadat X]
Now Georgie used to run with the ill brothers
Kids who liked to rob mothers, and do a bunch of crazy things
He had the ladies, a baby, a shiny black .380
That he always kept tucked and filled with the slugs
Now watch how money bugs
Weight fell it's hard to tell but believe me George has slid
Coming out the closet was the dress that he hid
From the boys when we was over there I seen it out the corner of my eye
I said damn Georgie George signify
The whole crew seen it now the whole block knows
That George gets his kicks from wearing Wisdom's clothes

[Q-Tip]
Now Georgie Porgie pudding pie
What made you choose the path of the gays, oh why
Ain't got no reason, to hell with alibis
Won't play basketball cause your nails ain't dry
Call me homophobic but I know it and you know it
You're filthy and funny to the utmost exponent
Never will I do that, disrespect my mommy
So run and hide your salami
Used to, didn't you, used to be my man
Instead of shaking, you're dragging your hand
Yes it's the Abstract the info provider
Here's your new name - the rump rider

Gotta have your love

Since you've been gone
Leaving me lonely
Something inside of me died

You closed the door
Living me lonely
While I just broke down and cried

We used to wake up together
Remembering moments of last night
This morning things were not the same
I live with memories now
From back when everything was right
Pictures of you won't set me free

I dream everyday
Hoping and praying
You'll be back here beside me

Gotta have your love
Gotta have your love

Since you've been gone
Leaving me lonely
Something inside of me died

We used to cuddle and kiss
When days were turning and night was cool
That's not the way my nights are now

You are dancing with somebody else now
Underneath another moon
Pictures of you won't set me free

Gotta have your love
Gotta have your love

Every minute and every hours
And thinking of you
Praying for your loving

I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

486,When The Ship Comes In,"Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in

And the sea will split
And the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the waves will pound
And the mornin' will be a-breakin'

The fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

And they'll raise their hands
Sayin', ""We'll meet all your demands""
But we'll shout from the bow, ""Your days are numbered""
And like Pharoah's tribe
They'll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered",Bob Dylan,1965,"[91, 94, 98]",3

493,Subterranean Homesick Blues,"[Verse 1]
Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10

[Verse 2]
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says the many say
They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A.""
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

[Verse 3]
Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters

[Verse 4]
Oh, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed
Get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

If I'd have let my walls come down?

509,Crazy Downtown,"Mommy and Dad are never nervous or mad
When you teenagers go downtown
Daddy and Mom just stay at home and be calm
And watch the late late show, uptown
'Cause when you kids are gone we get to spend some time alone here
That's our only chance to use the bathtub or the phone here
When you're away
Besides, we're stuck where we are
Because you kids took our money, you kids took our car and went
Downtown, where can you possibly
Downtown, it's twenty after three
Downtown, what do you mean by, ""Let's frug""?

You don't come home till 4 AM cause you're roaming
In the streets somewhere, downtown
We would feel swell if only someone would tell us
What goes on down there, downtown
But every time we ask you what you're doing after dark there
You just say that you were frugging to Petula Clark there
That's what I mean
So, kids, give your folks a break
Because you're driving us crazy, we sit here all night and take
Milltown, swallowing pills so we'll
Calm down, counting the hours you're
Downtown, you and your frug and your slop

While we're lying there we try to watch the television
Then you call us up and say you've had a slight collision
There goes the car
Besides that you've been arrested
So we've got to get up, and we've got to get dressed and go
Downtown, borrow a car and go
Downtown, that's where you are, you finks
Downtown, wait 'till I get you kids home

(Spoken) There'll be no more frugging, no swim, no jerk, no mashed potato, no slop! And you know what else? You're gonna stay home tonight, and your mother and I are going downtown and we're going to dance the tango, and the waltz, and the foxtrot, and we're gonna do the bunny hop. That's a nice dance! And there'll be no more frugging! Is that quite clear? NO MORE FRUGGING!",Allan Sherman,1965,"[48, 40, 41, 44, 49, 54, 68, 90]",8
510,Goodbye My Lover Goodbye,"Hear the wind sing a sad, old song

Goodbye my love goodbye
Goodbye and au revoir
As long as you remember me
I'll never be too far

Goodbye my love goodbye
I always will be true
So hold me in your dreams
'till I come back to you

See the stars in the skies above
They'll shine wherever I may roam
I will pray every lonely night
That soon they'll guide me home

Goodbye my love goodbye
Goodbye and au revoir
As long as you remember me
I'll never be too far

Goodbye my love goodbye
I always will be true
So hold me in your dreams

511,Think Of The Good Times,"You were the only one I could see
Now that we're through, if you think of me
Think of the good times, only the good times
Walks in the rain, warm summer nights
Remember the kisses and not just the fights

One foolish moment drove us apart
If there's a spark still left in your heart
Think of the good times, only the good times
You in my arms, two hearts like one
Don't tell me that it is over and done

Once we promised we'd love forever (way back then)
Can't we let these wonderful memories bring us together again

If you'll admit you think of me yet
Darlin' come back, forgive and forget
Think of the good times, we'll only have good times
Your lips on mine (where they belong)
Where they belong
But this time we won't let our good times go wrong

We'll think of the good times, only the good times
Yeah, we'll think of the good times, only the good times
Oh, we'll think of the good times, only the good times",Jay and the Americans,1965,"[57, 60, 60, 72, 77, 83, 92, 94]",8

I don't care if they can fly

Now somebody's girl is in my mansion
Shakin that ass to this
And somebody's girl is in my hot tub
Drinkin that glass of Crist'
And somebody's girl is in my bedroom
And man she's a superfreak
And somebody's girl is leavin my crib
Now on to the next booty

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Ummmmmmmmm, I don't mean no harm
But your boy got the magic stick, the Don Juan
Bishop, chicks'll disappear in thin air
Like mist or some shit like this I swear
I take handcuffs off missus, I pick locks wicked
I catch your eye 'cause my tick-tock's frigid
My necklace glisten, all reckless chicks is
Eyeballin', yeah, and I caught 'em like perfect pitches
Call me Mike Piazza
Once I get 'em in, my fly casa
It's hot tubs, heated pools and no rules
Call your old dude and tell him he old news
Tell that fella you feel like Cinderella
With both shoes and it's almost two
Fuck a storybook endin', we bendin' the rules
This is somebody's girl part two, now move

[Hook]

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Uhh, let me at it
Somebody's girl is sittin in my lap
Whisper two words and we both break out
My Maybach seats is just as big as a couch
Not the same girl now that the mic's at your mouth
Oh that's gettin nasty, let's get naughty
Rollin around like a fo'-wheel after party
We stop at a red light, there go your girls an' 'em
Now we got the green light, driver follow them (let's go)
You're rotatin' with a guy that spend money like the world spin 'round
First guy to ever put the singin rap down
Say the name Kells and these chicks spellbound
Because these chicks know I put the 12 Play down
I gotta have it, I just can't stop limpin'
Maybe because I just can't stop pimpin'
No matter what I do, I can't stop leanin'
When the fresh Prada's on and the sun is shinin'
Girls it's your boyfriend
With that remix that keeps you clubbin'
This collabo crack got you fiendin
The industry kings and the rest is dreamin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
The moral of the tale, if you love your tail
Treat her well, keep her 'way from Hov' and Kel'
Because we can't stop pimpin
We put it on her 'til she can't stop limpin
She'll be a goner, you can play tough guy on the corner

[Куплет 1]

Мы открыли дверь
Ты не сомневаешься, кто говорит за Пермь теперь
Теперь они базарят обо мне
Но я перевожу каждое их слово в новый куплет
И ты знаешь: никакого коллаба с фальшивками
Мы кидаем в гримерке пожитки
Весь персонал обтёк еще на чеке
Знаешь, меня тоже плющит с собственной читки
Есть новый проц с касс, где спать-срать
Паркплац или плацкарт
Лететь, ехать, Як, «Боинг», «Гетц», «Логан» старый
Эскорт или S-класс (Дайджест)
Они все в хлам, я давно не спал, гемоглобин вниз
Но я ловлю такс, и я готов взять этого журавля и нахуй твоих синиц

[Бридж]
На инструментале, как Бог
Да, в этом бокале любовь
За вот этот новый айфон
Ёб её под новый альбом
Время на поспать — это на кон
Снова развожу этот огонь
Хочешь — ори, хочешь — сломай себе ногти
Только не делай следов

[Предприпев]
Ну, и как я могу не получить доступ?
Как-как я могу не получить доступ?

И никакой пощады, хочу порно-оскар

Не могу поверить, что я никому не могу поверить
Мой старый характер убит, а мой внутренний мир
Этот корабль упёрся в берег (god-damn!)
У этого бита нет сердца, у микрофона нет на меня планов
Сзади догорает мост, а рядом никого, и только твои ноги тебя не обманут
Папа говорит: «Если сумеешь поменять что-то сам в этой музыке, тогда делай
Ведь это все, что ты можешь, это тебя не покинет, это тебе дали гены»
Они говорят, что я selfish, но заливают со мной в соцсети селфи
Потом они желают нам упасть вниз, но я будто бы собрал каждый клевер с логотипа Celtics

(Убей их)
Я могу либо работать, убивая новый бит, либо до ебанного талого тусить
Это не было, нет и не будет для меня дело выбора

Like my heart's sprung a big leak
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now you might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

One day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you'd gone from me
There's aching and pain in my heart
For the day was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches

Used to, but he quit it

He don't comb his hair like he did before
He don't wear those dirty old black boots no more

But he's not the same
There's something about his kisses that tells me he's changed
I know there's something missing inside
(Tell me more)
Something died

His heart, his heart is out in the streets

He grew up on the sidewalk, streetlights shining above
He grew up with no one to love

He grew up on the sidewalk, he grew up running free
He grew up and then he met me

He don't hang around with the gang no more
Gee, he doesn't smile like he did before

[Break

I wish I didn't care
I wish I'd never met him

529,When I'm Gone,"[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing

I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said, ""What you need is Love Potion Number 9""

[Verse 3]
She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said, ""I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink""
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like Indian ink

I saw a quiet man who had a gentle way
A way that caught me in its glowing spell

Why did I want you?
What could you offer me?
A love to last a life time through
And when I lost my heart so many years ago
I lost it lovingly and willingly to you...
If I had to choose again
I would still choose you...",Barbra Streisand,1965,"[77, 84, 91, 93, 94]",5
536,All Of My Life,"[Verse 1]
All of my life, I've been searching
For the words to say how I feel
I'd spend my time thinking too much
And leave too little to say what I mean
But I try to understand the best I can
All of my life
All of my life, I've been saying sorry
For the things I know I should have done
All the things I could have said come back to me
Sometimes I wish that it had just begun
Seems I'm always that little too late
All of my life


[Chorus]
Set 'em up, I'll take a drink with you
Pull up a chair, I think I'll stay
Set 'em up, cos I'm going nowhere
There's too much I need to remember, and there's too much I need to say

[Verse 2]
All of my life, I've been looking
But it's hard to find the way
Just reaching past the goal in front of me
While what's important just slips away
And it doesn't come back, but I'll be looking
All of my life

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All of my life, there have been regrets
That I didn't do all I could
Playing records upstairs, while he watched TV
I didn't spend the time I should
And that's a memory I will live with
All of my life",Phil Collins,1965,"[78, 71, 72, 78, 81, 92]",6
537,I Gotta Woman (Part One),"[Verse 1]
There's two things I know for sure
She was sent here from heaven
And she's daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus
And I close my eyes
And I thank god for all of the joy in my life
Oh, but most of all

[Chorus]
For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride""
""I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong
I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning
And butterfly kisses at night

[Verse 2]
Sweet 16 today
She's looking like her mama
A little more everyday
One part woman, the other part girl
To perfume and make-up
From ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world
But I remember

[Chorus]
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
""You know how much I love you, Daddy, but if you don't mind""
""I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time""
Oh with all that I've done wrong
I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning
And butterfly kisses at night

[Bridge]
All the precious time
Ohhh, like the wind, the years go by
Precious butterfly
Spread your wings and fly

[Verse 3]
She'll change her name today
She'll make a promise
And I'll give her away
Standing in the bride-room
Just staring at her
She asked me what I'm thinking
And I said ""I'm not sure""
""I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl""
And she leaned over

[Chorus]
Gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk me down the aisle, Daddy, it's just about time""
""Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy? Daddy, don't cry""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong
I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning
And butterfly kisses

[Outro]
I couldn't ask God for more, man this is what love is
I know I gotta let her go, but I'll always remember
Every hug in the morning
And butterfly kisses",Bob Carlisle,1965,"[79, 82, 88]",3
538,Chains Of Love,"Walk away slowly
You don't have to take this
In the spaces and between
Sadness on their faces

I can see the chains of love
The chains
Talking 'bout the chains of love
Can't take us away

Storms are brewing in your heart
I don't wanna waste it
Better to have tried it all
Least we got to taste it

Locked up in the chains of love
We change
Caught up in the chains of love
Can't take us away

Clouds moving over the house
I think about those days
Wish I had something to relax my mind
Send me off to heaven
I've got nothing but time

Lightning in the sky above
Blinking, see the traces
Everything you are to me
Is bigger than the spaces

Between us in the chains of love
The chains
Locked up in the chains of love
Can't take us away

Can't take us away
Can't take us away
Can't take us away",Ryan Adams,1965,"[90, 90]",2
539,Sad Tomorrows,"[Verse 1]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
The rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And it's bound to forsake me

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can't find it

In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

[Verse 2]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
That does seen nothing but trouble baby
Paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hands

To the boy who makes slaves out of men

Thankyou very much, thankyou. No I'm not through, I'm just starting Jack! This surprised me too, boy! I ain't even got my shorts on backwards. Drink! Oh this is just a gag, I don't drink anymore. I freeze it now and I eat it like a popsicle. You just remember a drink never hurt nobody at all, just remember the great words of mister Joe E Lewis, he said ""you're not drunk if you can lay on the floor without holding on"". ""How would you know?""

Joe and I were over in my den one morning, swimming, and he mixed himself a peculiar drink. I looked down at him and said ""what you drinking down there, Joe?"". And he looked down at me, and he said ""Scotch and carrot juice"". I said ""Why?"", he said ""I get drunk, but I see good"". You know I wanna say one thing in all seriousness. I feel sorry for you people who don't drink. Cause when you wake up in the morning, that's as good as you're gonna feel all day!

Broke and bummy, dirty clothes and I got laughed at
People pay to see me now, I got the last laugh

No Louis bags, I packed my clothes in trash bags
Couple niggas in that cell and they countin' on me
Ice drippin' from my neck, like a fountain on me
I done did a bunch of shit, but I don't dwell on it
I just pray none of my niggas don't tell on me
My lifestyle, yeah, it come with the fame
Had to put the work in, 'cause it ain't come with the chain

I don't know Batman, but I was robbin' folks
Buy a brick and pour a six, I was tired of fours
Now my whips suicide, I had a fight with my doors
And all my bitches are in line, F&N hit his spine (Hear ye, hear ye)
I can't let a nigga Biggie me, I keep mines
I be on the road makin' plays, thankin' Allah
You be hittin' licks at Christmas for a da-da

Bucked the storm like a whore last night

We swear by the bread and the wine
More serious than any divine

Jewels, pearls and rhum in the hold
I'm the alligator-law chewin' on your bait
Ransackin loodin' you from stern to gate

Ah you make me sinn baby sinn baby

You were my fuckin' idol
But the truth always comes out

La da da da, la da da da, la da da da da da da)

Cause I promise (cause I promise)
And I mean it (and I mean it)
You don't ever wanna fuck with me

[Verse 1]
Yo
Let's fuckin' picture it, shit's about to blast the fan
I was only eight when mamma had to move to Amsterdam
And you approached her as a married man
So leave it up to me I'll cut your head off like the Taliban in Pakistan
I can't believe it, you're out here making stacks of cheese
And while I'm stuck here struggling I should make your ass a paraplegic
It's sad to see it, but dad you cheated
I swear to God if you come near me you'll get stomped on with my black Adidas'
You had me fooled for all those years with your lies
But now I see it's cause of you for all the tears in my eyes
And to my mother I apologise sincerely cause I
Was always blinded by betrayal that had appeared in disguise
Dad, it's so ridiculous, feeling silly I hit you up
For thinking you were really a parent it makes me sick as fuck
And don't be thinking that where I'm at is because of you
My fist is where your head will have a one way ticket to

Don't you ever (don't you ever)

And don't ever (and don't ever)
Try to call me (try to call me)
Twenty years was enough to see
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
And I mean it (and I mean it)
You don't ever wanna fuck with me

[Verse 2]
(What up dad?) Do you remember the birthdays you missed out?
(What up dad?) Do you remember breaking into our house?
(What up dad?) Do you remember buying food for yourself?
I was like six without a clue or a doubt, come on now tell me (what up dad?)
I wanna rip you up, no don't just think that's figurative
Living up in your villa while we suffered you told fibs to us
My bottom lip is up but don't assume that means we will forget what you just did to us
You're finished pops
Let it be told, the story how you chilled in mansions with gold
While we nearly got evicted to be ditched in the cold
Don't be tryin' to explain to us, the fact is you did it
The only time I put my hand to you is to smack you with it
And don't go saying that you're something that my step-dad will never be
He cherished me
Your psychopathic ass belongs in therapy
Or maybe I do, cause wanna know what I'd do?
I'd fuckin' severe your cerebrum singing la dee da doo
And don't you ever

[Hook]
Don't you ever (don't you ever)
Come near me (come near me)
Or even near to my family
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
I will kill you (I will kill you)

Try to call me (try to call me)
Twenty years was enough to see
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
And I mean it (and I mean it)
You don't ever wanna fuck with me

[Outro]
I can't believe this man
You were my fuckin' hero
Every time my mum tried to tell me the truth I was right there defending you
You ain't even call me on my birthday
And now I hear you put a price on my mother's head?
Fuck that - and fuck you too!
Cause since you took away my trust fund I'm stuck paying an interest on my student loan
So stay the fuck away from me
And don't you ever

[Hook]
Don't you ever (don't you ever)
Come near me (come near me)
Or even near to my family
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
I will kill you (I will kill you)
Cause you're dead as a dad to me
And don't ever (and don't ever)
Try to call me (try to call me)
Twenty years was enough to see
Cause I promise (cause I promise)
And I mean it (and I mean it)
You don't ever wanna fuck with me

Don't you ever
Come near me
Or even near to my family
Cause I promise
I will kill you
Cause you're dead as a dad to me",B-Mike,1965,"[95, 95, 98, 100]",4

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3]
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

[Bridge]
'Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone, regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

569,My Girl,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

[Verse 2]
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

570,Little Things,"[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam & Both]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I’ll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn and Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry & Harry and Louis & Harry and Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry and Niall & Harry]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge: Niall]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things",One Direction,1965,"[33, 16, 13, 18, 18, 23, 26, 31, 41, 58, 83, 91]",12
571,If I Ruled The World,"[Hook]
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 1]
If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not running for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the world ranked #1
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that the King was in town
As I arrived the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""
So I headed toward stage to make a speech
About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
People started flowing as they reached for my hand
I said, ""Thank you for bringing me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, so goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party""
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancing to the beat and entertaining: ""La-Di-Da-Di""
The music started ending, it was time for a speech
The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please for stopping this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and voters too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know hours passed I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothing in the world like being #1 king!

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (whoa whoa yeahhhhh)

{AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit}

[Verse 3]
Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rolling with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker MC's that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'ma rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love and happiness
In a world of peace and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's running the show
And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doing and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dying overseas
While you sucker mission politicians busting out Z's
Huh, 20 million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe
And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way
'Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day
So LISTEN UP world while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
The King who took my place was happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (yeahhhhh)

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (if I ruled the world)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)

572,I Must Be Seeing Things,"Isn't that my girl
And is that my best friend
Aren't they walking much to close together
And it don't look like their talkin about the weather

I must be seeing things
Oh no it can't be true
I must be hearing things
When I can hear her say to him
I want you, I need you, I love you

Looking through a tear
I can see him kissing her
I can feel my poor heart slowly breaking
I'll do anything if only I was mistakin'

I must be seeing things
Oh no it can't be true
I must be hearing things
When I can hear him say to her
Forget him, It's over, Your mine now

She said: ""My daughter, I beg of you
I have a with that must come true
The last thing you can do for Mama
Please promise me that you will stay
And take my place while I'm away
And give the children love each day""
I had to cry, what could I say?
How hard I tried to find the words
I prayed she wouldn't see my cry
So much to say that should be heard
But only time to say goodbye to Mama
They say in time that you'll forget
Yet still today my eyes are wet
I tell myself to smile for Mama
Now soon there'll be another spring
And I will start remembering
The way she loved to hear me sing
Her favorite song, ""Ave Maria""

The children have all grown up now
I kept my promise to Mama
I cannot guide them anymore

There isn't anything
Or anyone that I could be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side
You were there for me to love and care for me
When skies were gray
Whenever I was down
You were always there to comfort me
And no one else can be
What you have been to me you will always be
You will always be the girl
In my life for all times

You're always down for me
Have always been around for me even when I was bad
You showed me right from my wrong
Yes you did
And you took up for me
When everyone was downin' me
You always did understand
You gave me strength to go on
There ware so many times
Looking back when I was so afraid
And then you come to me and say to me
I can face anything
And no one else can do
What you have done for me
You'll always be, you will always be

575,Poor Man's Son,"Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son
Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son

My father is a hard earned worker; my mother has a heart of gold
I was never much younger but I feel twice as old

Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son
Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son

But I've got money for food and a little bit of gasoline
I've got plenty of time but I want everything now
But I don't need no gold or silver
Oh I only need a few new things
Or I would buy pearls for my lover
Or just a brand new set of guitar strings

Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son
Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son

I feel a cold wind blowing;
Dark clouds form on the western sky
I've got a feeling like knowing that everyone here will someday die

Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son
Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son

And I see the bright stars shining high above the Bethlehem tower;
I hear the chorus of angels singing out loud the sweetest sound

Oh brothers, let's go down
Let's go down, won't you come on down?
Oh brother, let's go down
Down in the river to pray

Oh sisters, let's go down
Let's go down, won't you come on down?
Oh sister, let's go down
Down in the river to pray

Oh family, let's go down
Let's go down, won't you come on down?

[Part 1: Kamp]
Es tut mir Leid, doch sobald ich losrap, gibt es Ärger!
Denn ich bin hier Todeslisten-Erster mit Josef Hickersberger
Und fürchte Wien wie Sopranos New York
Denn ich führ' mein Team wie Corrado Junior
Mit erhöhtem Pulsschlag wüt man ihn im 08
Nicht wisst wer Schuld hat, ich mea culpa
Sorry, doch bevor ich wieder Schnee verpulver'
Kipp' ich zehn RedBull, Schnaps und Magnesiumsulfat
Ich war immer schon ein Troublemaker
Alle schrien: „Trennt das Kind da von dem Bastelkleber!“
Dann kam Kiffen und die Illuminaten, ich wurde so ein Milchbubi
Dass selbst mich Bubis schlagen, dafür willst du nicht zahlen
Mein Leben ist ein mieser Streifen, wie sollt' die Filmmusik charten?
Ich wollt' nur Murderfame wie Kid in Purple Rain
Doch ich zerstör' selbst den

Aus den Charts ins Jugendhaus
Mich hat FM4 seit Vorradelberg satt, ich stell mich bloß wie
Ortstafeln Kärntner
Hackevoll vor 2/3 von Brand Nubian
Ach, was soll's, ich war immer nur Grand Puba Fan
Und flow' mit 'nem Gefühl, als ob ich Luft anhalt'
Als gäb's hier Druckabfall
Kamp du Futtlapperl
Die VOZ-Saga des Sauproletariers
Ich schuld's mir selbst, frag die Austro Mechana
Los, frag [Golgeter?] und die Wu-Tal Jungs
Wir laufen gut, na und? Ich versteh' nichts von Buchhaltung
Bald lauf' ich mit 'nem Mund voller Kugerln rum
Ich wär' gern smooth wie ein Roots-Album, aber

Oh, is it worth it now to sweat all day and see it slip away

Every night, every day, I keep feeling the same old way
Every night, every day, I keep feeling the same old way

Now then I've been thinking' about it
You say that it's okay - it'll be all right, baby. Hey, baby
But that's fine when all you do is party every night, baby
You say my clothes are soiled and my hands ain't clean
But I'm working overtime checking' every wheel is locked in tight
On that production line, baby, running at the speed of light
Oh, have mercy now, when you look that way and you start to play
Then oh, I'm burning up. I tell you one more day, I'm gonna fade away

It's the same old way, baby, it's the same old way now
It's the same way, it's just the same old way, hangs me up all day

How could you ever tell the truth if you constantly lying

[Frayser Boy]
In the bay I was just another young nigga
Didn't know shit, hood full of fuckin drug dealers
Saw a lot of things
Some of my niggas dead some of my niggas still living
Out here gettin bread tyrina stay away from prison
I got my first gun when I turned sixteen
Cause in a bribe wasn't hard for me to get things
Cause its a lot of shit nobody never knew about
I let the past be the past so I threw it out
And ya I got robbed, and ya I got shot
Thats why I keep the .45 next to me cocked
Ill never slip again, I got artilery
A nigga havin good, no gettin rid of me
So fuck my enemies, theyll never know the half
Youll find yourself dead nigga all because my past
You couldn't survive in the places nigga we be
I miss my homie rest in peace my nigga Kiki

I should never leave my head where I do my dirt
I will never use the same product that I work
I will always check to see whats up under your shirt
Keep a pistol at all times and I will disperse
Check that niggas pocket, check that hoes purse
Cause doin' twenty years (?) gonna get yo feelings hurt
And I never would believe in the word ""friends""
All I believe is the power and the dividends
Get a business to clean up this traffic
They askin' how you get this shit, I'm payin' taxes
And I keep at least three fine attorneys
Cause I dont know when these folks will try to burn me
Dont let your left hand know what your right is doing
Dont let that bitch know shit, fuck some damn chewin'
All I pray is ""god stop me 'fore they catch me""
But the pot still boilin' come and fetch me

We had rain, but we also had some sunny days
Stay away from niggas that was shiesty with them funny ways

So now im older I can never put my guns away
It still was hard even after it was money made
My momma got it had to split it up a hundred ways
Now thats some shit you had to witness if you from the bay
See momma strugglin cause they got her workin underpaid
A nigga tryed to hold it down when it got hard
Them niggas dropped me out of school thats how I got hard
My hoods cool in the day but when it got dark
You werent from around us its manditory that you got robbed
You niggas acting like you know what Ive been through
I went to jail for some shit that I got into
I did some things that I regret, I never ment to
But when youre young troubles easy to get into

People get ready, there's a train a-comin'
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

[Verse]
So, people get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's hope for all among those loved the most

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own, believe me now
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
For there's no hiding place against the kingdom's throne

I remember it was late one night
In the middle of a dream
Woke up in a pool of sweat
Thought I heard a scream
Ran over to the window sill
Stuck my head out for a peek
Dressed in black was a man I didn't recognize
Running down my back street
My heart skipped a beat

[Chorus]
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
When he comes around
Don't make a sound

[Verse 2]
Got the morning paper and the headlines read:
Danger to the queen
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up
The son of a bitch is mean
Vendors on the corner just doin' their job
Acting like nothing's new
Scotland Yard's still looking for him
But he doesn't leave a single clue
What can they do?

[Chorus]
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
When he comes around
Don't make a sound

[Verse 3]
Who's this man who fell out of the sky?
What's he done and where's he live?
How can a man who's a criminal
Be a hero to the kids?
The old couple swear that the Ripper's back
They say it's him all right
The young girl says it's Jesus
And he won't be back again tonight
I wonder who's right

[Chorus]
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out

Some people love to have a good time and won’t let me in the door
I’ve been halfway around this world and nothing did I have
But now it seem my turn has come, a time for me to grab

Enter  GERTRUDE  and  SINDEFY.

Ger.
Ah, Sin! hast thou ever read i' the chronicle of any lady and her waiting woman driven to that extremity that we are, Sin?

Sin.
Not I, truly, madam; and, if I had, it were but cold comfort should come out of books, now.

Ger.
Why, good faith, Sin, I could dine with a lamentable story, now.  O hone, hone, o no nera! etc.  Canst thou tell ne'er a one, Sin?

Sin.
None but mine own, madam, which is lamentable enough: first to be stol'n from my friends, which were worshipful and of good account, by a prentice in the habit and disguise of a gentleman, and here brought up to London, and promis'd marriage, and now likely to be forsaken, for he is in possibility to be hang'd!

Ger.
Nay, weep not, good Sin; my Petronel is in as good possibility as he. Thy miseries are nothing to mine, Sin; I was more than promis'd marriage, Sin; I had it, Sin; and was made a lady; and by a knight, Sin; which is now as good as no knight, Sin. And I was born in London, which is more then brought up, Sin; and already forsaken, which is past likelihood, Sin; and, instead of land i' the country, all my knight's living lies i' the Counter, Sin; there's his castle, now!

Sin.
Which he cannot be forc'd out of, madam.

Ger.
Yes, if he would live hungry a week or two. ""Hunger,"" they say, ""breaks stone walls."" But he is e'en well enough serv'd, Sin, that, so soon as ever he had got my hand to the sale of my inheritance, run away from me, as I had been his punk, God bless us! Would the Knight o' the Sun or Palmerin of England, have us'd their ladies so, Sin? or Sir Lancelot or Sir Tristram?

Sin.
I do not know, madam.

Ger.
Then thou know'st nothing, Sin. Thou art a fool, Sin. The knighthood nowadays are nothing like the knighthood of old time. They rid a-horseback; ours go afoot. They were attended by their squires, ours by their lackeys. They went buckled in their armor, ours muffled in their cloaks. They travell'd wildernesses and deserts; ours dare scarce walk the streets. They were still press'd to engage their honor, ours still ready to pawn their clothes. They would gallop on at sight of a monster; ours run away at sight of a sergeant. They would help poor ladies; ours make poor ladies.

Sin.
Ay, madam, they were knights of the Round Table at Winchester, that sought adventures; but these, of the Square Table at ordinaries, that sit at hazard.

Ger.
True, Sin; let him vanish. And tell me, what shall we pawn next?

Sin.
Ay, marry, madam, a timely consideration; for our hostess, profane woman, has sworn by bread and salt she will not trust us another meal.

Ger.
Let it stink in her hand then. I'll not be beholding to her. Let me see; my jewels be gone, and my gowns, and my red velvet petticoat that I was married in, and my wedding silk stockings, and all thy best apparel, poor Sin! Good faith, rather than thou shouldest pawn a rag more I'd lay my ladyship in lavender — if I knew where.

Sin.
Alas, madam, your ladyship?

Ger.
Ay. Why? You do not scorn my ladyship, though it is in a waistcoat? God's my life! you are a peat indeed! Do I offer to mortgage my ladyship for you and for your avail, and do you turn the lip and the ""alas!"" to my ladyship?

Sin.
No, madam; but I make question who will lend anything upon it.

Ger.
Who? marry, enow, I warrant you, if you'll seek 'em out. I'm sure I remember the time when I would ha' given a thousand pound, if I had it, to have been a lady; and I hope I was not bred and born with that appetite alone; some other gentle-born o' the city have the same longing, I trust. And, for my part, I would afford 'em a penny'rth; my ladyship is little the worse for the wearing, and yet I would bate a good deal of the sum. I would lend it, let me see, for forty pounds in hand, Sin; that would apparel us; and ten pound a year: that would keep me and you, Sin, with our needles; and we should never need to be beholding to our scurvy parents! Good Lord! that there are no fairies nowadays, Sin.

Sin.
Why, madam?

Ger.
To do miracles, and bring ladies money. Sure, if we lay in a cleanly house, they would haunt it, Sin! I'll try. I'll sweep the chamber soon at night, and set a dish of water o' the hearth. A fairy may come and bring a pearl, or a diamond. We do not know, Sin. Or there may be a pot of gold hid o' the back-side, if we had tools to dig for 't! Why may not we two rise early i' the morning, Sin, afore anybody is up, and find a jewel i' the streets worth a hundred pound? May not some great court-lady, as she comes from revels at midnight, look out of her coach as 't is running, and lose such a jewel, and we find it? Ha?

Sin.
They are pretty waking dreams, these.

Ger.
Or may not some old usurer be drunk overnight, with a bag of money, and leave it behind him on a stall? For God-sake, Sin, let's rise to-morrow by break of day and see. I protest, law, if I had as much money as an alderman, I would scatter some on 't i' th' streets for poor ladies to find, when their knights were laid up. And, now I remember my song o' the ""Golden Show'r"": why may not I have such fortune? I'll sing it, and try what luck I shall have after it.

Fond fables tell of old
How Jove in Danaë's lap
Fell in a shower of gold,
By which she caught a clap;
Oh, had it been my hap,
(Howe'er the blow doth threaten)
So well I like the play,
That I could wish all day
And night to be so beaten.

Enter  MISTRESS TOUCHSTONE.

Oh, here's my mother! Good luck, I hope. — Ha' you brought any money, Mother? Pray you, Mother, your blessing. Nay, sweet Mother, do not weep.
Mist. Touch.
God bless you! I would I were in my grave!

Ger.
Nay, dear Mother, can you steal no more money from my father? Dry your eyes, and comfort me. Alas! it is my knight's fault, and not mine, that I am in a waistcoat, and attired thus simply.

Mist. T.
Simply? 'T is better than thou deserv'st. Never whimper for the matter. ""Thou should'st have look'd before thou hadst leap'd."" Thou wert afire to be a lady, and now your ladyship and you may both ""blow at the coal,"" for aught I know. ""Self do, self have."" ""The hasty person never wants woe,"" they say.

Ger.
Nay then, Mother, you should ha' look'd to it. A body would think you were the older! I did but my kind, I. He was a knight, and I was fit to be a lady. 'T is not lack of liking, but lack of living, that severs us. And you talk like yourself and a citiner in this, i' faith. You show what husband you come on, iwis. You smell the Touchstone — he that will do more for his daughter that he has married to a scurvy gold-end man and his prentice, than he will for his tother daughter, that has wedded a knight and his customer. By this light, I think he is not my legitimate father.

Sin.
Oh, good madam, do not take up your mother so!

Mist. T.
Nay, nay, let her e'en alone. Let her Ladyship grieve me still, with her bitter taunts and terms. I have not dole enough to see her in this miserable case, ay, without her velvet gowns, without ribands, without jewels, without French wires, or cheat bread, or quails, or a little dog, or a gentleman usher, or anything, indeed, that's fit for a lady —

Sin.
[ aside ] Except her tongue.

Mist. T.
And I not able to relieve her, neither, being kept so short by my husband. Well, God knows my heart. I did little think that ever she should have need of her sister Golding!

Ger.
Why Mother, I ha' not yet. Alas! good Mother, be not intoxicate for me; I am well enough; I would not change husbands with my sister, I. ""The leg of a lark is better than the body of a kite.""

Mist. T.
I know that; but —

Ger.
What, sweet Mother, what?

Mist. T.
It's but ill food, when nothing's left but the claw.

Ger.
That's true, Mother. Ay me!

Mist. T.
Nay, sweet ladybird, sigh not. Child, madam; why do you weep thus? Be of good cheer; I shall die if you cry, and mar your complexion thus.

Ger.
Alas, Mother, what should I do?

Mist. T.
Go to thy sister's, child; she'll be proud thy Ladyship will come under her roof. She'll win thy father to release thy knight, and redeem thy gowns and thy coach and thy horses, and set thee up again.

Ger.
But will she get him to set my knight up too?

Mist. T.
That she will, or anything else thou'lt ask her.

Ger.
I will begin to love her, if I thought she would do this.

Mist. T.
Try her, good chuck; I warrant thee.

Ger.
Dost thou think she'll do 't?

Sin.
Ay, madam, and be glad you will receive it.

Mist. T.
That's a good maiden; she tells you true. Come, I'll take order for your debts i' the alehouse.

Ger.
Go, Sin, and pray for thy Frank, as I will for my Pet.

593,I Can't Explain,"[girls singing]
Some-thing, I can't, ex-plain (*repeat 7X*)

[Smooth Bee]
I think I love her
But the Lord only knows if she's the one for me
My true Queen
I can't ask for more physical attraction
Baby girl is real hype
She says she wants to bear my child
Is it because I make hit records
Or cause I'm a good lover?
I don't know, I guess I'm a little petrol
Together we do things that I've never done with anyone else
Like eat ice cream together, sharing Chinese food
And of course entering each other, endlessly
You see, when I make love to my woman
I like to tear down walls and build new ones
I take her through multiple ecstasy
And this girlie insists that she's my match
My new love level
But I just can't front anymore
I can't feel it
So therefore I must carry on
Just take me to Love Court
Cause Smooth Bee's not settling down
Call me a tramp, jiggalo, ho, et cetera
But my jimmy's not for sale
More than one woman's my motto
I'll never be caught stranded with a flat tire and no spare, word
Yeah right
In four more months, you'll be having our child
That's if you intend to have our child
And since we both made this commitment
Which brings forth fruit through light
Be like a strong tree, with strong roots
And like a strong limb, I'll never fall off
Unless the sustainer of all living things, allows it
And I want you to remember baby, that I do love you
I really do

[girls singing]
Some-thing, I can't, ex-plain (*repeat 5X*)

[Greg Nice]
I'm sorry baby, I'm so so sorry
I didn't mean to bruise your delicate flower-like emotions
Listen - I was on some hardcore illusion of what love really is
You know I used to put up a phony forcefield shield
And the whole nine yards
Keep my true feelings, locked deep inside a box
But when your love was so strong, so potent
It was too much for my heart at last
Guess I was somewhat immature, but I've grown up now
Baby you gotta take me back, I'm on the verge of self destruction
I never had a love like yours before
Remember our walks through the park, our cozy dinners for two?
Our exhange of love juices?  MMM-mmm!
Baby, don't throw 'em all away
The only reason I broke like I did, is because
I love - I mean, I couldn't react any other way
Just think - another man, sleepin in my bed
With the one I love?  Please, tch
I'm just too nice for that
Please baby, take some time, think about us, you and I, me and you
I'm sure you'll realize that I'm the one for you
I guess I'll say peace now, and remember baby
Please remember, I'll always, and always, always, love you
See you!

[D.J. Teddy Ted]
Baby, you don't love me anymore
I'm not sure you really did before
You see I couldn't see through your phony charms
Nothin really mattered when I took you in my arms
You see I found you so fascinatin
Oh baby so fascinatin
You see I thought you were the one for me
Found out you were nothin but a fantasy
You know, you left me standing lonely
Girl, you left me standing to cry
But yet you weren't woman enough to say goodbye
But there is, there is one thing I must thank you for

595,The Jolly Green Giant,"Hey Jolly Green Giant! What's new besides ho ho ho?

Would you believe a rowboat with three leaky worms?

You heard about the Jolly Green Giant (potato)
He's so big and mean (artichoke hearts)
He stands there laughing with his hands on his hips
And then he hits you with a can of beans

He lives down in his valley (spinach)
The cat stands tall and green (brussel sprouts)
Well he ain't no prize. There's no women his size
And that's why the cat's to mean

One day he left, his valley cat
I mean to say this cat was mad
Now lookin' round, he wasn't gone long
And then he ran into an Amazon

And this changed his whole complexion (broccoli)
He'd never seen such a beautiful sight (asparagus)
Well he looked at her and she looked at him
And he almost passed out from fright

He looked at her, thought what a dilly
He touched her once, she slapped him silly
Now this was something he'd never said
He looked at her and she commenced
Now listen pal this ain't no flew
I can't see goin' with a big green fool

You heard about the jolly green giant (watermelons)
Never let his troubles cross your mind (corn!)
He couldn't get sally, so he went back to his valley
The cat was color blind

When you feel that you can make it all alone
Remember no one is big enough to have it all alone
Just ask the lonely
'cause they know the [?] and pain
Of losing a love you can never regain

The young and foolish laugh at love (Woo hoo)
And slowly  run away (Woo hoo hoo hoo)
Confident and sure that fate (Woo hoo)
Will bring another love their way

But ask the lonely
How vainly a heart can yearn
For losing a love that will never return
(Just ask the lonely)

They'll tell you a story of sadness
A story too hard to believe

598,Downtown,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I went to the moped store, said ""Fuck it""
And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe (Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace (Downtown)

Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey

Dope
Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow
You can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

And brand new car

Chills run down my spine
Every time he wants to kiss me
He makes me feel so fine

And make romance
That's when I fell in love

Lonely, oh so lonely

Before I go I'd like to say one thing
Don't close your ears to me
Take my advice and you'll find out that being
Just another girl won't cause you misery

Don't say you can get any boy at your call
Don't be so smug or else
You'll find you can't get any boy at all

614,Shake,"[JACQUES]
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

You were meek as a lamb

If we was up in this just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit

[Verse 1: Boots Riley]
I spit game on a regular basis; now everybody
Looking at my hand like I'm holding all the aces
Cool that they know our faces, from different places
But you can't catch up if you don't know what the pace is
Everywhere we go you know especially in the O we hear
""Coup, Coup, you know we got love fo' sho'""
But even mo' when they see us on B-E-and-T and
M-T-and-V but me and E can't pay the P-G-and-E
Power come from the barrel of a bucker
I use the mic so that we aim at the same motherfucker
Cause your shit could go gold, and the only cash you got
Is the silver kind that don't fold
I'm gettin dope when they ask about the road that I passed
My peoples really be thinking they gon' come up fast
And then come rap and shake they ass
You ain't the first motherfucker who done scheme to scam
Then plan to scram up out the ghetto let me break this down
From kids to Grams, fuck the videos with the Benzes
And the cellular phones, spending hundreds like quarters
The Benz is they partner's, the money's on loan, and umm...
""The cellular number you have reached is out of order.""

It's true, it's a few getting fund expansions
It ain't like Acorn Projects gon' move into mansions
Straight authenticized shit, over synthesized hits
With this misty eyed 'mental make your teeth grit
And I'm not tryin to diss like it's a bandwagon trend
They selling six-packs of them wavies out the ghetto again
In the 20's it was rocks, in the 50's doo-wop
It's nineteen-ninety-fo' and everybody's store hop'n
And ain't nobody really trying to hear me speak it
They too busy watchin luke, gettin interviewed by Robin Leach
So if you're modest and don't hire economics
Just kick it with The Coup, smoke this dub sack of funk!

I'm fitt'n to pitch a fit cause I'm tired of hearing dumb shit
Why do motherfuckers get up out and go for single
When the real high rollers draft a army to protect they Pringles?

[Verse 3: E-Roc]
Confusion, just a system based on prostitution
They done ganked you, don't be no stank fool with they solution
Unless you got about a million semi-automatics
You gon' think you strivin doin them ho-style acrobatics

[Boots]
No I don't have it like that, Planned Parenthood ain't got it
I keep my whole life savings stuffed in my back pocket, flock it
I'm scraping fronts off like plaque, no slack
I come realistic like Radio Shack
Intact and fat motherfuckers finally get they shit right
Ain't no fight, they scared shitless, all they do is grab the mic
Ain't no organizing real shit on the street, it's a fleet
Of revolutionaries in the studio making beats
So fuck the fame, fuck the game, fuck the riches foo'
I ain't got shit unless all my folks gon' have theirs too

[B] Now, motherfuckers done made a name for theyself
[E] But a name don't mean wealth
[B] Let me up you on this shit
[E] If we was up in this, just to get up out the ghetto
Let me tell you right now, we damn near done quit
Now, motherfuckers done made a name for themselves

Oh and just like the river I've been running ever since

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

I go to the movie, and I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me ""don't hang around""

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

[Verse 4]
Then I go to my brother, and I say, ""brother, help me please""
But he winds up knockin' me back down on my knees
Lor’, there been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on

625,What Have They Done To The Rain,"Just a little rain falling all around
The grass lifts its head to the heavenly sound
Just a little rain, just a little rain
What have they done to the rain

Just a little boy standing in the rain
The gentle rain that falls for years
And the grass is gone, the boy disappears
And rain keeps falling like helpless tears
And what have they done to the rain

Just a little breeze out of the sky
The leaves nod their head as the breeze blows by
Just a little breeze with some smoke in its eye
What have they done to the rain

Just a little boy standing in the rain
The gentle rain that falls for years
And the grass is gone, the boy disappears
And rain keeps falling like helpless tears

So Bye Bye Baby Baby Goodbye
Bye Bye Baby don't make me cry

Guess I will never know you better

627,Born To Be Together,"Though we face
These difficult times
If we have faith
The sun will shine

Consider ravens, black and bold
Suffering rain and winter cold
For they neither sow nor reap
And they have no [qualm?]
In which to sleep

And we were born to be together
And our lifetime isn't long
But we can dream beyond forever
Before we hear his loves sweet song

So we've got to stay together
And we've got to sing loves song
Even through the changing weather
It's together we belong

If God's so close
The grass so green
Just love can solve
Life's mystery

Was I not a raven yesterday
Didn't you take me far away
For you are the lilly of the lake
So beautiful make no mistake

And we were born to be together
And our lifetime isn't long
But we can dream beyond forever
Before we hear his loves sweet song

So we've got to stay together
And we've got to sing loves song
Even through the changing weather
It's together we belong

We were born to be together
And our lifetime isn't long
But we can dream beyond forever
Before we hear his loves sweet song",Gordon Haskell,1965,"[54, 52, 55, 56, 63, 78]",6
628,Like A Child,"[Intro]
Today, you are who you are today. See?
You're still me, but you're a newer version

Myself ten years from now
It's so far away
It's almost impossible to imagine
Am I alone or is there a wonderful person next to me?

[Verse 1]
Back back in the day
When they all kept laughing at me
Before I even knew I had a debt like Faye
Watching MTV, young Sway Calloway

I'm blessed
Finding a rhyme to rewind when I'm stressed
Cosign with Divine but my mind is a mess
In time I'll recline
For the moment it's retrograde
Get back to the days when I played

PS, DS, DC, GC
Had 12 permanently on the VC
RPG, level up until my MP's
High enough to get me
10 times stronger than enemies

Finna be finishing up assemblies fast like
""If we participate then we don't have to be in class, right?
Truthfully it's cool with me
I used to be a decent kid in my day

Smooth Operator like Sade
Playing Moonwalker on Friday
Little Hokage
Born to be more than he is
His sword is so worn
From the wars that he wanted to win

Cleaned his recorder again
But he didn't record at the time
It was not in his sight
When the timing is right
He'll get guided to light
By a couple of people deciding to fight

In the meantime and in between
Just checking this slime in the ice machine
If The Price is Right then I might delight
And indulge on a little bit of this and that

My hand-eye was off
Wasn't fit to bat
Couldn't shoot the shot
Never picked a mat

So to sum it up
Athletic was not me
Instead I was watching Kenpachi Zaraki
Flame

[Bridge 1: Laughing Bull & Spike Spiegel]

[Laughing Bull]
What did you see?

[Spike Spiegel]
I had a dream
It was the first time
The first that I was really scared
Shook with fear
If one thing, one atom had given way
Then I would be gone

[Verse 2]
Man I'm too young to be feeling this old
My fire's too bold to submit to the cold
Don't know if I'm growing or going
Some go with the wind I just flow in the moment

I know my opponent
We share our components
I roll with my sensei
I can't be a ronin
I think it's time that I find my way
The sky might fall but it's fine by me

Learned so much in a year or two
The fact that I'm living's a miracle
Coming in with the revenge of General Chao
Like jiu mo gwai gwaai faai di zau

Got talismans if I'm wrapped in sin
I don't even know which one to pick
It's hard coming back again
Feeling like Richard Pryor on the Sunset Strip

Recently I've just been learning some lessons
The heart is a part that gets burned a second
The brain is the key but it doesn't get credit
The rest of our parts, we don't give any mention

And we all want love
Regardless of whether or not we admit it
Whenever we don't then we need it the most
But it's in those times that we hardly ever give it

I'm livid
I can't express my emotions
The way I've been hoping
So now I feel like they don't get it

Man it's so hard to explain
How my heart and my brain
Are still one in the same but so different

Think about suicide less but I still think of death
I confess, and I bet that they pivot
Harder to trust if I never got off of the bus
And I know that it's enough to rivet
KiDD

[Bridge 2]

[Laughing Bull]
Know this Swimming Bird:
This blue eye percieves all things conjoined
The past, the future, and the present
Everything flows and all is connected
This eye is not merely seen reality
It is touching the truth

[Spike Spiegel]
Yeah... I see what you mean

[Verse 3]
Will I get a job that I hate to do
And in 18 years go back to school?
Or lose my cool and act a fool
Go the reunion like

""Look what they made me
I've really gone crazy""
Or maybe I'll be
Performing on stages amazing to me
I really don't know
Confused on which path that I will choose go

Oh well, so swell in the life of me
Never been great but I'd like to be
Really don't talk much but I might decree
If I could I'd live just like Han-Jee

Ainz
But it just won't work that way
And I have to accept it
No skill when the times get hectic
I could send a message
But there is no telling who stuck around

Time is my friend when I'm down
It's also my enemy
I'm trying not to make a sound
So they don't finish me

Got to gather up my energy
Feeling like Trunks with infinite ki
But this disease is sickening me
I need to travel cryogenically

Wake up to Logic on Paradise vibing
I'm using my noggin' like Batman and Robin
They say that they're mobbin'
They're probably lying
I'm trying to master the timing

Of looking ahead of it
My soul is so delicate
Play the role of a delegate
I'm Delico mixed with a little bit of Eren Yeager
I don't think you know who you're messing with
Him

[Outro]

Knowing me
I'm sure you're causing all kinds of trouble
For lots of different people
I'm sorry, I don't mean to, but it's all right
That's part of life too isn't it?
You're not perfect but you've got a lot to give
So remember
I'll always be cheering you on

In your time
I'm no longer here but I am here today
And I'll always be cheering for you right here
Cheering for you

630,Real Live Girl,"Pardon me miss
But I've never done this
With a real live girl
What could be harmful

In holding an armful
Of a real live girl
Pardon me if you're affectionate squeeze
Fogs up my goggles and

Buckles my knees
I'm simply drown in the sight, and the sounds
And the scent and the feel
Of a real live girl

Nothing can beat getting swept off your feet
By a real live girl
Dreams of you but don't compare with a hunk
Of a real live girl

Girl's were to girlish
Was once my belief
What a reversal and what a relief
I'll take the flowering hat

And the towering hill
And the squeal of a real live girl
I've seen photographs and faximilies
That have set my heart off in a whirl

But I over look everyone in the book
For a real live girl
Take your vernecion or romanaprrection
Ideal live girl

Go be a hold out for Helen of Troy
I am a healthy American Boy
And I rather gape at the dear little shape of the stir
And the kill of a real live girl

All you fools just sound the same
Ain’t no credit to your name
Ain’t no credit line open, that’s discrediting the fame
Form your business in the name, something unique like a slang
Make a difference, make a change
But ain’t no puppets on a string
Don’t be chilling on the couch, remember this is for the clout
Remember this is for the poor niggas that’ll represent you when you’re out
Forget you when you need your friends, fuck it we just meet again (why)
All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
Always was a winner even when I wasn’t 'posed to
The money getting bigger as if it wasn’t supposed to
Just a lonely nigga, talk too much to myself, need a break
On July 8th broke down heaven’s gates
Now I stay high all day
Fuck you leaving, fuck all evening
Call me mister fuck all day
Trap all day and night
Don’t need a house much less you ‘bout some change
Expand my conscious, tryna’ walk on water
Feel the earth on me
You hatin’, I’ll be somewhere slayin’ bitches by their face on me
Catch a fade, Kobe, with an eighth on me
Not phased, don’t pass that shit homie
Cough, smoke, cough, got my shit sealed off
‘Bout to put some in the air, ‘til a nigga doze off
Cos you got some shrooms, I got a room
You and me ‘til we reach the moon

Opinions always alter when you’re done
Pray to put you down, afraid to look around, instead I pen it for my dogs (Hoo!)
Know my city give me 150 for my steez, 150 for my beats
Three niggas, we gotta eat
Shouts to fans that’s overseas, hey
Independent grind, at least we did form a company
We a bond that never breaks, never giving up the cake
Not a fan of pointing fingers at men
It’s dependent on who can pay for academics
Homie your chemists are missing appendages
You back into handling business, no kidding

Can’t tell me nothin’, there’s no need for discussion
I’m the sinner in Saint, I'm the box logo bully
Used to buy Bathing Ape, now they send this shit to me
I paved the way for niggas that're scared to say what they ain't wanna say
Now watch a demon demonstrate, annihilate
Love / hate it's all the same
Will I die from my homicide
Or will I die from taking too much drugs?
Lord knows I deserve to die on an acid high and I’m double cupped
Coke line, hundred blunts
Seen a few bitches I’d love to fuck
2Pac in 96 and troublesome
27 club, here I come
Comma, c-c-c-c comma, comma, comma
A whole lot of decimals
I just s-see my account and c-c-c-c-c-c-c count all my blessings up
Bloodstream full of chemical
Crip, Blood, twist your fingers up
Better than some of them veterans
Bet they gon’ say it’s beginners luck
I would die for my niggas, but would they do the same?
Hennessey by the gallon, I'm losing my balance and manage the pain
I would ride for my niggas, just show me the lane
My grandaddy's still in the kitchen, w-w-whipping the ‘caine
My celly’ keep ringing
I cannot find enough coverage to answer
The backwoods is hitting
Hope that that shit is not giving me cancer
Trip on acid while I'm rapping, Sippin' muddy, counting money
I think she took too many xannies, she fell asleep while she was sucking

Made it out the gutter, shout out to my mother

Isolation is not good for me
Isolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree

636,For Lovin' Me,"[Verse]
That's what you get for loving me[x2]
Everything you have is gone that you can see
That's what you get for loving me
I am not the kind to hang around
With any new love that I found
Moving is my stock and trade
I'm moving on
I won't think of you when I'm gone
So don't you shed a tear for me
I am not the love you thought I'd be
I've got a hundred more like you
So don't be blue
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through
Now there you go you're crying again[x2]
But then someday your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass your way again

Just like a paper tiger
Torn apart by idle hands
Through the helter skelter morning
Fix yourself while you still can
No more ashes to ashes
No more cinders from the sky
Let all the laws of creation
Tell a dead man how to die

O deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

Looking through a broken diamond
To make the past what it should be
Through the ruins and the weather
Capsized boats in the sea

O deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

We're just holding on to nothing
To see how long nothing lasts

O deserts down below us
And storms up above

638,Heart Of Stone,"[JANE SEYMOUR]
You've got a good heart
But I know it changes
A restless tide, untameable
You came my way
And I knew a storm could come too
You'd lift me high, or let me fall

But I took your hand
Promised I'd withstand
Any blaze you blew my way
'Cause something inside
It solidified
And I knew I'd always stay

You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test
You'll find that I'm unshakeable
When the fire's burnt
When the wind has blown
When the water's dried
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone

You say we're perfect
A perfect family
You hold us close for the world to see
And when I say you're the only one I've ever loved
I mean those words truthfully

But I know, without my son
Your love could disappear
And no, it isn't fair
But I don't care
'Cause my love will still be here

You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test
You'll find that I'm unshakeable
When the fire's burnt
When the wind has blown
When the water's dried
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone

Soon I'll have to go
I'll never see him grow
But I hope my son will know
He'll never be alone
'Cause like a river runs dry
And leaves its scars behind
I'll be by your side
'Cause my love is set in stone

Yeah

Yeah it's the way we are
We were smoking by 11 and knocking 'round town
Beat 'em ups on my arm
We were never good at selling, couldn't cut down
And I stay with my father while his friends die of heart attacks
He's got a heart made of stone but he never gets cold because the sun's always on his back
""I used to think you were cool and I believed you had a wonderful vision
But I soon found out you're a terrible friend and your mother's on the television""

""Well, it's coming to the end of you and me,"" she said, ""is that alright?""
And how can you complain about life and talk about being bored?
If you just sit at Pete's house playing video games, doing sniff that you can't afford
I can't be picking up in the town
So get me one off Adam if he's sorting you out
I don't really care what all your friends were about
I was always looking for a way to get out
It's just a reflection on the size of your house
A silver spoon and a zoot in your mouth
But you're alright
Yeah it's alright

So here we are, it's quarter to 11, we're knocking 'round town
Pushing in, in the bar, you can cry until 11, it's a quarter of an hour
And why stay if you hate it so much?
You think you're well cool
You just write about sex and killing yourself and how you hardly ever went to school
Don't you want to take me up in the clouds?
Pretend that I'm the one and you can show me about
She was talking marriage so we had to get out
Now he's making up for it by sleeping about
Your ultimatum's a ridiculous joke
I'm gonna pick that option that allows me to smoke
But I'm alright
Yeah it's alright

Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby

651,Love Potion Number Nine,"I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy
With the gold cap tooth
She's got a pad down at 34th and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion #9

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm
And she made a magic sign
She said
""Whatcha need is
A bottle of Love Potion #9""
She bent down and turned around
And gave me a wink
She said I'm gonna make it up
Right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine
And looked like India ink
I held my nose
I closed my eyes
I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissing everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop
Down at 34th and Vine
He broke my little bottle of
Love Potion #9

She bent down and turned around
And gave me a wink
She said I'm gonna make it up
Right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine
And looked like India ink
I held my breath and closed my eyes
I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight

Hold on to what you got
You had better hold on
Hold on to what you got

'Cause if you think nobody wants it
Just throw it away and you will see
Someone will have it before you can count
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, they will

Listen fellas, you know, it's not all the time
That a man can have a good woman
A woman that he can call his very own
A woman who'll stay right there at home
And mind the children while he's gone to work

A woman who'll have his dinner cooked
When he comes home
Where some men make mistakes is when they go out
And stay because they feel that no other man
Wants his woman but him, but listen

If you think no other man wants her
Just throw her away and you will see
Some man will have her before you can count
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, he will

Ha, ha, listen girls, this goes for you, too
Because you know I've seen so many women
Who've had so many good men in life

Men who would stand by 'em through thick and thin
Men who would go to work everyday and bring home
Their hard earned pay
Men who would give their women anything that their
Little heart desired

Where some women make mistakes
Is when their men go out and let 'em play
They would stay because they felt that no other
Woman wanted him but her, listen

If you think that no other woman wants him
Just pitch him out in the streets and you will see
Some woman will have your man before you can count
One, two, three, yes, you will, yes, you will",Hank Williams Jr.,1965,"[44, 18, 6, 5, 5, 11, 15, 28, 40]",9

I guess I exercise too much, when I work out
Shows too turnt out, return home burnt out
Now I got to hear all the shit, that you heard 'bout
Can I live? What, these niggas want me off a bridge?
If I say it's turnt down, do I burn that shit?
Truth is, if it ain't real, I don't feel it
If it don't hit my spirit, I don't get near it

See these foes biting the flows, they even jooks the pose

Cause this really be the year that I feast, capisce?
Nothing defeats the beast, I speak my piece
Know niggas in the streets that heat seek for me
Release and squeeze
Might put a Halloween between your spleen
Retreat or trickle down to your last pound of green
Know what I mean?
This shit is like taking candy from the babies
Under these rappers is just a bunch of Now and Laters
They too sweet, plus they lease their Mercedes
Can't be second greatest, I'm the best and def your favorite
My flow in-depth nigga, I got my wave up
It's either get your tidal waved, or you could be my neighbor
Cause if I can't eat, then you can't either

677,Thou Shalt Not Steal,"[Verse 1]
In the bible it says thou shall not steal
But I have found the love I want
My heart knows that it's real
I found him in my best friend's arms
I stole him though I meant no harm
I found myself a sweetheart and lost myself a friend

[Verse 2]
The love I thought I'd found was just a careless dream
Since then I've realized some things
Aren't always what they seem
But I can't trade my love for pride
My conscience just can't be my guide
Too late to head the warning the law thou shalt not steal

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I stole to satisfy a longing in my heart
I didn't stop to realize
The trouble I would start
To steal a love is wrong you'll find

It's day was over and dead
It will stand forever in my memory

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
Don't let 'em tear that
Precious building down

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
For there's not another like it
In the country or the town

It was not so long ago that
I went tripping through the snow
Out to that house behind
My old hound dog

Where I'd sit me down to rest
Like a snowbird on his nest
And read the Sears and Roebuck catalog

I would hum a happy tune
Peeping through the quarter moon
As my daddy's kin had done before

It was in that quiet spot
Daily cares could be forgot
It gave the same relief
To rich and poor

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
Don't let 'em tear that
Precious building down

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
For there's not another like it
In the country or the town

Now it was not a castle fair
But I could dream my future there
And build my castles to
The yellow jacket's drone

I could orbit around the sun
Fight with General Washington
Or be a King upon a golden throne

It wasn't fancy built at all
It had newspapers on the wall
It was air conditioned
In the wintertime

It was just a humble hut
But it's door was never shut
And a man could get inside
Without a dime

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
Don't let 'em tear that
Precious building down

Don't let 'em tear that
Little brown building down
For there's not another like it

When all of a sudden it started to rain
And I do mean rain
I couldn't hardly see nothing
Well we kept driving for about another mile

I see this stalled car right smack in front of me

Cause I didn't have none to start to with
So I swerved to the left and what do I see?

And I knew at last me and my baby were about to meet
The Leader of the
Pack

Well when I come to I looked around
And there was the Leader
And there was the Pack
And over there was my baby
And over there was my baby
And way over there was my baby

I want my baby back
Got to have my baby back
I miss her oh so much
Can't live without her touch

It's been many months now since that fateful night
And you know something, I've tried
Believe me I have tried
But I just can't make it without my Baby
So I've decided I'm going to have back
One way or another
Oh Baby, I dig you so much
Hot dang. Pay dirt

I got my Baby back
Now I got my Baby back
I love her oh so much
Can't live without her touch
I got my Baby back",Jimmy Cross,1965,"[92, 93, 95]",3
687,Suddenly I'm All Alone,"Suddenly, I'm all alone
Out of a clear blue sunny sky
The happy world I found
Came tumbling down
When you said goodbye

Suddenly, I'm all alone
And I found I don't know what to do
I pace the floor and cry
And I wonder why
My love fell through

I was a king, with everything
'Til I fell from my throne

My honour used to be
And suddenly, I'm I'm all alone

Only yesterday, I held you in my arms
And when I heard you say
You'd love me forever
It's funny but forever
Must have came today

Suddenly, I'm all alone
And the sun still shines above
The happy world I found
Came tumbling down
When I lost your love

Now I've got nothing
To cling to
But memories we've known
They're not very much company
They only bring misery",Walter Jackson,1965,[96],1

Now when Julie's fella
Came to call
And saw them kissing

He started home at once

Now Julie said
I'm surprised at you
Don't go acting like a dunce

Why, he's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine
You're liable for to
See him here any old time

He's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine, go on
He's a cousin of mine

Now when Julie had
Explained her relationship
He said, honey, that may be so

But this fella don't look
Like a thirty-second cousin
That I met here a week ago

Julie smiled at him
And joined her cousin, sad
And as they slowly walked away

He heard him ask
Who was that fella
And he heard his Julie say

Why, he's a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine
You're liable for to
See him here any old time

He's just a cousin of mine
A cousin of mine, go on
A cousin of mine

Would I fool you, go on
He's a cousin of mine",Sam Cooke,1965,"[73, 74, 79, 81]",4

Even my girl think of beating you up
The way you keeping in touch
She don't know if niggas cheating or what

Even Walkers ain't got this much flavour
They say I'm super bad like McLovin
Now man are calling me family all of a sudden
And I'm like ""Mum, how come you never told me that I had all these cousins?""
This corner I'm standing in, never felt claustrophobic when I came in 10 minutes ago
Now my backs against the wall
It's a good job I'm tall
So I can always see clear
Even with all the smoke in the air
I know some are standing here cause of loving fame
But a lot of them are here out of fear

I never ever knew that one song could make my whole life change
Last week I boarded six planes
But I can't complain, this is the moment I've been waiting for
Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door
I'm with Boy Better Know let them all in
But there's a flip side to all things
So before you sign yourself up to the high life
Make sure you read the small print
Please
Listen to me when I'm talking
The guy you're looking at right now is the guy I was this morning
I never had a pen but I made a mark
Even when I top the chart, I'll be the same guy that I was at the start
I hope to die I cross my heart

How could I know this fascination
Would turn to love for you and me
How to tell you of my heartache?
How to tell you I'm not free?
How can I bear to see your heart break
To see your heart break over me

Amore scusami se sto piangendo
Amore scusami, ma ho capito che lasciandoti io soffriro

Amore baciami, arrivederci amore baciami
E se mi penserai ricordati che amo te

Ti ricordi quella sera che per gioco ti bacia?
Sembrava solo un'avventura, un'avventura in riva al mar
Ti baciavo nel silenzio, non volevo confessar
Che stavo forse a poco a poco innamorandomi di te

My love, forgive me 
I didn't mean to have it end like this
I didn't mean to have you fall in love, in love with me

My love, please kiss me
Arrivederci amore, kiss me
Though we're apart, you'll still be in my heart
I love so, I love so, I love so",Robert Goulet,1965,"[41, 28, 22, 18, 16]",5

711,Hawaii Tattoo,"[Voice Sample]
Ich will dir sagen, wie sehr du mich bewegt hast
Und verändert hast
Wenn du mir etwas versprechen willst, versprich mir eins:
Versuche dich mit meinen Augen zu seh'n!
Du warst mein Leben, Holly
Aber ich bin in deinem Leben nur ein Kapitel
Und jetzt kommt es... das Entscheidende:
P.S.: Ich werde dich immer lieben

[Part 1]
Ich kann mich gut erinnern, als ich dich zum Flieger brachte
Und als Du weg warst für dich fünf oder sechs Lieder machte
Und es geht schnell vorbei, ich sagte man ich warte drauf
Und hab mir direkt einfach 'nen 400 Gras gekauft
Und ich bereue vieles, doch ich war nicht klein zu kriegen
Ich wollte sparen, um für Dich mal nach Hawaii zu fliegen
Wenn du das hörst, würdest du gerne in mein Face spucken
Ich weiß du denkst an mich, würdest du 50 Erste Dates gucken
Mein größter Traum war es, mit dir in eine Wohnung zieh'n
Und jetzt sitz' ich da und geh' 'nen Dübel in der Wohnung zieh'n
Ich wollte dir sagen es war schön auf unser'm Magic Ban
Da war Ich mir sicher: Ich beschütz dich mit ner Getlingun
Ich wär nie weggerannt, wenn was gewesen wär
Sie war die Richtige ganz sicher es ist eben schwer
Zu akzeptier'n: Es hört alles mit 'nem Ende auf
Wenn ich an dich denke man krieg ich eine Gänsehaut

[Hook]
Für dich bin ich tot im Himmel, im Ernst, Alter ohne Mist
Ich weiß, dass es mittlerweile komisch is', so ohne dich
Ich hab' mich drauf eingelassen und ich geh' jetzt einen Paffen
Auch wenn es nie wieder kommt, ich fange an Hawaii zu hassen
Für dich bin ich tot im Himmel, im Ernst, Alter ohne Mist
Ich weiß, dass es mittlerweile komisch is', so ohne dich
Kannst du mich hier leiden sehen? Ich fang' an mir einzureden:
Alles wäre anders, mann, wärst du nie auf Hawaii gewesen


[Part 2]
Du wolltest ein Tattoo und keine Strophen haben
Jetzt willst du dein Leben leben, doch ich muss so viel sagen
Ich bin so froh: Durch dich hatte ich einen roten Faden
In meinem Leben, ey ich muss Dir einfach so viel sagen
Du warst mein Leben und ich deins und ja das weißt du
Ich lass diesen Scheiß zu: Neid, Wut, beiß' zu
Eh, ich hab ne Ausbildung um was zu lernen
Wo ist die Sicherheit denn hin, dass wir das schaffen werden?
Ich hätte ""R&M"" verliebt an jede Wand gepinselt
Ich habe dich angehimmelt und du hast mich angehimmelt
Ich wär bestimmt nicht hier
Ich würde das nie schreiben, hättest du mich nicht so inspiriert, dann wär ich nicht so deprimiert
Mit einer rosa Brille wollten wir schon Pläne machen ich würde mich auf ewig hassen, würde ich dich so gehen lassen
Und falls du weg bist und man sich nie mehr wieder
Sieht dann höre ich dieses Lied und weiß das es die Liebe gibt

[Hook]

[Part 3]
Und ich weiß: Ich muss das locker sehen
Doch anstatt ein Mann zu sein, blieb ich einfach stotternd steh'n
Ich kann mich ja doch verstehen, warum lass ich mir von dieser Frau immer den Kopf verdreh'n?
Ich muss mir das Ott da nehm'
Sorry! Es tut mir Leid, ey vielleicht nerv' ich dich
Für mich war es sicherlich kein erster Fick bei Kerzenlicht
Es war halt zu perfekt, vielleicht sahst du zwar glücklich aus
Und dachtest so wie ich es ist zwar schön, aber erdrückt dich auch
Ich will nicht daran denken, doch diese verliebten Augen
Machen es schwer und ich kann nichts, außer das Weed zu rauchen
Ich schrieb dir Tausend Songs, keiner davon aufgenommen
Direkt wieder gelöscht, ich nehm' die graue Bong und lauf davon
Keiner davon gut genug, keiner davon tut mir gut
Ich will dass du das hier findest, wenn du Kuchen auf Youtube suchst
Eh Ich trau mir selber diesen Mut nie zu, es kommen andere, doch keine wird so gut wie du

712,Seven Letters,"[Chorus: KingJet]
Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go
It's hard when enough is enough
And only you know enough is enough
But really what's a problem? A problem
A seven letter word that can go

[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
The world ain't ever cuttin' no slack
I've seen the smartest lookin' fall into the grips of a trap
But I'm illusive, been a victim of depression
But killin' myself is foolish
Though I contemplate existence, a nigga never gon' do it
I was gifted to the Earth to spread love, call me lil Cupid
Mendin' broken hearts, show them the truth, and watch them use it
I was built into perfection, been learnin', embrace your flaws
When I stand in front the mirror a nigga looking at God
That's some arrogant from the pacifist
Never been a pastor, shit
But I can move the masses like a pastor's wit
Finesse it 'til my casket dig
Rebellin' like I'm Kaepernick
Conscious captain, ask the kid
Put life into your mannequin
You man of king, I'm lightsaber dancin' like I'm young Anakin
I'm Kobe buzzer beatin' for three, fade away splashin'
Disaster, attack your life you tend to panic
I done learned to dance over the water like Michael Jackson, ay
Truth is I don't know the answers to the game
I've been readin' the instructions, the shit is fuckin' insane
So I made my own rules for the shit
There's not really many laws 'cause Karma's basically it
If you could understand, puttin' out is what you gon' get
Then you could prosper, 'cause energy remains at the end
Whenever time's up, the mind grows weary
Thinkin' of thoughts of death
But there's beauty in the thought of the power that will be left

[Chorus: KingJet]
Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go
It's hard when enough is enough
And only you know enough is enough
But really what's a problem? A problem
A seven letter word that can go

[Verse 2: AKTHESAVIOR]
Uh, lane switchin', I came up and made a difference
Had to distance all that negative energy out my system
I done witnessed people try to condition our way of living
Never givin', not at all, while I'm present to my course
Make myself into a boss, I don't follow baby I lead
So let ease, burnin' flowers, hypnotic, I'm livin' dreams
Wasn't promised but the light gave me guidance, now I achieve
Like a hyphen, how they try to divide us but now I see
We on the same team, different players, same league
But my progress ain't your progress, we ain't on the same speed
Clean my act up like a janitor, how I obtain keys
I was in the trap too, just told to set my chains free
Find a better way, no more meddling in these streets
Quick to split your melon, once gon' you tell 'em they gotta eat
Now my soul embellished when I express it up on a beat
Countin' every blessin' when I reflect on what used to be
Young AK had a vision and he never went astray
When I got rid of all the doubts is when I seen my ghosted plane
I was in a world of pain, a crowded mind, no room for gains
Then I staggered through the rain, that's when your boy became a king
It's more than entertainment, guard your brain, they try to tame it
I been ridin' solo, you get set up by the ones you hang with
Livin' for tomorrow been the motto since I was in cradle
When it's time to go I hope you get my message on the table, uh

[Chorus: KingJet]
Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen
Still never a reason to go
It's hard when enough is enough
And only you know enough is enough
But really what's a problem, a problem
A seven letter word that can go

[Outro: KingJet]
Problem, problem
It's hard to understand but it's a part of life
When you lost one and fallen

713,Makin' Whoopee,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin'

Now picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring, yes

He's washin dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks
Thats what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year, maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

Yeah, she sits alone
Most every night
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write
He says he's busy
But she says, ""is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

Now he doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
Judge say, ""Budge, right into jail
You'd better keep her. I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee.""

You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs

Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)

And I'm coming undone, 'cause the tears don't end

'im. Hey, Murray, is it true Betty's wearin' your ring? Uh-huh
Who's that bangin' on the piano? I don't know. You goin' out with
Her tonight? You bet yer fur. By the way, where'd ya meet her?

I met her one day at the Laundromat
She turned around and smiled at me, ya get the picture? (Yes, we see)
And that's when I fell in love with the Leader Of the Laundromat

My folks were always putting her down (down, down)
Because her laundry came back brown (brown, brown)
I don't care if they think she's bad
I fell in love 'cause she looked so sad
I got a date tonight with the Leader Of the Laundromat

(Dang it!)

My dad said ""Find a laundry that's new"" (find a laundry that's new)
How can I tell my baby we're through (tell my baby we're through)
Gotta drive right into town
I don't care if my shirts are brown
I got a date tonight with the Leader Of the Laundromat

(Dang it!)

When I finally got there, I told her it was all over between us. I'll never forget the
Hurt and the funny look in her eye. She grabbed my laundry and ran into the street
Directly into the path of a runaway garbage truck. I yelled ""watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out, watch ou-ou-t""

(Dang it!)

I felt so messy standing there (messy standing there)
My daddy's shorts were everywhere (daddy's shorts were everywhere)
Tenderly I kissed her goodbye
Picked up my clothes, they were finally dry

721,Promised Land,"[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh
And on across Caroline
We stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
We never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling outta the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Riding across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh, when the pilot told me us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten o nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line",Chuck Berry,1965,"[49, 44, 41, 45]",4

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-ohh
What now?

[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Please tell me)
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)

Deal with shit that you'll never know
By the rules, sticking to the code

Got a reputation with the name
Passed the lane, I just want the change
Rappers lame, niggas want the fame
Get out of the way, bitches say I changed
Love the Range, that'll probly change
Run upon me when you think I am slipping
Big shit gripper, I ain't timid
Brinks bricks break'em real simple
You would think I'm talking recompressed

735,Oh No Not My Baby,"[Verse 1]
When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all i had a faith in you
I just kept on saying

[Chorus]
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

[Verse 2]
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and i should use my head
But i didn't listen to what she said
I kept right on saying

[Chorus]
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys

[Verse 3]
Well, you might have had a last minute fling
But i am sure it didn't mean a thing
Cause yesterday you gave me your ring
And i'm so glad that i kept on saying

Dann kommen die hoffentlich nicht über die Grenzen

Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear

How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake

But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime

So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""

Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""

God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ

Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that

'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me

Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

753,(There'll Come A Day When) Ev'ry Little Bit Hurts,"[Excerpts from Rebel XD’s 1998 Guinness Primetime Episode]

[Verse 1 – Rebel XD (Chopped from P@ND3MIC)]
And I'm abolishing wacks with astonishing raps
That'll complement tracks, In fact
These hacks couldn't follow my act
Even if they had got them an atlas, a compass and map
And tried to match tit for tat the tactics, that I spit
When my raps hit the tracks quick, as if, my lyrics had tricks
Like that of an acrobatic, or some active, bad kids
That were doing back flips from up off of the mattress
And that mixed with a little bit of madness
And magic and mathematics
For calculating the data that I got ta add
Up into all of my raps and beats
Cos when I be making each master piece, or rap classic
I'm making them far surpass average
They're sleeping upon this, it's like they counting sheep
Up under they sheets in pajamas
But at least it'll be keeping them honest
When I be speaking that heat I'm the hottest
Like when the heat peaks in Nevada
So keep trying to bring that beef and that drama
And you'll get eaten alive like you've just reached the Bahamas
And you was eating Mc Donalds while deep in the water
That was full of man eating piranhas!
I'm ma feast upon this beat
And eat it like a piece of red meat
In fact, I'll kill this track so bad
That I'm ma have it like a baby's dad when I'm done
Because it'll become a dead beat
I'm making them bombs drop non stop
And these lyrics that I spit'll harm blocks
Full of niggas like armed cops
Who wanna spawn shots even up in the clam spots
And I'm making them hit rock bottom like bond stocks
That everyone drops, from when a companies funds flopped
You was once tops but then you began to become NOT
Now you sounding like some dumb bot
And anybody who wanna try to respond -STOP!
Cos how can you respond -HOT
When you bums got
Rhymes that sounds like they come
From pawn shop?!?!
Ya bum clot, any rhyme that Rebel'll concoct, it's like a gun cocked
Tis a mega ton Glock coming to pump shots
Making my tongue hot
And making them punks drop and I won't stop
Making them bums flop
And in the meantime when I plan lyrics and this man spit it
Nobody can stand near it or put a hand in it
Because I planned To cause panic to the planet and land, dig it?
It's a pandemic!

[Verse 2 – Union City Love]
Like a pandemic, Ebola, from a while ago it flows from labs from bags. They dragged it down to Africa, blamed the black man, but genocide is before us, see the Guide Stones in Georgia? 500 thou’ the will allow, while they disavow crimes inflicted, none convicted. Let me decrypt the messages, 2030’s asteroid prediction, end of an age, is you tripping? Listen. Too distracted while the diamonds
Glisten, been eating too much packaged piss and let me spit with this master here. Throw my brain in gear while I learn, I yearn to make my mouth burn in tongues we spun to make your ears run. But its all good fun. Expression’s the lesson we blessing. So best turn up the volume, I’m calling you to respond. Pull out the gadgets like James Bond. Smooth, suave, original. Make your mind growl, think hard while we take a bow, this music ain’t for dancing. Like in the olden days, it’s a sit down and listen, is you listening? Things on the radio is flashy show. Right here’s raw technique, daring to speak with the man holding the world title, I’m humbled. I feel slow but I do know that I’ve got a story to show. While I grow, I want to share the Do-Si-Do, a Geronimo with words might sound like a blur if your mind ain’t used to devouring faster than most rap pop tunes. I’ll blast fools in my head because silence is golden. Is your brain done unfolding yet? Is this enough content? I think not. Been letting my brain rot on television, made a decision to get out of that prison. Every step that I take to free the clutter from my mind makes me contemplate society. Are we really this blind? Sounds
Divine, but my mind’s hungry, I need to eat. I want to decipher the technique in the seasoning over this red meat. Looks a little bleak but the longer I listen the more it starts to speak. Story’s lacking, the flow is packing, the man behind the stand is not humble at all but I still got respect because his skill is tall. I want to take a claw to rip the ego out of your rap law, so I can really listen to what you have to say on a day to day instead of being insulted. Is that all you’ve got to say? I’ve got far to go but I want to hear wisdom from that sick flow. You know, I see progress in the things I let happen when I’m under stress. I guess I’ve got a lot to address so please bless me Grandmaster XD, you fresh

[Verse 3 – Rebel XD (Chopped from P@ND3MIC)]
Now if it's a pandemic this damn wicked
Then you better believe
That a man like me got a hand in it, can you handle it?
It'll make you and your band wanna abandon it
And leave you stranded with no fans while you stand in shit
Not understanding it
How can you lose so much to the text of some shit
That a wicked nigga said?
Cos it's a plague, it'll get you dead, it'll get cha brain
It'll get ya fame, it'll get cha spot, it'll get ya chop
It'll get cha props, it'll get cha chains!
But I don't care about things that seems to gleam
Like bling and rings, no doubt
Any rapper that'll seem to doubt
That I'm ma bring you down, is just dreaming now
Cos I'm ma sting your clout!
And there will be no vaccine
Or remedy to get rid of me or help the enemy for when I be
In the vicinity because many be dead on arrival
While there'll be no survival on the rap scene
And if there's a cure for this sickness in which is me
Spittin' my lyrics wicked as witches- forget it
Cos this curse is my gift in which I reverse on each person be first
To catch the pandemic!

Stupid comedian rappers who wanna be lyrical enemies when he be stepping and the veteran and I’m making it bettar and then I’mma let a man step and I’ll get em and I’m aching em up and I’m breaking em then I’m taking em up when I be staking em out of my academy and I’m getting em better and better related with any that wanna be steppin to me when I hit em a kind da dramatical rhyme when I flow at a drop of a dime when I kicking a minimum rap it’ll beat a competitor making em scare of me when I’mma heat em and beat em and seat em and sticking em all when I come and defeat em and I pop em and drop em and I’m coming and mopping em up when I get em and then I’m ma shock em and I’m making them pray when I’m breaking em down with the lyric and I’m and I’m making them follow me

I hit with a script and I’m rippin and picking and I’m trippin em up and they all will be

Stepping away when I come and then give him a kind da incredible dominate rap in a battle and I’m breaking a rapper that’s making a get away when I be coming and attacking and I hack em and backing em up in a pack and I’m racking em up when I get em I got em in check and I’m wrecking em wanna get out of my realm when I’m coming to jam and the rapping eptomie smacking men silly and I’m trapping and a enemy that I’m a slam!

Hit a sucka and I’m waking em up

Kick and breaking em up when I’m taking the mic up into my hand and I’m ma give a lyric and I’m hurt em and wrecking a man and my lyrics are making them wonder why many be thinking of saying its luck when I’m taking a duck and I’m breaking him up when I get him the minute that Rebel erupt!

754,"The Sidewinder, Part 1","I loved Grime from the first time I ever heard wunsaosen
A thousand fans with 100 pound, that's a hundred thousand
There's a lot of sick MCs in the UK, I've been around them
Got a lot of haters along the way, I just allow them

I used to get gassed when I heard Little G say ""there's only one way, and thats the G way""
Shot more tings than eBay
I was teenage but I still get gassed over that these days

And when I heard Remtrex say 'first of all, marijuana is bud, and a G is a thug""
It was over a beat that I love so now I'm like;
Blud, marijuana is ganja, and a G is a gangsta
And a wifey, that's a girl that you pamper, and if you're in the dance you're a skanker
And when I heard Hazman spray at Sidewinder, I was with a girl in the crowd with the black eyeliner
Man was minor but I used to skank get hyper, here's a reminder:

I heard Manny Man say 'went bookies and put a pound on six, what number came H I?'
Everyone in the room could back the ad-libs, I was in the zone like 'that's a madting'
Now I'm at the MOBOs, yo what's happenin?'
I love grime never stopped grafting
See me in the hot-tub with a bad bitch podcasting

I heard D Double E say 'These days the streets are overly warm, don't watch me rudeboy watch porn'
I was in school I was in top form, now I'm 25 years old in top form
Man said ""Why do grime what for?""
Now I'm like 'I love life on tour'

I'm like a pitbull with a lockjaw, I'll spin man
I used to listen to Grim Dan say that he's got no heart like the tin man
If man can't dodge then you better block
Man'll let em off straight through the letterbox and lick man
From '06 when I started to spit fam -- Hitman
Now all the youngers look up to me like a big man
So I just tell em ""you know what it is fam""

'You think you're sick 'til you get kicked out your Birmingham bed'
I used to listen to Midlands Mafia
Same time Chip said ""gal on my Eriksson"" man had one bag of gal on my Nokia
I was a virgin, servin' 'em zeds
Went school in Great Barr, I know some Kingstanding and Erdington heads

Part 1, suck your big fat mum
Part 2, any boy test get slew
Part 3, I used to listen to K Double E and Tempa at the center MC
Like gyaldem shake your bumper down
Then gyaldem shut the bumper down low
Before I rolled with Boy Better Know
Before Smokes was my bro
I used to get down with the graveyard flow like Gio Gio, lets go
Crew at the front say (buh)
Crew at the back say (buh)
Now I'm mighty like Mo
They're liking my flow, the life that I chose is clear
I wanted to be an MC-er
Now I say 'Gio Gio' because my goal is clear
Trust me, man are here

I used to get gassed when I heard MB say 'you ain't been brought up, you've been dragged up, and your mum looks like she's been drugged up""
That shit inspired me to write bars that are fucked up
And if you know about Sox from day, you'll know about Snipecamp and about Young Bloods
Man was Killer Cartel with 25 gal, handguns and nunchucks

Now -- Big man, manna blown up
I bust my nut out of my japs eye into a japs eye 10 minutes after I woke up
And filmed it all on a GoPro, HD 1080p close up
Then sent it to her dad like ""if you don't transfer a bag then a YouPorn video goes up""",Sox,1965,"[87, 81]",2
755,Walking In The Rain,"Sitting by the window
Singing songs of love
Wishing you were here
Because the memory's not enough
Wear my mask in silence
Pretending I'm alright
If you could see then you would be
Here standing by my side

It may be hard to believe
But girl you're the only one I need
It may be hard along the way
It's this feeling I get
When blue skies turn to grey

Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter
'Cause I'm fading away
And baby, I'm walking in the rain

Every single hour
Of every single day
I need to cry, my eyes are dry
I've cried my tears away
Can't help but remember
How you made me feel
You dressed my soul and made me whole
You made my life complete

It may be hard to believe
But girl you're the only one I need
It may be hard along the way
It's this feeling I get
When blue skies turn to grey

Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter
'Cause I'm fading away
And baby, I'm walking in the rain

Of all we've said and done
Remains the memories of days
When life was fun
But now when you are gone
I sit alone to watch the setting of the sun

Feels like I'm walking in the rain
I find myself trying to wash away the pain
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter
'Cause I'm fading away
And baby, I'm walking in the rain

I said baby, I'm walking in the rain",A1 (Band),1965,[36],1

As my pituitary gland sends me on a brutal rampage

웃고 떠들며 바람을 가르자
때론 바보같이 멍청이 달리기
실수와 눈물 속에 we just go

So what
멈춰서 고민 하지마
다 쓸데 없어
Let go
아직은 답이 없지만
You can start the fight

So what
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Somebody call me right one
Somebody call me wrong
난 신경 쓰지 않을래
너도 그럼 어때

So what
멈춰서 고민 하지마
다 쓸데 없어
Let go
아직은 답이 없지만
You can start the fight

So what
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
So what

Somebody call me right one
Somebody call me wrong
난 신경 쓰지 않을래
너도 그럼 어때",BTS,1965,[89],1
764,Maybe,"[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Chea! Ayo!
Ayy, you know what it is, shawty

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti & Teyana Taylor]
Maybe, maybe it's the money, baby, maybe not
Maybe I fell in love with ya on the spot, never lie
I keep it G, I told you that there off the top
Maybe you never met a street nigga thuggin' on the block
And I ain't fuckin' with no thot, shawty
Powerball, this your shot, shawty
And if they hatin' let them talk, shawty
And I been drinking too much, and it got me thinking too much
You in my head, what the fuck?
I say, boy, you done did it, love how you kiss it
Ooh you can get it, I never felt like that before
Ooh, you the realest, yeah, I admit it
All in my feelings

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Had to pause, nigga, wait a minute
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin'
A little cocky, I can deal with that
'Cause you put it down and I need parts of that
Just text your phone, nigga, ""Where you at?""
Give me rounds, I need all of that
Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked
So is you tryna take it down or nah? Or nah?

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
In the club twisted, ooh, reminiscing
Boy, I can vision round two
It's me and you and I'm winning, it's no competition
Boy, you about to, uhh

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Had to pause, nigga, wait a minute
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin'
A little cocky, I can deal with that
'Cause you put it down and I need parts of that
Just text your phone, nigga, ""Where you at?""
Give me rounds, I need all of that
Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked
So is you tryna take it down or nah? Or nah?

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Who she seeing? Who she fucking on the low?
She kissing him, she kissing her, she one of those
Fuck is you? You TMZ, you Sandra Rose
That's little sis, I'm big bro, so let's go
Maybe it's the way I speak it
Know the spot, and how to reach it
When I meet your man, shake his hand
That's I'll keep our little secret
Woo, no pillow talk, no kiss and tell
They countin' coins, my pockets deeper than a wishing well
She like ballers, she like Birkin buyers
She got a wild side, she like dope boys with a certain fire
That's me, nigga, so that's me, nigga
No if, ands, no maybes, so that's oui nigga

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
Ooh, oh, ooh
Maybe I’m in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh, damn
Had to pause, nigga, wait a minute",Teyana Taylor,1965,[91],1
765,Have Mercy Baby,"Have mercy, mercy, baby
I know I've done you wrong
Have mercy, mercy, baby
I know I've done you wrong

My heart is full of sorrow
Take me back where I belong

I've been a good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too
I've been a good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too

From reaping all my sorrow
I don't know what to do

So, have mercy, mercy baby
Tell me, what have I done wrong
Have mercy, mercy, baby
Tell me, what have I done wrong

From reaping all my sorrow
Take me back where I belong
Oh yeah, yeah
Hey, oh yeah

So, have mercy, mercy, baby
I know I've done you wrong
Oh, have mercy, baby
I know I've done you wrong

But my heart is full of sorrow
Take me back where I belong

I've been a good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too
I've been a good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too

From reaping all my sorrow
Tell me what I'm supposed to do",James Brown,1965,[92],1
766,A Little Bit Of Soap,"A little bit of soap will wash
Away the lipstick from my face
A little bit of soap will never
Never, never, ever erase
The pain in my heart and my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap will wash
Away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap will never
Never, never, ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Have you heard
When love begins to die
It leaves someone to cry
Night and day
Like a bird, you left your
Robin's nest and just like
All the rest, you flew away
Mmm, a little bit of soap will
Take away your perfume eventually
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will
Never wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will
Never wash away my tears",Garnet Mimms,1965,[95],1
767,Take This Hurt Off Me,"[Chorus]
Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
I'm too young to be in misery
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting at the bus station
'cause that's where you left me standing
I got my clothes in a twenty-five cent locker
And hear you till that greyhound bring you back again

(chorus)

[Verse 2]
Well, I knocked on my mother's door
She said ""Stevie, come on in
You don't have to say a mumbling word
I know your woman left you again.""

Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
What kind of love could this be?
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I don't know what you've got
I gotta - I gotta - I gotta - yes I have...

(chorus twice)
Yeah ....",The Spencer Davis Group,1965,[97],1
768,Black Night,"Nobody cares about me
I ain't even got a friend
Baby's gone and left me
When will my troubles end?
Black night is falling
Oh how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone
I've got no one to talk with
To tell my troubles to
Don't even know I'm living
Since I lost you
Black night is falling
Oh how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone
[musical interlude]
My mother has the trouble
My father has it too
Brother's in Korea
And I don't know just what to do
Black night, black night is falling
Oh how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone",Charles Brown,1965,[99],1
