0,I'm A Believer,"[Verse 1]
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

[Chorus 1]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer!
I couldn't leave her if I tried

[Verse 2]
I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

[Chorus 1]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed

I couldn't leave her if I tried

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind

1,Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron,"[Verse 1]
After the turn of the century
In the clear blue skies over Germany
Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard
Like the scream and the sound of a big war bird
Up in the sky, a man in a plane
Baron von Richthofen was his name
Eighty men tried, and eighty men died
Now they're buried together on the countryside

[Chorus]
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The Bloody Red Baron was rolling out the score
Eighty men died trying to end that spree
Of the Bloody Red Baron of Germany

[Verse 2]
In the nick of time, a hero arose
A funny-looking dog with a big black nose
He flew into the sky to seek revenge
But the Baron shot him down (Curses, foiled again!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now, Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man
So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan
He challenged the German to a real dogfight
While the Baron was laughing, he got him in his sight

[Musical interlude]

That Bloody Red Baron was in a fix
He'd tried everything, but he'd run out of tricks
Snoopy fired once, and he fired twice
And that Bloody Red Baron went spinning out of sight

[Chorus to fade]",The Royal Guardsmen,1966,"[2, 7, 30]",3
2,Winchester Cathedral,"{Whistling opening}

Winchester Cathedral
You're bringing me down
You stood and you watched as
My baby left town
You could have done something
But you didn't try
You didn't do nothing
You let her walk by
Now everyone knows just how much I needed that gal
She wouldn't have gone far away
If only you'd started ringing your bell

3,That's Life,"[Verse 1]
That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks, stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinning around

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 2]
That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

[Outro]
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die

4,Sugar Town,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm on my way, on my way to Hell
Burnt up a dog, and got away with it
But some of them say that's where the Lord kicks in, but I say:

[Chorus]
How hard does he kick then, huh?
Uh, you know he better kick me good
I'm off to Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Sugar Town

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm on my way, on my way to Hell
But I think I'll live for a few more days
And just when I think that it's time to go, I say:

[Chorus]
Hell only exists if you believe in God, right?
So, that makes me a ghost when I die, right?
I call that Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Sugar Town

But I say: How hard does he kick then, huh?
Uh, you know he better kick me good

6,Tell It Like It Is,"[Produced by Omen]

[Karma] Daddy is that your car on TV?

[Ludacris]
You better believe it is baby
Now go in the other room
It's about to be some grown folks talkin here, okay?
All right

Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be (okay)
Like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry (tell 'em!)
Talkin 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name? (woo!)
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session (okay)
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession (hey!)
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya about a grand so start savin your change (DTP!)
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps (uh-huh)
Sign yourself TO yourself and start signin ya own checks (woo!)
Hit the booth and start recordin at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowin, could be speed or weed (what else?)
Get it mixed and mastered (hey) pressed up and plastered (okay)
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be (hey!)
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me!

[Hook: Ludacris]
But I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
See mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems (yup)
Their money could be the problem but money can't solve 'em (nope)
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy (woo)
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy (woo!)
I'm close cause those close wanna live off my fame (yup)
And that type of shit ALONE'll drive a nigga insane (crazy!)
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandalous promoters (okay)
Crabs'll try to sue you, magazines'll misquote ya
Most of these label heads, they don't care nothin about ya (nah)
If you stop sellin records they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixin business with pleasure so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other DAY (for real!)
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass (true that)
All that, and this is really just the start of it (just the start of it)
Hip-Hop! You really wanna be a part of it?

[Hook: Ludacris]
Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is

Let's go!
What's worse than havin no money is havin it and losin it (yup)
What's worse than havin some money is grabbin and abusin it (yup)
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool with him (nah)
I wish his ass well but I don't want NOTHIN to do with him (woo!)
Some don't own they publishin; me? I never fool with 'em (nah)
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em (believe it)
Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant (DTP!)
Unless I'm still in competition with my president (what up Jay?)
And believe that I'm supportin the Hova
Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over (okay!)
But the first rule to accumulation of wealth (what's that?)
Is don't trust nobody but your GOD damned self!

[Hook: Ludacris]
Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
Man this biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is

7,(I Know) I'm Losing You,"[Intro]
Your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', woman I feel it fade

[Verse 1]
Ah, woman, woman your touch, your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooh babe, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's there everywhere
Baby, baby, babe, I'm losing you

[Verse 2]
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face, I see
I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me
It's all over your face
Someone's takin' my place
Ooh baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness you feel inside
Ooh babe, I'm losing you

[Verse 3]
I can't bear the thought of losing you
Ah woman, can't you see what I'm goin' through
I'm losin' my mind, losin' my mind
And it's all because of you
I can't bear the thought of losing you
I'm losin' my mind, losin' my mind
And it's all because of you

8,A Place In The Sun,"[Verse 1]
Like a long lonely stream
I keep running towards a dream
Moving on, moving on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reaching to be free
Moving on, moving on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

[Verse 2]
Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on, moving on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on, moving on

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

[Bridge]
You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run

Company, I don't need it

I'm just good on my own, so good on my own

Somebody who changes my mind

The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me

Yeah, I already done everything I dream
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing

[Verse 2]
I make myself up
Just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home
I pose and take pictures
Then send them to people that I don't know
I like getting compliments
Complements how I'm feeling, oh
I'm not always selfish
Just bad at romance, it's not in my bones

I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home

Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But, tell them if I don't survive

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 2]
Free, like a river raging
Strong as the wind I’m facing
Chasing dreams and racing father time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can’t see my heart you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can’t keep no chains on me

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 3]
And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Calm, facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free!
I was born free, born free

And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats itself
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me

A dark cloud covered my heart
Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

No matter how strong a man is
Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart

A lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Because I've passed this way before

Paths of dark and light

Swinging down the street so fancy free
Nobody you meet could ever see the loneliness there
Inside of you

Why do all the boys just pass you by
Could it be you don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear

You're always window shopping but
Never stopping to buy
So shed those downy feathers and fly

There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And oh what a dream may be
The world would be
A new Georgy girl

But there's a reality
You can't always run away

Don't be so scared of changing
And rearranging yourself

Its time for jumping out of your chair

Bring out all the love you hide
And oh what a dream may be

Color my world with a pen and a tablet
I do it on a daily, it’s a habit
Open your eyes, your life is in jeopardy
But we wanna play games just like Jeopardy or
Wheel Of Fortune so tell me what’s your fortune
You wanna sell your soul, what’s your life is really worth then?
But not me, I think I need to shift it
Give my words to you because I’m gifted
Feels like I’m lifted, I’m high on life
Not tryna live yours, I live my own life
I, color my world with the words I say
Feel like Faith Evans, I’m hopeful today
I walk my own path with a pen and a backpack
They wanna sleep on me, well here’s a knapsack
The future’s scary ‘cause you can’t predict it
And you can change it but you gonna have to fix it

Color my world with the words I say
I speak light, turn night to the day

Did you know I’m Picasso with a pen?
The sky blew me to you, no wind
Situation if you keep losing
All because the path that you choosing
If your skies gray, then I’ll turn ‘em blue
All you gotta do is call and I’m there for you
Pray all the flow colder than a polar
Bear, I’m there when you think no one cares
We got global warming but the world’s so cold
And how did that happen? I do not know
Yeah people change when you had a lot of pain
But sunshine is bright, what you waiting on the rain?
Umbrella for a Cinderella with no
Slipper, tell me how black and whites differ
You can’t, ‘cause we still the same people
One plus one, two, we equal

Color my world with the words I say
I speak light, turn night to the day

[Verse 3]
This life, got you looking in the mirror now
Tryna wipe away the smears, see it clearer now
‘cause you want the good life like they make it seem on the screen
But it’s really not the same, it’s a shame but
I swear it’s the facts and now
Everything is piling on you in stacks
Like the stacks you see with these rappers on Earth but
No amount can compare to what your life worth
Think about it
As kids with no food in the tummy
Now realize your life ain’t that crummy
And I really hope that you get this
Life can get grizzly, I’m tryna bear witness
‘cause you’re meant for something much greater
And you will get there, sooner or later
Thought comes to mind when I look at the skies
Look with your heart, you can’t see with your eyes
‘cause it’s more to see than what you’re looking at
And it gets hard, but that’s only if you’re looking back

That's only if you’re looking back
That's only if you’re looking back",SkyBlew,1966,"[38, 69]",2

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright

Down by the riverside's
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again
Look around

The fields are ripe
It's the spring time of my life
Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry

At any convenient time?

53,I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night),"Last night your shadow fell upon my lonely room
I touched your golden hair and tasted your perfume
Your eyes were filled with love the way they used to be
Your gentle hand reached out to comfort me
Then came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone, gone, gone

I had too much to dream last night
Too much to dream
I'm not ready to face the light
I had too much to dream
Last night

The room was empty as I staggered from my bed
I could not bear the image racing through my head
You were so real that I could feel your eagerness
And when you raised your lips for me to kiss

Came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone, gone, gone

Oh, too much to dream
Oh, too much to dream
Too much to dream last night
Oh, too much to dream",The Vibrators,1966,"[54, 68, 81, 98]",4
54,Bad Misunderstanding,"(Joan Jett/Jim Vallance/Kenny Laguna)

I got a word or two cuz I don't understand
What's with me and you it's getting outta hand
Somethin's on your mind, you don't have to shout
Why can't we just talk and figure this thing out

I used to think that you and me would stay together
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?

You make me come with you and then you give me grief
When I try to go you never let me leave
If I shut my mouth you think that I don't care
When I try to help you say it's your affair

It's not the way that you and me should treat each other
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?

It's breakin' my heart we're grown' apart
An' we never seem to agree
I'm walkin' away we got nothin' to say
But that ain't the way it should be be
(We're history!)

It's such a drag we have this bad misunderstanding
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?",Joan Jett & The Blackhearts,1966,"[55, 58, 64, 77, 100]",5

56,Ghost Riders In The Sky,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky
And up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry

Yippie-yi-yaaaaay
Yippie-yi-ohhhhh
Ghost riders in the sky
Yippie-yi-yaaaaay
Yippie-yi-ohhhhh
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on, hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd
Across these endless skies""

Yippie-yi-yaaaaay
Yippie-yi-ohhhhh
Ghost riders in the sky
Yippie-yi-yaaaaay

Blue and black times

On which we can agree
When you're ailing darlin' you can lean on me

And the love I bring
Will grow into a lasting thing
Put your heart on wings
That set you free
And as you rise
Up into the clearing skies
Maybe you will realize
You can lean on me

Are hidden deep inside

How do you catch a girl?

Take a little piece of cheese and put it on a trap

And you're bound to catch a fish if you're calm enough to wait

But how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?

Daniel Boone took a rifle and a coonskin cap
And he found an icy river and he set a little trap

But how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?

I'd like to know how to catch a girl
I've caught frogs, I've caught snakes, earthworms
And they may be nice
But girls, oh

Well, I asked the local lover and he told me what to do
He said learn the rocking dances both old and new
But it's hard to do those dances with two left feet
So I've got to find a method that'll work for me

Oh, how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?

63,Look What You've Done,"[Produced by Chase N. Cashe and Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you...",Drake,1966,"[64, 79, 98]",3

And who now makes my bed
Who now lies beside me
Who now holds my head
Who knows all my thoughts
And every word I say ...

As I looked into the mirror, yesterday

Whose voice did I hear when bells where ringin'
Silent bird that started singin' … yesterday

Oh, my darlin, don't deny me."" Yesterday

Who now shares my time
And who now makes my bed
Who now lies beside me

69,Knight In Rusty Armour,"Long ago in days of old
There lived a knight who
Wasn't quite as bold
As a knight should be

He rode an old grey mare called Bess
Searchin' for a damsel in distress
Just to see if he
Could set her free

See the knight in rusty armour ride
To her aid
Trusty sword is hanging at his side
With a rusty blade

Up the tower steps he sneaked
But as he moved
His rusty armour squeaked
Such a mournful note

And all the sentries at their posts
Thought it must have been the castle ghost
They jumped for their lives
In the moat

So the knight in rusty armour won
His fair maid
Had no need to draw his trusty sword
With a rusty blade

As he bent to kiss his bride
He found that he was rusted up inside
In his battle dress
And I can't guess

How they still got married and had twins
They came in tins
Every suit of armour ever made has a kink
Chainmail pants with a missing link",Peter & Gordon,1966,"[71, 86]",2

71,Another Night,"[Intro]
Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm
I'm just a regular kid, at my crib
Doin' regular shit, burnin' 5 spliffs
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'm a pour another cup and roll another zone
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me, hit me on Twitter
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name
Waitin' at the station till it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin bout
Pour a little liquor then I drink it down

[Hook]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank god for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gate
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and
Burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do it's nothin' new

[Hook]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone",Mac Miller,1966,"[73, 75]",2
72,"Green, Green Grass Of Home","[Verse 1: Elvis Presley]
The old hometown looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus:  Elvis Presley]
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
All creatures smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Verse 2:  Elvis Presley]
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus:  Elvis Presley]
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Verse 3:  Elvis Presley]
Then I awake and look around me
Four gray walls surround me
And I realize I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus:  Elvis Presley]
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home",Elvis Presley,1966,"[74, 76]",2
73,Just One Smile,"[Intro]
Can't I cry a little bit?
There's nobody to notice it
Can't I cry if I want to?
No one cared

[Verse 1]
Why can't I pretend
That you loved me again?
All I've had has been taken from me
Now I'm crying and my tears don't become me

[Chorus]
Just one smile, the pain's forgiven
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my life worth living
A little dream to build my world upon

[Verse 2]
How I wish I could say
All the things that I want to say
If some way you could see what's in my heart
I don't ask for much, a look, a smile, a touch
Try to forget, Lord knows I'm trying
But it's hard to forget when your whole world is dying

Just one smile, the pain's forgiven
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my life worth living
A little dream to build my world upon

Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
When the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the nightbird song
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees that worship the wind
And if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room filled with empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til your next hello
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes, that I love so much

But if you go, I won't cry

The mercury is dropping down to minus ten below
Outside it's chilling but inside it's thrilling
With fireplaces burning and records that keep turning

Gone is the green grass the trees have turned brown
The sky has gone gray, it's now winter's day
The parks they are empty, no squeaks from the swings
No kids are at play, it's now winter's day

And here we are snuggled warm in each others arms
Listening to silent sound as the snow packs the ground
Perfumed hair that I smell, essence that I like so well

You are my winter, the days and the nights
In our hideaway, its now winter's day
Our love will grow stronger a minute has chilled
Inside we will play, it's now winter's day

108,Holy Cow,"Verse 1 - Cinco:

I don't need you (Uh)
But I want you (And)
Not gonna hunt you (Uh)
I'm gonna haunt you (Damn)
And, yeah, I'm drawn to (Uh)
What I cannot attain
And everything that I explain
Is just me spitting game
See, I am not like other people
Nosediving from the top of a steeple
I'm ducking and dodging the evil
But all of my attempts seem feeble
Thread that needle... Impossible
Hallucinate my obstacles
Success, it is improbable
Because they feed us all a lot of bull
And we eat it
Bite the hand that's feeding
We're bred to ask no reason
Til the day that we cease our breathing
So don't question, just believe it
You better break yourself from that mold right now
And we hold shit down with a bold-ass sound
Me and BKnitts style like holy cow (x3)

Verse 2 - BKnitts:

Holy cow, I'm hungry. Ate a burger out in Budapest
Hella turkey waiting out in Istanbul, I'm shooting West
Chuck a brain against the wall. It's pretty much the noodle test
My flows cold, dog - take some Sudafed, I'll do the rest
You can bet the dude is stressed
But never clutching to a bottle, there's
About a billion thoughts to bare, I'm witnessing you're not aware
You're victim to the plot of their... mind eaters...
This rap game is like solitaire mixed with minesweeper
I'll let that sink in
I could blow at any minute if I think and play my cards right
Banging like a carbine but treat it like a part time
Locked up on a dark night. Saving sonnets in my archive
Anthropomorphic like The Far Side
Another white rapper from the burbs? What a hard life
Every time I spit I sit back to watch the bar rise
It's mine
I'm from a city where it snows in the spring time
So I'm spending most of my days on the inside
Toe tapping to tracks tip toeing over thin ice
Then getting sucked under by depression like a riptide
Look behind his eyes. There's more than meets the retina
I'm a firm believer in believing in a zealot
I think it's wise to listen to the man that never says much
A child of the world there ain't no point in throwing sets up
Contemplating peep the plate upon my conscience
Floating in the ether - could have swore I was beyond it
Reaching out to thoughts quick. Speaking like I'm Gandhi
Wishing for connection to the people that surround me
I know the concepts strange
Just wanna help you believe
And if I can't make a change
Maybe there ain't room for me",BKnitts,1966,"[38, 23, 34, 32, 34, 46, 65, 82, 85]",9
109,The Wheel Of Hurt,"You're gonna know what it means to be lonely
You're gonna know what it meants to be blue
You're gonna know how it feels to feel your heart breaking in two
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
You're gonna cry little tears someday maybe
I'll hear you say you're sorry we're through
But I'll be the first one to help you cause you need someone that's true
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
You're gonna learn the truth the hard way and when you do you'll always know
It's bad luck to hurt somebody when that somebody loves you so
It may be today or it may be tomorrow you'll have to pay when you're payment is due

While you out there ballin, tryin to have it the kingpin way

You leaves out the house everytime you get a beep
To all you ladies, sweet dark and lovely
See players like me, I likes to taste the Easter bunny
I likes to lick you down, give you self esteem
I'm the playboy you want, on your under team

Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

[Verse 2]
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

[Verse 3]
I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

[Chorus]
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

[Verse 4]
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

[Chorus]
Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care

[Outro]
I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now

When love brings so much joy, why must it bring such pain?
Guess it's a mystery that nobody can explain

While holding my pillow tight
Then you came into my lonely days
With your tender and your sweet ways
Now I don't know where you come from, baby
Don't know where you've been, my baby
Heaven must have sent you, honey
Into my arms
Now in the mornin' when I awake
There's a smile on my face
You've touched my heart with gladness
Wiped away all my sadness
So long I've needed love right near me
A soft voice to cheer me
Heaven must have sent you, baby
Into my life
It's heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I wanna stay
Wanna thank you for the joy you brought me
Thank you for the things you taught me
Thank you for holding me close

I'll prolly never even tell myself

143,Look Through My Window,"And the rain beats on my roof
And it does not ask for proof

It's not that lovers are unkind
She always said there'd come a time
When one would leave and one stay behind

We both knew people sometimes change
And lovers sometimes rearrange
And nothing's quite as sure as change

And the rain beats on my roof

Look through my window to the street below
See the people hurryin' by
With someone to meet, some place to go
And I know I should let go

She always said ""I'm not like you""
""When love is dead, for me it's through""
""And I will find and love someone new""

Look through my window, yeah, to the street below
See the people hurryin' by
With someone to meet, some place to go
And I know I should let go

I must admit she knew her mind
And it will not take her long to find
Another place where the sun will shine

And the rain beats on my roof
If I still require proof
Well, the rain beats on my roof (She's gone)
If I still require proof (She's gone)
Well, the rain beats on my roof (Look through my window)
If I still require proof (All the people)

When he thinks that you've had enough

To any one of my wants or needs
No matter how my poor heart bleeds

163,Behind The Door,"[Verse 1]
Take me to the magic land
Wake up here without a fear, float towards the troposphere
I be sitting on a cloud
In the bubble like a bee buzzing in it's honey tree
Medication helps the fixation
I see a land I knew so well
Everything seems stayed the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
I can't see no mist no more
Behind the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
The lake of love which I adore

[Chorus]
Control, where are you hiding now?
Shadows won't let me go!

[Verse 2]
Take me to the magic land!
Flower being in-front of me, summer rain above the sea
How can I go back again?
Look beneath the memories, climb up to the highest tree
Medication King Adulation
You flew so high but hovered when

[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
I can't see the mist no more
Behind the door
Where's the colour? The colour?
The lake of love which I adore

[Chorus]
Control, where are you hiding now?
Shadows won't let me go

[Bridge]
Why can't I sprout some kind of wings and
Fly up high past cloud up there I see
Leave this damn mirror for a while and just
Try and get along with myself a bit better

I can see there's something wrong
I thought I'd say goodbye
Is there a missing page, that I can never turn?

You can't find the light when you wake in a well
You couldn't see what's right in front of you 'til you fell
Hold on to hope someday you might find
A flower being so bright to make the entire world shine

Do we sail through waves nobody knows?
Do we sail beyond the sky now?

[Verse 3]
Take me to the magic land!
Take me to the magic land!
I'll be sitting on a cloud
I'll be sitting on a cloud
Medication helps the fixation
I see a land I knew so well

[Pre-Chorus]
Behind the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
I can't see the mist no more
Behind the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
The lake of love which I adore",SikTh,1966,[97],1

Said he went for a job

Without an education
You might as well be dead
Now don't get me wrong
He said, it's not who you are
But people come to me
From near and far
But I do just what
And I follow the rules
I didn't have an education
So I had to go back to school

That he loved so well
And of their personal troubles
I will not tell
Now those guys didn't seem good
And they didn't seem bad
They didn't seem so happy
And I know they weren't sad
But the point isn't
That they follow the rules
They got an education
And they all been in school
Now underneath his tears
I could see the true fact
When he dropped out of school
He never, never went back

You gotta, gotta listen now now
What he said
Without an education
You might as well be dead
Look here

[Verse 3]
So one day he got tired
Of his little spending change
So he looked up his friends
To check their pay range
When he got there, the crib
He found that he was a drag
Because man, they were clean
And his clothes were like rags
One was a business man
With plenty of dough
He had his thing so set up
You know he couldn't blow
The other had his job so uptight
He had his whole family
And his kids all out of sight

Without an education
Might as well be dead
You got to, got to, got to get a little learning
What he said
Without an education
Might as well be dead

What made him so hurt
That these were his friends and he was a drag
They looked at him
And he was in the same old bag
For his friends they worked real hard
When the work day was through
Now, he realized
He should have done the same thing too

Tell me one more time now, looka here

For the last time, I'm gonna say
They kept on pushing
When the going was tough
And now they know
That things don't seem so rough
So kids, stay in school
Don't be no drag
Take a fool's advise
And stay out of that bag

To paint a mother and child

To wake up the sun

But these wondrous things
Ain't got what it takes
To make two hearts beat as one

And one magic moment
To know they're in heaven
It takes a man and a woman
To feel what we’re feelin'
And ain't it a miracle
That you'd take a woman like me
To love a man like you

River to flow
Just take something up
To catch you a rainbow
And if you got sometime
And a ladder to climb
You’ll find the rainbows end

Well it just takes some notes
To write a song
La-la-la-la, to sing along
But since Adam and Eve
When feelings get strong
To do what comes naturally

It takes a man and a woman
And one magic moment
To know their in heaven
It takes a man and a woman
To feel what we’re feelin'
And ain't it a miracle
That you’d take a woman like me
To love a man like you

It takes a man and a woman
And one magic moment
To know their in heaven
It takes a man and a woman
To feel what we’re feelin’
And ain't it a miracle
That you’d take a woman like me
To love a man like you

Take a woman like me
To love a man like you...",Sarah Geronimo,1966,"[88, 88]",2
177,It's Not The Same,"[Verse 1]
I'll keep the pictures saved in a safe place
Wow, I look so weird here
My face has changed now
It's a big shame
So many feelings, struggling to leave my mouth
And it's not that rare for me to let myself down
In a big way
But I had enough time and I found enough reason to accept that

[Chorus]
It's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same, but it's not a shame 'cause

[Verse 2]
I spend a long time putting up with people
Putting on my best face
It's only normal when you stop things in the wrong way
It's only four o'clock and still, it's been a long day
I just wanna hit the hay
People knocking on me like every day
I'm tired of taking stress
If only there could be another way
I'm tired of feeling suppressed
And when they want me the most
I'm tired of acting like I care, but I do
And I can't wait to hit the bed
But tomorrow makes me scared

[Chorus]
'Cause it's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course (Of course)
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore (It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same anymore (It's not the same)
(It's not the same)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
Oh-oh

[Verse 3]
I kept the feelings inside
I open up when shit gets built up this high
She makes it easy to cry
The words fall out of me and there's no more disguise
I miss the days when I was someone else
I used to be so hungry
Right now, my stomach's full as hell
And I've spent many months just hating on myself
I can't keep wishing things will be different
Or leaving problems on the shelf
I wish I didn't need to get help
But I do
But I do
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 4]
I been so hard on myself, yeah
Even my family can tell
And they barely saw what I felt
I wouldn't wish this on my enemy or anyone else

[Chorus]
It's not the same
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same as before
It's not the same anymore
And it's fine because

[Verse 5]
I've learned so much from before
Now I'm not short on advice
There's no excuses at all
No point in feeling upset
Won't take my place on the floor
I'll stand up straight like I'm tall
It's up to me, no one else
I'm doing this for myself
It's not the same anymore
It's better
It got better
It's not the same anymore
It's better
Yeah, yeah

179,Theme From The Wild Angels,"Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
It's a miracle in itself

Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

Well it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
And we still break each other's heart sometimes
Spend some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms

181,A Satisfied Mind,"[Pre-Chorus]
How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way

[Chorus]
But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind

[Verse]
Once I was winning
In fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for
To get a start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened
I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back
Your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind

When my life has ended
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind

182,Little Man,"[Verse 1: Slug]
Dear Jacob
I won't take up too much of you time
I know you're trying to get your video game-grind on
And that's fine
Just gimme a second to empty my face
Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase
I've been watching you and
I'm proud of you man
You're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can
I know you understand
Why I go out of town
I also know my days are colder when you're not around
Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact
That daddy never lived inside the same shack
And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit
It's what I get
I'm convinced it's my punishment
For those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar
In some city with some people I don't know
For all the times that the lines on your face
Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped
It trips me out how you pick up all my traits
From the way that you spit to the fists that you make
I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy
Daddy learned that from you
You're supposed to learn that from daddy
I can't teach much when it comes to women
I drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine
You're doing good little man that's all I really meant
I love you
You're my best friend, thanks for listening

[Verse 2: Slug]
Dear Craig, what up bones? How it goes?
Yeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old
Sorry that the phone calls ain't too routine
Just been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing
Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast
And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed
Other times I'm not sittin' on enough cash
And other times today feels too much like the past
Sometimes at night I would watch y'all fight
A child wonderin'
Why your life just ain't alright?
What's the violence about? Why's it in my house?
And even the memories are turned up too loud
Yeah, I got some issues in my head
Knew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you
I'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now
But your little man just wants you to listen now
I'm over 30, can't maintain relations
All these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience
I can't trust them, and they're not much help
When they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself
What pride, fists, and words just might do?
I'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you
I've never hit a woman
I won't do coke
And for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man

[Verse 3: Slug]
Dear Sean, what's going on? Not much to say
Just checkin' in with you, trying to see what's wrong today
I know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises
How's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?
Got a lot to lose, it's breaking your shoulders
So you let your paranoia place your bets for you
Too many cigarettes, messing up your voice
Too many arguments, trying to test your poise
The only women that love you are fans and family
Mom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly
No heavy rotation in any location
You're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation
Plus you're getting old, your raps are exhausted
Stop it, everybody knows that you've lost it
Singing for these kids you don't know
When you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone
Fighting with your girl like it's you against the world
Another drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus
Come and save him Jesus
Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas
Sometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done
And love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone
Your son says, ""Hi dad"", your dad says, ""What's up?""
And me, I wanna thank you, but I won't, I'll just say, ""Good luck.""",Atmosphere,1966,"[44, 35, 21, 23, 28, 43, 72]",7

Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

200,Almost Persuaded No. 2,"""Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."" Acts 26:28.

AND many there are who go thus far: ever since the Christian religion was in the world, there have been many in every age and nation who were almost persuaded to be Christians. But seeing it avails nothing before God to go only thus far, it highly imports us to consider,

First. What is implied in being almost,

Secondly. What in being altogether, a Christian.

I. (I.) 1. Now, in the being almost a Christian is implied, First, heathen honesty. No one, I suppose, will make any question of this; especially, since by heathen honesty here, I mean, not that which is recommended in the writings of their philosophers only, but such as the common heathens expected one of another, and many of them actually practised. By the rules of this they were taught that they ought not to be unjust; not to take away their neighbour's goods, either by robbery or theft; not to oppress the poor, neither to use extortion toward any; not to cheat or overreach either the poor or rich, in whatsoever commerce they had with them; to defraud no man of his right; and, if it were possible, to owe no man anything.

2. Again: the common heathens allowed, that some regard was to be paid to truth, as well as to justice. And, accordingly, they not only held him in abomination who was forsworn, who called God to witness to a lie; but him also who was known to be a slanderer of his neighbour, who falsely accused any man. And indeed, little better did they esteem wilful liars of any sort, accounting them the disgrace of human kind, and the pests of society.

3. Yet again: there was a sort of love and assistance which they expected one from another. They expected whatever assistance any one could give another, without prejudice to himself. And this they extended not only to those little offices of humanity which are performed without any expense or labour, but likewise to the feeding the hungry, if they had food to spare; the clothing the naked with their own superfluous raiment; and, in general. the giving, to any that needed, such things as they needed not themselves. Thus far, in the lowest account of it, heathen honesty went; the first thing implied in the being almost a Christian.

(II.) 4. A second thing implied in the being almost a Christian, is, the having a form of godliness; of that godliness which is prescribed in the gospel of Christ; the having the outside of a real Christian. Accordingly, the almost Christian does nothing which the gospel forbids. he taketh not the name of God in vain; he blesseth, and curseth not; he sweareth not at all, but his communication is, yea, yea; nay, nay. he profanes not the day of the Lord, nor suffers it to be profaned, even by the stranger that is within his gates. he not only avoids all actual adultery, fornication, and uncleanness, but every word or look that either directly or indirectly tends thereto; nay, and all idle words, abstaining both from detraction, backbiting, talebearing, evil speaking, and from ""all foolish talking and jesting""--eutrapelia, a kind of virtue in the heathen moralist's account; --briefly, from all conversation that is not ""good to the use of edifying,' and that, consequently, ""grieves the Holy Spirit of God, whereby we are sealed to the day of redemption.'

5. He abstains from ""wine wherein is excess'; from revellings and gluttony. he avoids, as much as in him lies, all strife and contention, continually endeavouring to live peaceably with all men. And, if he suffer wrong, he avengeth not himself, neither returns evil for evil. he is no railer, no brawler, no scoffer, either at the faults or infirmities of his neighbour. he does not willingly wrong, hurt, or grieve any man; but in all things act and speaks by that plain rule, ""Whatsoever thou wouldest not he should do unto thee, that do not thou to another.""

6. And in doing good, he does not confine himself to cheap and easy offices of kindness, but labours and suffers for the profit of many, that by all means he may help some. In spite of toil or pain, ""whatsoever his hand findeth to do, he doeth it with his might;"" whether it be for his friends, or for his enemies; for the evil, or for the good. For being ""not slothful"" in this, or in any ""business,"" as he ""hath opportunity"" he doeth ""good,"" all manner of good, ""to all men;"" and to their souls as well as their bodies. he reproves the wicked, instructs the ignorant, confirms the wavering, quickens the good, and comforts the afflicted. he labours to awaken those that sleep; to lead those whom God hath already awakened to the ""Fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness,"" that they may wash therein and be clean; and to stir up those who are saved through faith, to adorn the gospel of Christ in all things.

7. He that hath the form of godliness uses also the means of grace; yea, all of them, and at all opportunities. he constantly frequents the house of God; and that, not as the manner of some is, who come into the presence of the Most High, either loaded with gold and costly apparel, or in all the gaudy vanity of dress, and either by their unseasonable civilities to each other, or the impertinent gaiety of their behaviour, disclaim all pretensions to the form as well as to the power of godliness. Would to God there were none even among ourselves who fall under the same condemnation! who come into this house, it may be, gazing about, or with all the signs of the most listless, careless indifference, though sometimes they may seem to use a prayer to God for his blessing on what they are entering upon; who, during that awful service, are either asleep, or reclined in the most convenient posture for it; or, as though they supposed God was asleep, talking with one another, or looking round, as utterly void of employment. Neither let these be accused of the form of godliness. No; he who has even this, behaves with seriousness and attention, in every part of that solemn service. More especially, when he approaches the table of the Lord, it is not with a light or careless behaviour, but with an air, gesture, and deportment which speaks nothing else but ""God be merciful to me a sinner!""

8. To this, if we add the constant use of family prayer, by those who are masters of families, and the setting times apart for private addresses to God, with a daily seriousness of behaviour; he who uniformly practises this outward religion, has the form of godliness. There needs but one thing more in order to his being almost a Christian, and that is, sincerity.

(III.) 9. By sincerity I mean, a real, inward principle of religion, from whence these outward actions flow. And, indeed if we have not this, we have not heathen honesty; no, not so much of it as will answer the demand of a heathen Epicurean poet. Even this poor wretch, in his sober intervals, is able to testify,

Oderunt peccare boni, virtutis amore;

Oderunt peccare mali, formidine poenae.

[Good men avoid sin from the love of virtue; Wicked men avoid sin from a fear of punishment.]

So that, if a man only abstains from doing evil in order to avoid punishment, Non pasces in cruce corvos, [Thou shalt not be hanged.], saith the Pagan; there, ""thou hast thy reward."" But even he will not allow such a harmless man as this to be so much as a good heathen. If, then, any man, from the same motive, viz., to avoid punishment, to avoid the loss of his friends, or his gain, or his reputation, should not only abstain from doing evil, but also do ever so much good; yea, and use all the means of grace; yet we could not with any propriety say, this man is even almost a Christian. If he has no better principle in his heart, he is only a hypocrite altogether.

10. Sincerity, therefore, is necessarily implied in the being almost a Christian; a real design to serve God, a hearty desire to do his will. It is necessarily implied, that a man have a sincere view of pleasing God in all things; in all his conversation; in all his actions; in all he does or leaves undone. This design, if any man be almost a Christian, runs through the whole tenor of his life. This is the moving principle, both in his doing good, his abstaining from evil, and his using the ordinances of God.

11. But here it will probably be inquired, ""Is it possible that any man living should go so far as this, and, nevertheless, be only almost a Christian What more than this, can be implied in the being a Christian altogether I answer, First, that it is possible to go thus far, and yet be but almost a Christian, I learn, not only from the oracles of God, but also from the sure testimony of experience.

12. Brethren, great is ""my boldness towards you in this behalf."" And ""forgive me this wrong,"" if I declare my own folly upon the house-top, for yours and the gospel's sake. --Suffer me, then, to speak freely of myself, even as of another man. I am content to be abased, so ye may be exalted, and to be yet more vile for the glory of my Lord.

13. I did go thus far for many years, as many of this place can testify; using diligence to eschew all evil, and to have a conscience void of offence; redeeming the time; buying up every opportunity of doing all good to all men; constantly and carefully using all the public and all the private means of grace; endeavouring after a steady seriousness of behaviour, at all times, and in all places; and, God is my record, before whom I stand, doing all this in sincerity; having a real design to serve God; a hearty desire to do his will in all things; to please him who had called me to ""fight the good fight,"" and to ""lay hold of eternal life."" Yet my own conscience beareth me witness in the Holy Ghost, that all this time I was but almost a Christian.

II. If it be inquired, ""What more than this is implied in the being altogether a Christian"" I answer,

(I.) 1. First. The love of God. For thus saith his word, ""Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength."" Such a love is this, as engrosses the whole heart, as rakes up all the affections, as fills the entire capacity of the soul and employs the utmost extent of all its faculties. he that thus loves the Lord his God, his spirit continually ""rejoiceth in God his Saviour."" his delight is in the Lord, his Lord and his All, to whom ""in everything he giveth thanks. All his desire is unto God, and to the remembrance of his name."" his heart is ever crying out, ""Whom have I in heaven but Thee and there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee."" Indeed, what can he desire beside God Not the world, or the things of the world: for he is ""crucified to the world, and the world crucified to him."" he is crucified to ""the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of life."" Yea, he is dead to pride of every kind: for ""love is not puffed up"" but ""he that dwelling in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,"" is less than nothing in his own eyes.

(II.) 2. The Second thing implied in the being altogether a Christian is, the love of our neighbour. For thus said our Lord in the following words, ""Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" If any man ask, ""Who is my neighbour"" we reply, Every man in the world; every child of his who is the Father of the spirits of all flesh. Nor may we in any wise except our enemies or the enemies of God and their own souls. But every Christian loveth these also as himself, yea, ""as Christ loved us."" he that would more fully understand what manner of love this is, may consider St. Paul's description of it. It is ""long-suffering and kind."" It ""envieth not."" It is not rash or hasty in judging. It ""is not puffed up;"" but maketh him that loves, the least, the servant of all. Love ""doth not behave itself unseemly,"" but becometh ""all things to all men."" She ""seeketh not her own;"" but only the good of others, that they may be saved. ""Love is not provoked."" It casteth out wrath, which he who hath is wanting in love. ""It thinketh no evil. It rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth. It covereth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.""

(III.) 3. There is yet one thing more that may be separately considered, though it cannot actually be separate from the preceding, which is implied in the being altogether a Christian; and that is the ground of all, even faith. Very excellent things are spoken of this throughout the oracles of God. ""Every one, saith the beloved disciple, ""that believeth is born of God."" ""To as many as received him, gave he power to become the sons of God. even to them that believe on his name."" And ""this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."" Yea, our Lord himself declares, ""He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and cometh not into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life.""

4. But here let no man deceive his own soul. ""It is diligently to be noted, the faith which bringeth not forth repentance, and love, and all good works, is not that right living faith, but a dead and devilish one. For, even the devils believe that Christ was born of a virgin: that he wrought all kinds of miracles, declaring himself very God: that, for our sakes, he suffered a most painful death, to redeem us from death everlasting; that he rose again the third day: that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father and at the end of the world shall come again to judge both the quick and dead. These articles of our faith the devils believe, and so they believe all that is written in the Old and New Testament. And yet for all this faith, they be but devils. They remain still in their damnable estate lacking the very true Christian faith."" [Homily on the Salvation of Man.]

5. ""The right and true Christian faith is (to go on m the words of our own Church), ""not only to believe that Holy Scripture and the Articles of our Faith are true, but also to have a sure trust and confidence to be saved from everlasting damnation by Christ. It is a sure trust and confidence which a man hath in God, that, by the merits of Christ, his sins are forgiven, and he reconciled to the favour of God; whereof doth follow a loving heart, to obey his commandments.""

6. Now, whosoever has this faith, which ""purifies the heart"" (by the power of God, who dwelleth therein) from ""pride, anger, desire, from all unrighteousness"" from ""all filthiness of flesh and spirit;"" which fills it with love stronger than death, both to God and to all mankind; love that doeth the works of God, glorying to spend and to be spent for all men, and that endureth with joy, not only the reproach of Christ, the being mocked, despised, and hated of all men, but whatsoever the wisdom of God permits the malice of men or devils to inflict, --whosoever has this faith thus working by love is not almost only, but altogether, a Christian.

7. But who are the living witnesses of these things I beseech you, brethren, as in the presence of that God before whom ""hell and destruction are without a covering--how much more the hearts of the children of men"" --that each of you would ask his own heart, ""Am I of that number Do I so far practise justice, mercy, and truth, as even the rules of heathen honesty require If so, have I the very outside of a Christian the form of godliness Do I abstain from evil, --from whatsoever is forbidden in the written Word of God Do I, whatever good my hand findeth to do, do it with my might Do I seriously use all the ordinances of God at all opportunities And is all this done with a sincere design and desire to please God in all things""

8. Are not many of you conscious, that you never came thus far; that you have not been even almost a Christian; that you have not come up to the standard of heathen honesty; at least, not to the form of Christian godliness --much less hath God seen sincerity in you, a real design of pleasing him in all things. You never so much as intended to devote all your words and works. your business, studies, diversions, to his glory. You never even designed or desired, that whatsoever you did should be done ""in the name of the Lord Jesus, and as such should be ""a spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to God through Christ.

9. But, supposing you had, do good designs and good desires make a Christian By no means, unless they are brought to good effect. ""Hell is paved,"" saith one, ""with good intentions."" The great question of all, then, still remains. Is the love of God shed abroad in your heart Can you cry out, ""My God, and my All"" Do you desire nothing but him Are you happy in God Is he your glory, your delight, your crown of rejoicing And is this commandment written in your heart, ""That he who loveth God love his brother also"" Do you then love your neighbour as yourself Do you love every man, even your enemies, even the enemies of God, as your own soul as Christ loved you Yea, dost thou believe that Christ loved thee, and gave himself for thee Hast thou faith in his blood Believest thou the Lamb of God hath taken away thy sins, and cast them as a stone into the depth of the sea that he hath blotted out the handwriting that was against thee, taking it out of the way, nailing it to his cross Hast thou indeed redemption through his blood, even the remission of thy sins And doth his Spirit bear witness with thy spirit, that thou art a child of God

10. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who now standeth in the midst of us, knoweth, that if any man die without this faith and this love, good it were for him that he had never been born. Awake, then, thou that sleepest, and call upon thy God: call in the day when he may be found. Let him not rest, till he make his ""goodness to pass before thee;"" till he proclaim unto thee the name of the Lord, ""The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin."" Let no man persuade thee, by vain words, to rest short of this prize of thy high calling. But cry unto him day and night, who, ""while we were without strength, died for the ungodly,"" until thou knowest in whom thou hast believed, and canst say, ""My Lord, and my God!"" Remember, ""always to pray, and not to faint,"" till thou also canst lift up thy hand unto heaven, and declare to him that liveth for ever and ever, ""Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee.""

11. May we all thus experience what it is to be, not almost only; but altogether Christians; being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus; knowing we have peace with God through Jesus Christ; rejoicing in hope of the glory of God; and having the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost given unto us!",John Wesley,1966,"[66, 58, 60, 60, 80, 95]",6

Six bad bitches, some marijuana, where [?] find us
If you could see the pictures and the scriptures that these bitches sent me
Hopped in the Ghost, my wiz jumped in the sister Bentley
When Suge had the Row, Jay start the Roc
I was in the car, ends and all, fuck the cops
With the killer cross, had Iverson on the block
Graced the cover of The Source, tell me that ain't hot
Went in for RICO, kilos, wish they gave me the max
Fuck them C.O.'s, and C-hoes for hatin' on crack
Four months on the toilet, shit, I can do that
Came with thirty, left with three, now how the fuck he do that?
Most these niggas in the Fed shoulda been in the State
Austin, Texas to Brazil, now we raisin' the stakes
I seen Gordouli, know that nigga big like Chapo
Shout out to you know who, let me fuck in the chapel

Tried to send me to the shoe for the fresh pair of Jordans
I had a thing for the secretary, wassup Ms. Jordan?
All that ass in them pants had you feelin' important

Why must you always try to make me over ?
Take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 2]
You're trying to reshape me in a moment
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 3]
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me
Take me as I am or let me go
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me
Take me as I am or let me go

206,Black Is Black,"[Produced by Jungle Brothers]

[Intro: Q-Tip]
Now I'm from a Tribe Called Quest
And I'm here tonight with the Jungle Brothers
And we about to get into this thing called
Black is black is black is black

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Black is black is black is black

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
In America today
I have to regret to say
Somethin, somethin is not right
And it deals with black and white
Tell me Mike G, is it me?
Nah, it's just society
Filled with propaganda, huh?
Why do we meander, huh?
In a zone with hate for peace
All of this BS must cease
All I am is one black man
In a mighty big white hand
Brother brother, sister sister
If you're miss or if you're mister
Listen please to this fact
Black is black is black is black

[Hook: Q-Tip & (Gil Scott-Heron)]
(Don't you think it's a crime)
Black is black is black is black
(Don't you think it's a crime)
Black is black is black is black

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Now way back when in '68
Brothers didn't have it great
They fought back with civil rights
They scarred your soul and took your sight
The common foe you plainly see
On the streets or on TV
Segregation was the king
Vietnam was full in swing
Martin Luther had to shout
Let's get out, get out, get out
The situation's sort of changed
But what really makes matters strange
Is our foe is well disguised
We don't know where our fate lies
Still and all we cannot lack
The fact that black is black is black

[Hook]
(Don't you think it's a crime)
Black is black is black is black
(Don't you think it's a crime)
Black is black is black is black

[Verse 3: Afrika Baby Bam]
Judged by both my race and color
Don't you know we need each other
I need you and you need me
And if not now you soon will see
My light complexion has no meaning
If you think so you're still dreaming
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
There's no time for us to break up
Black is black, not blue or purple
Being black is like a circle
Round and round we all will go
Where we end up I don't know
Listen to me if you will
Your fantasies will get you killed
Reality is what is real
Reality is black is black

[Verse 4: Mike G]
I try, try to tell my people
We all are one, created equal
Before we master we must plan
Is that so hard to understand?
Today's the day we get together
To try to change and make things better
If not where will be be tomorrow?
Drowning in a pool of sorrow
Daylight shines but still few see
That we must fight for unity
In a picture that's fixed as black and white
Why's it both that have to fight?
Uplift the race, uplift the race
See my soul and not my face
All for one and one for all
Black is black - that's right, y'all

208,All Strung Out,"[Verse One]
She gets high
He gets low
But it is his life's strength

He starts to sneeze
And pronounces ""bless me""
Wipes his nose on his shirt
That says ""Kill Whitey""

Takes away the hurt
Real fine
Kind of like listening to
Jimi or Patsy Kline

I'm all strung out on you
You're all left I want to do
I do what you want me to
I'm all strung out on you

[Verse Two]
He digs the seeds in Johnny Cash
But he loves Courtney Love
With a passion

He's got a mom he calls Denise
His daddy cuts his hair
But has always wanted to be
A priest

Heaven knows
Where he comes from
And he knows he waits
Just like a machine gun

[Chorus]
I'm all strung out on you (strung out on you)
You're all that I want to do
Do what you want me to
I'm all strung out on you

[Coda]
You're everything I ever wanted
You're everything I'll ever need

210,Changes,"[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Interlude: 2Pac]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

But I hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
Just take good care of her, take good care of her

I must accept it, she loves you more than me

So walk to me and take me by the hand
And lead me to, and lead me to
The bright untarnished sea
There give me love and share my dreams

215,Poverty,"Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale. They don't realize that America can't exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there's no way in hell we'd allow this country to push it's genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed

Niggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that. The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it's not you who changes the system; it's the system that will eventually change you. There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely, and I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I've been alive to know that it's a serious problem. Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism. You see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials. But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources

I'm quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words. My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others

You see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America. Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States; places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well

As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we'll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined. And that's why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques

But you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people. ""Fuck them, let them fend for themselves."" No, Fuck you, they are you. No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them. They're always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I'd rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I'm really not, just to fit in. And whether we want to accept it or not, that's what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us

I want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We're given the idea that if we didn't have these people to exploit then America wouldn't be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living. No, that's wrong. It's the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money. We have whatever they kick down to us. My enemy is not the average white man, it's not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don't see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies. The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real Mother-Fuckers that I need to bring it to, not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that's too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up

In fact, I have more in common with most working and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people. As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue. Many of us are in the same boat and it's sinking, while these bougie Mother-Fuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we're all in, we're gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole

In other words, I don't want to escape the plantation I want to come back, free all my people, hang the Mother-Fucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground. I want to take over the encomienda
And give it back to the people who work the land

You cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a Fucking lethargic devil. I don't look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole. Most of those successful individuals are sell-outs and house Negros

But, I don't consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto. Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It's not in our culture to be poor. That's only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture and forms of government. You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois league. The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That's why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of white Spaniards once he was captured. Not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans

So in conclusion, I'm not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino. They have to truly represent the community
And represent what's good for all of us proletariat

216,I Can Hear Music,"This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is

Maybe that's why when we're all alone

I can hear music I can hear music
The sounds of the city baby
Just feel so good
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby

Loving you keeps me satisfied

217,Born A Woman,"I, being born a woman and distressed
By all the needs and notions of my kind,
Am urged by your propinquity to find
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest
To bear your body's weight upon my breast:
So subtly is the fume of life designed,
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,
And leave me once again undone, possessed.
Think not for this, however, the poor treason
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,
I shall remember you with love, or season
My scorn with pity, -- let me make it plain:
I find this frenzy insufficient reason
For conversation when we meet again.",Edna St. Vincent Millay,1966,"[31, 24, 13, 13, 16, 12, 13, 19, 20, 22, 28, 38, 63, 93]",14

Life's in a hurry, but
You've got no worry, you're
So mystifyingly glad
I'm Mr. Dieingly Sad

And when the leaves begin to fall
Answering old winter's call
I feel my tears, they fall like rain
Weeping forth the sad refrain
Blue, dark, and dim it may seem
You mark a grin, a moonbeam
Brightens your smile, pray tell me
How all the while you can be
So mystifyingly glad
I'm Mr. Dieingly Sad

You say ""take my hand and walk with me
Wake this land and stop the sea
Show me love, unlock
All doors
I'm yours""

Please share my umbrella

Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it
By August she was mine

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a queue

Came the sun
The ice was melting

Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to a vow

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man

Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside

Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you""
""Take me away from here and be my man""
Then I've looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band

And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded

Stay with me, baby, when you can
It's a pain to see, but I'm still your man

224,The Fife Piper,"...morally neutral, and unimaginably violent.​

On the day Chicago locked his doors for good
Our headless chickens pushed and pecked along their southbound route
They cluck the atrocity, their beaks are posturing
At an old vampire: a forest fire
Any day, the windy city's gonna blow it out for you

I'll keep a horseshoe on my step, I'll keep a cross around my neck
Draping garlic over our beds
All good luck, amulets, and aids will dab your forehead
Keep you safe from the forest fire rage
Our fine crystal will ching, we'll drink to anything
If it keeps the tires moving, keeps commuting smooth for you
And I'm drawing a bloodbath with or without you

And on the day the fire nibbled your neighborhood
Regard your brimstone as if it were gravestone and the blaze we blow loose
Our cottage knees shaking, the flames were giggling
And the embers beaming; its chest, it's beating
That little house we've made gets gobbled up by flames

And I'll mash my foot down on the gas of any black cat that cross my path
Than to risk it or to lay them in my lap
We keep our umbrellas down here, we toss the salt behind our ears
'Cause the good looks weren't worth our seven years
With tightly coiled springs that snap for anything
We're gonna keep a lighter to it even while it burns for you
And I'm going to heaven with or without you

I'll keep a horseshoe on my step, I'll keep a cross around my neck
Draping garlic over our beds
All ladder legs we walk around, no burning flags will touch the ground
With the same one that our cracks we've found, and I swear to God
I'll bury a bible in these halls and I'll bury a black cat between the walls
Good luck, Godspeed, God damn you all

God damn you all
God damn you all
God damn you all
God damn you all",The Paper Chase,1966,"[61, 56, 53, 53, 65, 78, 88, 92]",8

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling in the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""

If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

226,Tomorrow Never Comes,"[Intro]
If tomorrow never comes and I don’t see you again
And I just want you to know that my loving has no end
If tomorrow never comes and I don’t see you again
And I just want you to know that my loving has no end

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah, they say that nothing’s ever promised
Gotta keep the ones around me that are honest
‘Cause there ain’t a guarantee that you gon’ get it ‘cause you want it, right?
And my abeula’s getting old, I need to see her
Before she up and leave us ‘cause she off to meet the reaper
And I don’t wanna lose her ‘fore I really get to know her
I told her that I loved her, I just wanna really show her
My circle getting smaller, every day I’m growing older
I see my fucking breath, I guess my heart is getting colder
They doubt you and then they see your name and crowd around you
The ones that call you fam the ones that care the least about you
If tomorrow never come, I wanna kiss my mom
Maybe find my father and forgive him for the shit he done
Then I find the girls I did the same shit to
And hoping that they would forgive me like how I forgive you, right?
But nothing is for certain, it’s time to take a bow
Yeah, we reached our final curtain

[Hook]
If tomorrow never comes and I don’t see you again
And I just want you to know that my loving has no end
(Tomorrow never comes, tomorrow never comes)
If tomorrow never comes and I don’t see you again
(You sit and you stare at the barrel of a gun)
(Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh yeah yeah)
And I just want you to know that my loving has no end

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
If tomorrow never comes, I’ll burn the capital
In hoping that the fucking White House will turn to shrapnel
‘Cause politicians use tragedies just to catapult
And launch they own careers, hoping that it make us cast a vote
I find the cast that gave my cousin a taste
They gave my aunt a first taste and then I lay them to waste, right?
I hate to see my family in struggle with addiction
But I’m cool with dope boys, it’s such a fucking contradiction
And if tomorrow never comes, I’ll find religion
Maybe then I’ll find my little half-brother and little sister
I heard my little brother had cancer and didn’t hit him
I was young and the last thing I needed was more commitment
But now he’s in remission so tomorrow got to come for him
We ain’t even spoken and I’m back to feeling numb again
Back to telling every chick I fucked that she the one again
Knowing that I’ll soon be making up for it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Emilio Rojas]
If tomorrow never comes, I’ll crash a couple cars
Maybe smash a couple broads, shit I’ll probably fuck ‘em raw
‘Cause ain’t no consequences when your world is over with
I snort a couple lines ‘cause I’m sick of living this sober shit
Try to tell my nieces that I loved them and I wished I woulda seen 'em
Instead of beefing with they mother and I tell my older sister
That I’m sorry that I judged her and I should’ve been supportive
Coulda been a better brother and I run into my city, yeah, I run into the Roc
Take my peoples off them corners, take my people off that block
And I go into my school and tell my teachers that I’ve popped
Even though they never thought that I would be shit but a flop
The way that I’m living, I never would know when I’ll be leaving
And when I’mma go, nothing is coming and we never grow
Running to nothing left us broke, yeah so if tomorrow never comes
I want my people knowing that they were the ones I loved",Emilio Rojas,1966,"[80, 80, 89, 92, 93]",5

While takes just like a woman

And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks up like a little girl

Queen mary, she's my friend
I believe I'll go and see her again
Nobody has to guess
That baby can't be blessed
Till she finds out she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and the pearls

She takes just like a woman
And she makes love just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks up like a little girl

Oh I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
Oh and your long-time curse
It hurts, but what is worse
Is this pain in here, oh I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear, oh I must admit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
And when we meet again and introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

Well you take just like a woman
You make love to me like a woman

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end

To leave a client in jail

Just to think
I could have been president

236,Blue Side Of Lonesome,"(Leon Payne)
I'm calling to tell you it's over
Yes Darling, you're now free to go
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me
But you can't hurt me no more, I know
You're asking me where this call comes from
Oh, I hope that it won't interfere
If your new romance turns out a failure
Well, here's where to find me my dear
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the heartbreak hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Tear Drops
On a bar stool not doin' so well
The floor has a carpet of sorrow
But no one can weep in the aisle
And they say someone broke the bar mirror
With only the ghost of a smile
The hands on the clock never alter
For things never change in the place
There's no present, no past, no future
We're the ones who have lost in lifes race
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the heartbreak hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Tear Drops
On a bar stool not doin' so well...",George Jones,1966,"[63, 59, 59, 60, 64, 64, 67, 88]",8

239,Melody For An Unknown Girl,"Most cultural movements that go on to have staying power begin in the grass roots. They may appear to come about by accident and more or less spontaneously. But more often than not there is an underlying need that summons the energy required to build a movement. As anyone who was around in hip-hop’s formative years can tell you, it was born from the need to know how to rock a party. Plain and simple. That’s how tanning really was propelled. And before the terms “hip-hop” or “rap” officially existed, that’s what a handful of resourceful individuals understood and did to get the whole ball rolling. We’re talking generally about the year 1970—the same year, by the way, that I was born. But it wasn’t until I was nine years old, late in 1979, that I even heard the words “hip” and “hop” strung together or was able to grasp the notion of what being a rapper actually meant. That was when, fatefully, I heard a record that changed my life (and pop culture) forever. Like it’s yesterday, I can still remember that moment over at my aunt’s home in Brooklyn—where it seemed there was always a party under way with relatives and neighbors hanging out, a great spread of food, and new, hot music on the record player. Most stereo systems in those days could be adapted for the single two-sided records that were smaller and had the big hole in the middle (45 RPM) as well as the bigger records with the small holes (33⅓ RPM)—which were the full albums that had several songs on each side. But as the intro plays to what I recognize as “Good Times” by the group Chic and I’m drawn into the living room because it’s a familiar hit song from the previous summer, I encounter a record on the turntable that defies categorization. Instead of the sweet female lead vocals of that disco smash, I hear something totally different and spot a baby-blue label on the black vinyl record I’ve never seen before. Even though it’s a twelve-inch disc, the size of an album, as I listen to the rhyming words being spoken—“Singin’ on ’n’ ’n’ on ’n’ on / The beat don’t stop until the break of dawn / Singin’ on ’n’ ’n’ on ’n’ on on ’n’ on / Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie pop da pop pop / Ya don’t dare stop”—it hits me that this entire side is one long song. Almost fifteen minutes long as it turns out. Or, to be exact, fourteen minutes and thirty-six seconds of pure fun laid over the thumping bass beat from the break of “Good Times” with sing-along words easy to remember and repeat. The record, I discover, is by an unknown group, the Sugarhill Gang, and is called “Rapper’s Delight.” From then on, nobody ever has to tell me what rap is. It’s whatever words are spoken, chanted, or talk-sung, or whatever philosophies, stories, or ideas are espoused, by the house party Master of Ceremonies (the emcee, also known as the MC). Halfway through this first hearing I’m hooked and start playing the song over and over again until I have it memorized, beginning with the invitation to the party that needs no translation: “I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop / A you don’t stop / The rock it to the bang bang boogie /Say up jumped the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.”
Hip hop? There it was. For most of us this was the first general public outing of the hybrid word. People disagree about who exactly coined the term but most sources cite Lovebug Starski as the DJ/MC who, in the early seventies, started referring to the house party scene as cultivating a hip-hop culture. Kids would bring their boom boxes or a DJ would show up with his gear and the party could rock. “Rapper’s Delight” used music that was already in the vernacular (the familiar “Good Times” by Chic) and added new ingredients in the form of spoken-word lyrics made out of fresh expressions. Code. Even if you didn’t know what a “sucka MC” or a “fly girl” was, or how a rhyme could be “vicious,” “Rapper’s Delight” put the language into context and passed the expressions along. What I loved at nine years old was how the lyrics were really funny nursery rhymes, easy to memorize and repeat. Phrases like “Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn” just stuck in your brain, as did the humor of rhyming “hands in the air” with “shake your derriere” or getting sick “from food you ate” and running to the store “for a bottle of Kaopectate.” There was no real social protest. Rap wasn’t there yet. But there was already an authenticity in a brand being shouted out. And the situations were ones that even I at age nine had experienced: “ Have you ever went over to a friend’s house to eat and the food just ain’t no good? / I mean the macaroni’s soggy the peas are mushed and the chicken tastes like wood . . .” On top of all that, it was exciting to think that you could be part of a crew, have a record, just from making up poetry and chanting about stuff that happened all the time. That was fly, seriously fly. Obviously, I wasn’t the only one who thought so. Within a few weeks, it seemed like every kid in Queens had memorized the words to “Rapper’s Delight”—no easy feat for a song that had no bridge or hook—and we would hold battles to see who could recite it from the top without messing up. We were extending our own breaks on the playground or after school, using a popular record to bring fun and meaning into our lives. However, as I noticed at my aunt’s house in Brooklyn, not everybody dug the free-form storytelling and irreverent rhyming. Made no sense. After all, if you listened to the words, you’d hear that the invite was to come one and come all: “I like to say hello / To the black, to the white, the red, and the brown, the purple and yellow.” If Sugarhill was shouting out all colors, it would follow that all generations were welcome too. Maybe, I concluded, there was some frequency level coming from this record that could only be appreciated by the young and the hip and would otherwise fall on deaf older ears, the way a dog whistle can only be heard by canine ears. No doubt this must have been the same reaction older generations had when soul singers like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke started taking music out of the church, or earlier when Charlie Parker and Miles Davis broke from the standards of big-band jazz to bend notes and clash chords. In the days and weeks and months that followed, with “Rapper’s Delight” exploding onto the scene, blasting out of boom boxes, car radios, and record stores, pumping out of windows onto the streets, the generational gap showed itself in the marketplace. Before long, the dog-whistle effect had permeated barriers of color and geography and transformed one of the first-ever rap records from a word-of-mouth success to certified gold. After hitting number four on the R&B list and as high as number thirty-six on the pop list, “Rapper’s Delight” became an anthem for a changing era. It was buoyed by the outdoor fitness craze starting up, including skate and surf culture, along with a growing market for cassette tapes instead of records, and the advent of the Sony Walkman and other personal listening devices. Soon folks of all backgrounds in the cities and suburbs of America were on the move like never before, rocking their own parties and heading into the uncharted waters of the 1980s. The Sugarhill Gang had lit a tanning spark. Ironically—and this is not the only part of the story that is ironic—the three MCs were newcomers who had only performed together as a crew for the first time on the same day as the actual recording session. To explain how that turned out as well as it did, some background is in order.
Rules of AspirationWhenever we revisit history or examine the forces that launched a cultural movement, we naturally speak of the heroes who led the way. So the question of who invented hip-hop is in order. But the question to ask first should not be who so much as what invented this culture. And that answer, easily, bluntly, is the force of aspiration. It’s the power that turns nothing into something, that creates worlds and paves destinies, and changes the have-nots into the have-somes and occasionally the have-it-alls. Without it, I should add, the field of marketing would become obsolete. Aspiration. It’s a mix of desire, hope, imagination, creativity, fearlessness, and a few other ingredients, among which last but not least is belief—specifically, a belief that whatever it is that’s the focus of the aspiration is obtainable. In the late sixties and early seventies, when hip-hop was gestating in pockets of activity scattered around New York’s inner city—with the Bronx at the epicenter—the house party scene had elements that were definitely aspirational. By that I mean if you were network-connected, hooked up to the right people who were at the forefront of seeing who could rock the best parties, that would set you apart, lend you stature, and give you a local calling card. With concerts, clubs, dance halls, and discos propelling existing musical genres into the mainstream, another function of the house parties was to create the newest counterculture. It had aspects of being an underground society, accessible to younger generations in communities of color who couldn’t get into those other venues because of age or disinterest or racial barriers or inability to pay cover charges and afford the nicer clothes those venues required. Youthful rebellion that had fueled movements of the sixties and earlier could have an outlet now as part of the house party counterculture—much like the punk rock scene that was starting up in European cities. Not surprisingly, this was the same steam being vented in the breakout days of ghetto graffiti—known as “writing” and sometimes “tagging”—that revealed another aspect of the aspiration to go against the grain, to gain credibility for having something to say, for saying it with bold lettering, pictures, symbols, and other abbreviated code, and even for breaking the law to say it. Without a doubt, it was vandalism. But it was also, without a doubt, art. In the 1990s, when I started traveling to other cities in the U.S. and abroad, graffiti on unfamiliar walls was a sight for sore eyes. It made me feel at home, regardless of the language, like somebody was there who understood my conversation, my experience and background, and I could understand theirs. Global tanning. And by then, graffiti had become inextricably woven into hip-hop culture, considered one of its four intrinsic elements right alongside DJing, MCing, and B-boying. All of those elements, combined with the energy of youthful aspiration, were in the recipe back in the burgeoning house party era. Add to that the music and attitudes of newly arrived immigrant populations, bringing the strong island flavors of reggae and ska, mixing with the rest of hip-hop’s musical melting pot inheritance. Who wouldn’t want to be around for that? Plus, being part of something you needed a pass to attend gave you credibility, proved that you knew the code, that someone had given you the lowdown. Like most parties in most eras, your coolness quotient would be determined by whether or not you showed up in style, by your ability to hold court (especially with the opposite sex), and absolutely by whether you could hold your own on the dance floor. But to really be the man (or the woman) at any house or yard party, the ultimate aspiration was to control the turntables and/or the mic. The DJ/MC—often one and the same in the early days—was king. In the South Bronx at the time that my generation and I were toddlers, three such kings—known forevermore as the holy trinity of hip-hop—were DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash. Historically, each played a distinct role in pioneering and expanding the musical/cultural field that grew out of the house party scene. Though they battled for supremacy in terms of local appeal—sometimes with literal DJ battles where sheer volume usually ruled the day—each needed the other two to push his own game forward. True to his name, Flash took the basic elements of rap and turned up the wattage on performance and production values. As a DJ, he put himself front and center, over and above his playlist, inventing certain scratch-and-mix techniques almost singlehandedly—like the day when he accidentally dropped the needle on a record and had to hustle to move it in sync to the beat. Flash also increased the number of rappers onstage with him, making the inclusion of a crew of MCs with showmanship skills a rap mainstay. Afrika Bambaataa was a mash-up maestro, playing everything from soul to salsa to disco, from rock, pop, funk, and reggae to TV theme songs. A former gangbanger, he also used his prominence as a DJ to convince some of the warring gangs to take their battles onto the mic or the dance floor. To create order for these functions, Bam went on to devise his own set of rules. As one of the first to codify a means for building the youth movement, Bambaataa would be credited with identifying the required elements that constitute hip-hop. In 1970, the future DJ Kool Herc (fifteen-year-old Clive Campbell, who had recently come to the Bronx from Jamaica) started a house party business, spinning a funky collection of 45s on a rustic borrowed sound system wherever he could get hired. Probably the most daunting issue for him and most aspiring DJs in those days was a technical one—how to extend the break in the music, the most danceable section of the record. Extending the break, logically, was a matter of finding a way to repeat it, to keep the groove steady enough for the break dancers—the break boys and girls, also known as B-boys and B-girls—and hang on to the beat long enough to rap to it, using language, humor, and rhythm to fire up the crowd. Without sampling or the digital devices of future eras, to keep the break repeating on a continuous loop the pioneering DJs came up with the practice of setting up two turntables with the same record and extending the break by switching back and forth, jumping from one turntable to the other, playing the break over from the start, as seamlessly as possible. While Clive refined his technology and style, honing his skills all across the Bronx, he ran track and lifted weights at school, where he earned the superhero nickname of Hercules. Meanwhile, a short-lived stint as a graffiti writer had led him to the sign-off that didn’t totally reveal his identity to the authorities—“Clyde as Kool.” Putting all three identities together, in 1973 he officially became DJ Kool Herc, taking just the Kool from his tagging name and shortening Hercules to Herc. And then, finally, ready to put his learning to the test, in August 1973 Herc decided to join forces with his sister and become an entrepreneur. The two pooled their resources and rented the rec room of the apartment building to which they’d recently moved. The address? It was 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. With nothing more by way of advertising than handwritten invitations promoting the first party and charging a few coins to get in, there must have been the smell of history in the making, because after word got out, kids showed up in droves. The crowd was mixed, mostly AfricanAmerican, some Hispanic who were mainly of Caribbean black descent, and some whose families had recently arrived to the increasingly povertystricken, institutionally abandoned neighborhood, along with a few outliers from other backgrounds. But when the makeshift strobe started to pulse —thanks to a friend flicking the light switch on and off—and DJ Kool Herc took to the mic and began to play the breaks, there was only one language being spoken: pure, unadulterated fun. Hip-hop was born that night, even if it hadn’t been named yet, and so had the legendary status of DJ Kool Herc, whose reputation preceded him far and wide almost overnight. Other masterful MCs and DJs would rise to equal and greater prominence, but because Herc helped to create the language and would therefore remain in a class of his own, nobody could truly take the throne from him. He would forever remain proof of the possibilities, that you could come from nothing, from the streets and even from the least likely circumstances, and make an indelible mark on the world. The quest to leave a mark was not abstract—as could be heard in other voices contributing to the street code. There were the top graffiti writers, who spoke of “bombing” to describe their middle-of-the-night aerosol painting forays into the subway tunnels and onto tracks where the trains were locked down for the night. Battling individually or in crews, the objective was to see whose signature style could be most recognized and whose artwork could travel the farthest—literally, over the greatest stretch of tracks. B-boys and girls, many in their early teens, took existing dance moves out of the clubs, taped down cardboard on concrete, and invented new ways of twisting, flipping, and spinning to create their own signature moves, each one winding up in a gravity-defying “freeze” that if you could nail could make you a legend. The classic B-boy stance, arms folded over your chest, chin jutted, sideways lean, one foot extended, said everything without words—code in the form of gesture that was about defying the odds, about being proud of who you were, what crowd backed you, and inviting or challenging others to engage. So the party kept on rocking throughout the 1970s. Fueled by aspiration, collaboration, and competition, it continued almost completely under the radar of the rest of the world—including most of the island of Manhattan. That is, until some visionary individuals started to bridge the divide for no other reason than that they could. Fab Five Freddy, a Renaissance man of tanning, was one of those people. From Brooklyn, Freddy Brathwaite distinguished himself as a graffiti writer by tagging a particular train on the IRT line so often that he took the number—5—as part of his name. Also known as Freddy Love, a nickname that fits his outgoing energy and embrace of everyone and everything hip-hop, he had the crazy idea early in the game that graffiti artists were as important to popular culture as was, say, Andy Warhol. To make that statement, Fab Five Freddy began bombing trains by painting them with oversized Campbell’s soup cans, Warhol pop art style. It was a shout-out to an icon most graffiti writers didn’t necessarily know, and at the same time it signaled to the downtown art world that subway art could stand alongside high-priced works in their galleries, all day, any day. In fact, that idea would be captured in the 1983 breakout movie Wild Style, in which graffiti artist Lee Quinones starred and Freddy played a supporting role, as well as contributing to the soundtrack. A feature film with a fictional story line but shot like a documentary, Wild Style brought to life the roots of hip-hop culture. Writer/ director Charlie Ahearn cast many of the actual leading figures from the scene to make the movie all the more authentic. Whenever Freddy describes how the gaps between these seemingly disconnected worlds were bridged, he usually goes back to hip-hop’s jazz underpinnings, particularly in bebop—one of his earliest influences. Freddy’s godfather, jazz drummer and bebop pioneer Max Roach, was best friends with his dad, and in that mingling of black and Jewish and other immigrant sensibilities seeds were planted for cultural tanning and for the musical disobedience of conventional rules. Freddy told me, “My dad and Max and all the jazz guys believed that they were pushing music forward out of the underground to become the most important popular American art form. But then rock ’n’ roll and the Beatles happened and jazz, more or less, was pushed to the sidelines.” Miles Davis—and other musical rule-breakers—then rebelled against being segregated to a genre that spoke only to a narrow constituency. So Miles found the intersection between jazz and rock after going to the Fillmore and seeing Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. One day when Max Roach had come to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn for a visit, a party was taking place with a DJ and Fab doing some of his own fun rhyming to the beat. After he had done his thing, Roach pulled him aside and told young Brathwaite, “This is some serious sh*t.” Popular music had always balanced melody, rhythm, and harmony; but now, Max Roach observed, the rhythm was going to take center stage and it was as powerful a force, even in infancy, as he had ever heard. To Fab Five Freddy, the baton really had been passed from bebop to rap pioneers with some help from R&B and rock ’n’ roll—as early as the sixties—so that the next form of counterculture expression (hip-hop) could pick up where jazz had been sidelined in order to give musical/cultural sharing its popular due. Freddy didn’t stop there. Before long, amazingly, he was instrumental in helping bring the uptown house party sensibility downtown. Not only did Fab Five Freddy help connect rap with the artsy disco/punk rock scene, but he also convinced gallery owners to open their doors to the work of graffiti writers. The next thing everyone knew, the most notorious East Coast graffiti artists were being linked with the likes of Fab’s downtown friends Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. Suddenly gallery owners, art collectors, and critics were proclaiming the magnificence of graffiti on canvas as both serious and worth investing thousands of dollars in. The aspirational message that you could leave your mark on the world—and make some real money doing it—was new to the practitioners who had been doing the graff writing and rapping, as Fab observed, “from the standpoint of teenage angst.” And it was going to reverberate much more powerfully once rappers started to become recording artists. But that process, believe it or not, was not going to be so easy.
It Takes a WomanThe atmosphere of a house party, by its nature, never lent itself in any obvious way to recording or media technology. For radio programming and the sales of single records, the cut needed to last about three minutes. With most MCs rapping over the breaks of existing records, besides the fact that they could go on and on ’n’ ’n’ on for as long as an hour (or many more), they weren’t exactly writing songs that could be copyrighted lyrically or melodically. Besides that, the raps were frequently improvisations—freestyles—and included input from the crowd. What had been successful was the homemade mix tapes made and sold through word of mouth, not too differently from other street fare. Also, selling mix tapes at house parties—or at other performance settings where rap was becoming a viable offering—could be a lucrative business for local and celebrity DJs. That was enough to convince a new crop of independent producers to try to solve the puzzle of how to get rap onto records. For a while, nothing really worked and the consensus was that perhaps the elements were only suited for the live experience. But as the decade flew by and disco ran its course while R&B and other black artists were signed to major corporate labels—making Michael Jackson’s Off the Wall one of the biggest recording phenomena of 1979—there was a void in the marketplace. Time for something different, something new. With the belief that rap’s moment had come, enterprising African-American indie-label producers stepped up their game, now with better results from a rap record or two that had existing fans impressed. Still, the magic hadn’t yet transferred to vinyl. While everyone was looking for the right mix, the resourceful producer who believed that such a translation was imminent and who wanted to be the one to do it first was former recording artist Sylvia Robinson of “Love Is Strange” and “Pillow Talk” hit fame. In mid-1979, Sylvia and her husband had recently opened the doors of their new label, Sugar Hill Records, in Englewood, New Jersey, and needed product. And, as the story goes, after hearing MCs rhyming at a few different parties, she began scouring the town to identify the top talent and record them. But much to her surprise, no crew with name value or real credibility was interested. Why should they have been? After all, the motivation for rappers was to master the art form and win the love of the live and local audience. So any commercial recording enterprise might run the risk of being seen as inauthentic to the house party/performance art medium. Besides, if you were among the best MCs and wanted to put out a record, you would either produce it yourself (as with mix tapes) or go with an established label, not a start-up spearheaded by an outsider with ties to conventional R&B in suburban New Jersey. But as I learned from my own mom, later from my daughter, and pretty much from every influential female in my life, there is no stopping a woman on a mission. Sylvia Robinson was relentless and resourceful. Instead of discovering a crew of leading rappers who had MC’d together and had an identity and a following, Sylvia ended up signing three guys on the fringes of the scene—if that—who had never performed together up until the day they went into the studio the first time. One was Wonder Mike, a friend of Sylvia’s son, who theretofore had been employed in a pizza joint, where he practiced his rhymes on customers. Another was Master Gee, signed by Sugar Hill Records after he arranged for an audition. The third, Big Bank Hank, was allegedly discovered when Sylvia heard him rapping in the kitchen of a nightclub where he worked as a bouncer. Now that the crew had been built to order, the real producing challenge was deciding what the track would be and how the instrumentation would be laid down without a DJ. Here history gets kind of murky, but as best as I can put it together, it seems that the resourcefulness of another woman, Debbie Harry—lead singer of the band Blondie and a key figure in tanning for a few reasons—played an unwitting role in the selection process. It was Harry, a sex symbol and seventies sensation, American but aligned with British punk rock and new wave, who helped connect the megahitmaking writer/producer Nile Rodgers of the band Chic to the house party rap scene then moving into clubs and dance halls. Pulling the strings for that connection as well was none other than Fab Five Freddy, who had been talking to Debbie and her boyfriend/musical collaborator Chris Stein about pulling off a huge concert that would feature up-and-coming MCs along with Blondie, Chic, and the Clash. Though the big concert never took place, they were able to get Nile Rodgers out to a rap show. And when he took to the stage and began to play Chic’s latest summer hit, “Good Times,” all of a sudden Fab and some of the top rappers in the audience leapt onto the stage, grabbed mics, and began freestyling away. Whether or not anyone from Sugar Hill Records was in the audience, no one knows. But what is known is that from then on, at shows around town, a mainstay of the entertainment was often somebody getting up to rap to “Good Times.” When that was chosen as the basis for Sugar Hill’s first rap record, it showed how well the label was paying attention. When some of those freestyle lyrics that got passed from party to party ended up on the record, it was hard for anyone who may have come up with the original lines to claim credit because they weren’t copyrighted or published. After “Rapper’s Delight” came out, however, there was no debate about the fact that Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards were owed songwriting credit for the recognizable bass line that had been borrowed, innocently or not, from “Good Times” and they had no problem getting it. To this day, no one can believe that the bass player hired for the session—before recording techniques for sampling were around—was able to keep the same line going perfectly for the entire fourteen minutes and thirty-seven seconds. Everyone assumed that they were playing the actual record and extending the break. Some might say that Sylvia Robinson had gotten lucky, having gone out to find gold where everyone else was looking for it and then coming up with the first catch. But I think it was much more than luck or great timing when she made the strategic decision to record and release “Rapper’s Delight” as an almost-fifteen-minute extended-play twelve-inch single. Even as a novelty record that only sold on the street by word of mouth, it would have been brilliant. Yet the real brilliance was following up the street success by enflaming consumer demand for radio play. How else do you get DJs to disrupt rotation rules to play a fifteen-minute single other than by flooding the station’s request lines? So the gauntlet had been thrown down. The proof was in. If you were aspirational, you now believed in the possibilities. If you had seen what Sugar Hill Records had accomplished, going from nothing to being the hottest indie label for a genre that had yet to be defined—with the serious profits to go with that—your conclusion would be that you might have a shot too. If you had heard a nearly fifteen-minute hip-hop record on the radio at prime time and you were paying attention to its broad-based appeal, you had to know there was a lot more gold in them thar hills. You probably would have been thinking those things if you were a charismatic young man from Queens with incredible instincts and entrepreneurial blood in your veins, say, by the name of Russell Simmons, and were starting to try your hand at managing hip-hop artists and producing rap records—now that the field had broken wide-open. Or at least that’s what I would assume by the fact that just in time for the winter holidays at the end of 1979, one of Russell’s artists, Kurtis Blow, was signed to Mercury Records—the first rapper to go with a major label—and they released his “Christmas Rappin’,” which promptly sold four hundred thousand copies. Following that up with “The Breaks,” Kurtis soon went on to become the first rapper to have a gold record and to perform it on the popular music TV show Soul Train. Of course, the increasingly corporate-run music industry and mainstream media should have now been on notice that hip-hop was more than a passing fancy, more than a disco afterthought tossing crumbs out to the ghetto kids. Even if it was conceivable that there was a hungry market behind the graffiti’d walls or on the other side of the tracks, the industry executives didn’t speak that language—and, frankly, had no interest in learning to. As in any cultural disconnect, one could say that there was a degree of ethnocentricity in their lack of concern about urban blight and the fact that stretches of the inner city right in their backyards were beginning to look like war zones, with working-class families teetering on the edge. One could say that they saw but looked away, unable as they were to understand why it was that at the dawn of the 1980s, most of the symbols of aspiration, with a few exceptions, were turning out to be drug dealers and pimps. The sociology of rap’s future, however, wasn’t really at issue. The music was simply not commercially enticing, nor was it justified to an industry really marketing to white kids in suburbia. The math told the story. With the sizable price tags for producing the music videos that were going to be mandatory for record promotion, given the advent of MTV, the costs of investing in an unproven genre like hip-hop, without superstars, made the discussion a nonstarter. Lest we forget, the MTV platform when it launched in 1981 was rock, mostly new wave and hard rock and later metal—with artists like David Bowie, Duran Duran, and, eventually, Bon Jovi. MTV flat-out refused to show the video of Rick James’s smash “Super Freak,” and it wasn’t until 1983 that Michael Jackson videos were approved for rotation. All of this is to say that if you were betting the odds, as is the case for most businesses most of the time, after “Rapper’s Delight” and Kurtis Blow’s appearance on Soul Train, the assumption might have been that the fun had by hip-hop and its fans was over. But not everybody was betting the odds, thankfully. Enter Blondie and their 1981 single “Rapture,” on the Chrysalis label—with its accompanying music video that took everyone by surprise. With a song that followed a rock model, out of nowhere, after the first verse, here was a white girl, a punk/pop singer, suddenly doing a change-up— rapping over the break. Not just rhyming, Debbie Harry was also talking about the sexy world of rap, even going so far as to name two of its celebrities, Fab Five Freddy and Grandmaster Flash. In fact, they were both supposed to be in the video but Flash couldn’t make it, so Fab Five Freddy showed up with Jean-Michel Basquiat; the two can be seen to this day in the video, graff-writing on the walls. This was not the last time that Freddy would play a role in hip-hop’s migration into the world of music videos, as we’ll see later on. And meanwhile, the door couldn’t have been opened at a better time. True, “Rapture” didn’t make Debbie Harry’s career. But what it did for rap music was everything. When the record charted at number one on the Hot 100 Billboard list, it became the first rap-infused single to do so. Plus, the “Rapture” video made history as the first outing of rap on MTV. Coming from Blondie, it was a signal of how adaptive the genre was and how it would not be restricted to one kind of music over another. A creative liberation! What’s more, by using her prominence at that time to shout out two hip-hop icons, Debbie Harry authenticated an art form.

The translation was that hip-hop proved that it was as akin to rock as it was to soul and funk. For those ready to push boundaries, it could be as full of protest and social relevance, and also as capable of creating a culture, a mind-set, a voice for the voiceless. The first record on which I heard a semblance of those properties was Melle Mel’s “White Lines,” released in 1983 on Sylvia Robinson’s Sugar Hill Records. The production, to me, was memorable, laying Melle’s rock-laced voice over an addictive track. Once again, Sylvia Robinson was paying attention to the competition, and keeping one step ahead. Well, not quite. Apparently, Sylvia Robinson made the mistake of turning down a video of “White Lines” starring a young Laurence Fishburne that was made on spec by an up-and-coming filmmaker. You might have heard of him: Spike Lee.
The Color of ConfidenceHip-hop came of age in the mid-1980s, in the same era that members of the generation who couldn’t remember a time without it were coming of age. We weren’t in the record business and weren’t watching from the sidelines taking notes about how many units of this or that release had shipped or what the demographics were that turned “Christmas Rappin’” into a huge hit or that allowed “Rapture” to be shown on MTV or that pushed “White Lines” up to number seven on the UK pop charts—yes, pop. For us, in our lives and concerns, we would have been like, Where the f**k is the UK?
No exaggeration. Fab Five Freddy once told me a story about the early days when rap artists first started making money and then began touring overseas. Fab happened to run into a DJ he knew who was bragging about all the foreign places their crew had visited—“France, Italy, and London . . .” As if that wasn’t the really big news, the guy quickly added, “And next year, we go to Europe!” Encompassed in these anecdotes is one of the most important rewritten rules of the new economy that can be traced to hip-hop’s formative years. For far too long the classic rags-to-riches stories had been told about dead guys with names like Ford, Rockefeller, and du Pont—all far removed from most people’s reality. Now, suddenly, acts of wonder had come to pass and kids you knew personally or had heard about in your own neighborhood—who had come out of the projects or been born without wealth and stature—had become famous and were making money to go with that too. You could do that? Even if you couldn’t shoot hoops or win the lottery? Suddenly, you could wipe away the stigma of poverty and lower-class status pinned on you by other forces because of color or immigrant background or all the other reasons for not making the grade. Now you could claim your unlikely beginnings as a badge of honor, of authenticity, as a way of saying, “I come from nothing and look where I am now.” Actually, as the culture congregated further with the force of tanning, you had to have a badge to make you credible, to prove that you had come up through hard times that were real—possibly that you had even held your own with killers and gangsters and drug dealers. But wait. Better yet, you could wear a badge of authenticity with trend-setting style, and at the same time be a poet and speak about experiences that the rest of the world seemed to be ignoring. That was Run-DMC. With cuts like “Hard Times” actually talking about real-world problems and “Sucker MC’s,” a record that compared the aspirational success of rappers authentically working on their skills to that of the wannabe “sad-faced clown” imitators and posers, the rhymes and stories echoed the feel of Sunday morning sermons. Those songs were transformational for me, especially “Sucker MC’s.” They came from where I did and were calling themselves rap royalty. Who did that? Who had that kind of nerve? But that was the point—that if hip-hop didn’t shout itself out, nobody else would. The idea was planted then and there that would take root and would later drive me as an entrepreneur to dare to take on the Goliaths of the competition—and would convince me that I could win. And to top all that, Run-DMC had the bold confidence not just to borrow elements from rock but also to cast themselves as the rightful purveyors of it, that they together were the “King of Rock” as the title of a 1985 single and album (their second) put it. The video of that single was their second that MTV agreed to air and its success suggested there was a niche for a hybrid rock-rap genre ready for prime time. Then the game changed with “Walk This Way”—the tipping point for tanning. Everything that had happened going back to DJ Kool Herc and 1520 Sedgwick Avenue had helped put hip-hop over the top, even if it had been an uphill climb over unknown terrain. “Walk This Way” was going to send the next moves into fast downhill skiing. Released as a single on the same album as “My Adidas,” it would also set the stage for history to unfold in August 1986 at Madison Square Garden. When I talk about Run-DMC as being groundbreaking—for all kinds of reasons and especially for knowing that their art form was much bigger than two turntables and a mic—I am including the team that made their impact possible. Russell Simmons was the individual who proved to one and all (and has continued to do so since) that the ceiling for rap and hip-hop that everyone else believed was there really wasn’t. Three others in the Rush/Def Jam circle who should have special mention are Bill Adler, Lyor Cohen, and Rick Rubin. Besides the fact that I know them and have a kinship to them personally and professionally, the three all happen to be white—yet have soul in their veins and urban sensibilities from Jewish and/or immigrant backgrounds. As a publicist, Bill Adler was way ahead of the curve in recognizing the mainstream marketing potential for rap artists. Lyor Cohen—now a top record-industry executive and a former Rush partner who started as a promoter and road manager for Run-DMC— believed early on in the cultural melting pot that was being brewed for and by the younger generation. The genius producer Rick Rubin, who launched Def Jam before joining forces with Russell, was a key contributor to the DNA of hip-hop. What’s more, Rick was the audio architect and sound engineer of tanning—a bridge between rock and rap that worked because he sonically knew what was authentic to the mix and what appealed to young audiences, regardless of background. From the start through his present-day post at the helm of a major record label—after working with everyone from LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys in the early years to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, U2, and the Dixie Chicks (to name a few)—Rick never had any use for the color/demographic boxes used in creating and marketing music. Someone who has always understood the beats and rhythms of culture because he observes it authentically rather than packaging it, Rick Rubin is to me the Norman Rockwell of popular music—an artist portraying Americana at its heart and providing insights into the culture in the process. As reports have it, the irony of “Walk This Way” was that when the team at Rush Management first proposed the idea for Run-DMC to use Aerosmith’s 1977 hit single and merge rock and hip-hop elements on the record, there was hesitation. The main pushback was that just rapping over the tracks would be inauthentic and not original enough. So Rick proposed that Run-DMC do a cover of the single, a reinvention, and then the rockers could come in and add flavor from their rock roots. It was a true mash-up. Anyone betting the odds would say that doing a musical clash is risky, resulting in neither fish nor fowl. Yet when it works, it’s not a musical clash at all but actually a cultural clash. In fact, the word “clash” is wrong. When it works, it’s tanning, a synergy of music and attitude that swirls everyone into the same vortex and connects them. “Walk This Way” did that musically, culturally, rhythmically, and lyrically. And, oh yeah, visually. Even though it was assumed that Aerosmith would benefit somehow from having one of the group’s biggest hits back in circulation in a new form, nobody could have predicted to what extent. Lo and behold, when Steven Tyler and Joe Perry agreed to be on the record and in the video, all of a sudden the new “Walk This Way” reinvigorated their career and launched them to unprecedented heights, giving them a street pass with a whole new following in communities of color. And there was more. After being lured out of the 1970s rock ’n’ roll mausoleum, their collaboration with Run-DMC returned them so much to the game that Aerosmith soon entered their most prolific decades. To date, they are considered the all-time top-selling American rock band, with more gold and platinum records than any other group—over 150 million albums sold around the world. And as for Run-DMC, when they appeared in their own video with rock legends as their guests, they made history in being instantaneously embraced by an audience that had never heard of hip-hop—let alone bought their records. There was nothing earth-shattering in the song’s story—about a loser who gets schooled in how to improve his odds with the opposite sex by changing his attitude and learning to “Walk this way-ay-ay! ” and “Talk this way-ay-ay! ” But in describing a situation that is universal in every neighborhood on the planet, it had a perfect message for bringing different audiences onto common ground. After all, beyond the things like having fame and money and being cool that were sought through aspiration, the super-objective was getting girls. Or appealing to guys if you were a girl. Maybe not for everyone. However, speaking for teenage males, as I was back then, and for young men too, in my experience, it was not just why you wanted to be successful but why you woke up every morning and why you even breathed in the first place. The translation was that everybody, regardless of color or background, wants to get some and to have the sexual confidence to get it. Who couldn’t relate to that? So “Walk This Way” was tanning at work at a primal level. On another deep, equally powerful level, the video spoke to cultural differences and similarities with a story that came down to a rock/rap battle. At the start, it had the two groups in two separate recording studios divided by a wall, each first annoyed at having their music co-opted by the other, and then in the end bashing through the wall to jam and dance together. Speaking now in one collective voice, even with different accents, Aerosmith and Run-DMC doubled down on the message to be who you are and not to be afraid to define yourself by your own style, authentically. It was all about having confidence in yourself and in how you walked and carried yourself, with individuality, pride, purpose, and insistence. The word popularized to describe this commodity and attitude, as we now know, is “swagger.” The first strand of code in the cultural translation could now be identified. It combined within it the elements of aspiration, authenticity, relevance, cool, and confidence that were obtainable by association with the music. Oh yeah, and it came with a sexy, irresistible beat. For any smart marketing person, this concoction was made to order no matter what the product. Right? Well, yes, if you cut to the future. Over the next two decades or so, as rap stars aligned themselves with status goods and services, they would indeed be a gold mine for marketing all manner of high-end consumer brands—as they voluntarily sang the praises of everything from Courvoisier cognac and Cristal champagne to Louis Vuitton and Versace to Range Rovers and Cadillac Escalades. Even the Robb Report, the magazine of conspicuous consumption for only the über-rich, would get a shout-out. And just like “My Adidas” back in 1986, because none of these endorsements were solicited or purchased, the marketing value was all the more meaningful. Expressions of brand loyalty, in short, were manifestly genuine—which, when embraced in culturally fluent ways, would make them incredibly effective. Today, all of that is a foregone conclusion. But it would have read like a fairy tale if you had presented such a scenario to marketing people— even back in the go-go 1980s heyday of conspicuous consumption. Why? Frankly, because of two groups of haters who weren’t interested in rap music or hip-hop culture or the demographics they represented.
Curiosity as Cultural, Economic YeastHaters are reactionary, hate anything new or different, and see danger in venturing off into the unknown. They are certainly not friendly to creative expansion or marketing risk. In the 1980s, a decade of conglomerate takeovers and corporate megamergers, one group of haters who stood in the way of hip-hop’s mainstream success was populated by the marketing power players at leading brands. That’s why it was so unprecedented when Adidas marketing executive Angelo Anastasio came to Madison Square Garden and was wowed enough by what he saw to strike the endorsement deal for the trio of rappers. As it was pointed out to me by Lyor Cohen (there that night as RunDMC’s road manager), the mainstream market appeal wasn’t the main selling point for Anastasio. The crowd that night was still mostly AfricanAmerican, with a smaller percentage of Hispanic and Asian concertgoers and a sprinkling of white urban kids. But what made Anastasio different from other corporate representatives, according to Lyor, was his curiosity. He was simply open-minded enough to contemplate the possibilities of introducing hip-hop to the marketing machinery behind Adidas sneakers. When Lyor described that night and how everything fell into place, it occurred to me how important curiosity is in general for tanning to occur. And as a marketing 101 lesson, one that I had to learn and one I have to remind corporate clients not to forget, advertising dollars don’t mean a thing without genuine curiosity about what consumers want and need. In fact, as Lyor recalled, while the Adidas/Run-DMC alliance did well for all concerned—saving the company from extinction—it could have been much more successful. Unfortunately, instead of gaining consumer insights and bringing Run, DMC, or Jam Master Jay in on designing the footwear and in on how to promote their line of sneakers, the company took over for Angelo and ran a campaign with the old-school “father knows best” approach. They let the designers try to figure out the culture and design into it without a true understanding of the consumer. They marketed via the monologue that dictates cool rather than inviting consumers to partake in the cool. That said, the Adidas missteps were going to be lessons learned for certain entrepreneurs who were paying attention and whose business wheels were starting to turn. For them, it was fortunate that there were mainstream corporate haters who even by the late 1980s weren’t curious enough to even consider hip-hop’s musical future. Why do I say that it was fortunate for these entrepreneurs? Because it allowed them and local economies to benefit and prime the pump for everyone else to follow suit. Surprisingly, the second group of haters who slowed rap music’s mainstream success—and who weren’t curious about its potential—actually came from within the African-American community. Typically older, wealthier, assimilated generations who had come out of the era of protest and civil rights, they reacted with discomfort to the bravado of youthful aspiration and the booming bass of rap blasting out of car stereos and trekking down the streets. Their position, it seemed, was that they had worked too hard for too long, following paths into higher education and into positions of influence in politics, business, and media, to support the hip-hop phenomenon that might outshine them or disrupt their means of having stature. Black media, usually the first to back African-American entertainment, was especially resistant to embracing hip-hop. Until rap music proved itself worthy of mainstream consideration, most of the top black radio stations and video programmers just weren’t interested. In fact, there were radio stations that specifically said on air, “We don’t play rap music,” in order to get more listeners. However, because of the mostly generational divide, it forced hip-hop to become bigger than just a genre of popular music with merchandise; it forced it to prove itself in mighty ways and to develop capacities for spreading into the worlds of fashion, beauty, art, dance, sports, gaming, language, lifestyle, and eventually politics.

And that’s how the culture left behind its house party roots and really took on a life of its own to become bigger than the sum of its parts. It was like any other teenager, determined to grow up and become whoever it chose to be. If you are a marketer hoping to attract new customers without losing your core consumers, this early phase of hip-hop still has relevance for how you appeal to aspiration and how you use code to do so. As we will see later on, consumers provide all the needed cues for how to do that—as long as attention is paid to them.",Steve Stoute,1966,"[77, 74, 74, 84]",4

Then I tell 'em adios
If you got a bad bitch and she suck a good dick
Better lock her pussy down and you call it Guantanamo
Huh, that pussy tryna run, call that cardio
This gon' be a lot of fun, moon turn to the sun
We gon' get it to tomorrow
Spend a couple car notes on a couple bottles
Yo the rich shit don't end
You don't wanna roll all along, tell your homies come on
And it's on, I'ma hit your friend
Uh, I'm cool with it if you cool with it
If you suck, spit and you drool with it

253,"Stop, Look And Listen","(Warning)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Turn up your radio, stand by the speakers
Brace yourself, or you might get weaker
My rhymes hypnotize your total insides
Now we're about to take a serious ride
Meet me, here's the introduction
My name's Freddie Foxxx, and I'm the rap seductor
You wanna run up, run up right to come get this
So you can all witness lyrical fitness
The rapper that you're hearin is the microphone killer
The b-boy idol and the fly girl thriller
The microphone mangler, MC strangler
Milky as silk pads, rougher than Wrangler
Mad for the mic, waitin in a rage
I'm tight and all anxious to rush the stage
Rappers sit back, relax and get cosy
I'm about to play y'all like ring around the rosie
Pack up your rhymes and move south
Or else it's '1st round, Freddie by a knock-out'
You can't move, I got you surrounded
Huh, cause I wrote rhymes and bass pounded
To the body ( *cutting* ) to the head ( *cutting* )
How you gonna last on stage with Fred?
Your mind's workin overtime thinkin bout the latest
Hit from the baritone voice of the greatest
Open your eyes, so you can all see it
If you wanna go out like a whimp, then so be it
I keep comin, it never stops
Kill your brain, give you no props
Blast the music, see what you're missin
Stop (stop) look (look) and listen

(Warning)
Watch the Foxxx

[ VERSE 2 ]
Time is precious, so I'mma keep goin
Bustin off rhymes, watch me keep flowin
When I storm, you're in my way, you're smashed
Drug to the Dungeon, and then crashed
Line em up one at a time, and I take em
Bring em up, 5s and 10s, and I break em
Nobody walks, all comers get hurt
Killin up MC's, that's my work
See, rappers wanna strong-arm, but they ain't strong enough
To bite a rhyme, cause their wind ain't long enough
Take the breath of death when you chew my rhymes
If you wish to die so early, fine
Music in the background sets the sound
For me to grab the mic and break it down
One line compliments the next, and you're fiendin on it
It's like you can't even walk, so you lean on it
Then I guide ya, saddle and ride ya
The voice of the Foxxx ringin all inside ya
Place your bets, his rhymes will wet
And even if I dried him off, he still sweats
Soak him in scratches, beats and rhymes
Nobody else's - mines
Walk on stage and try to be the man
And watch Foxxx kick the mic our your hand
Call you 'son', make you sit in your corner
And slap you up like little Jack Horner
If the message ain't clear by now, you won't know it
Be careful, steppin to Foxxx and you'll blow it
Blast the music, see what you're missin
Stop (stop) look (look) and listen

[ VERSE 3 ]
Yo, Kut Terrorist, back up the music
Break out some hip-hop, watch me protrude this
The music is well composed
If you cover your ears, the beat'll bust your nose
My style is dark, indeed, goes a thousand leaps
Into the minds of those that sleep
For those wide awake, sit and observe
The musical master of a million words
Or would you rather see a basic MC?
If so, leave, cause that ain't me
The brag-andboastin, so-called hostin
Need a little lesson in burn-and-roastin
Catch the beat, and clap your hands
And see if we can get all the skins to dance
Open your eyes and ears, stop and look, this ain't dissin
You just have to listen",Freddie Foxxx,1966,"[85, 97]",2

Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!
If I don't start crying it's because that I have got no eyes

Be your #1 fool, make that sacrifice

Ooo hoo, only my finger knows how many tears I've cried, baby
Only my heart knows the awful hurt I feel inside, baby

Be your #1 fool, at any sacrifice

264,Ain't Nobody Home,"Once upon a time, a long long time ago, wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow
Girl, you put me through some pain and misery
And now you are standing on my doorstep, telling me how much you need me
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

How many times I begged for you to come home, but you laughed at me and said let me alone
Through my falling tears I saw you walk away
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you, but this time, baby, it's your turn to beg
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

Girl, I used to love you, placed no one else above you
Gave you everything that I own
Girl, you can't come back here
Ain't nobody home

Once upon a time, when you went on your way
But, girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day
But time has made some changes, turned me upside down
So, you can beg me to forgive you, but this time, baby, you can turn right around

It hurts me to see him treat you the way that he does

If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see those tears in your eyes

The whole town is talking, they're calling you a fool
For listening to his same old lies
And when I know I could be so true
If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see the way he makes you cry

[Verse 3]
You love him so much, you're too blind to see
He's only playing a game
He's never loved you
He never will
And, darling, don't you know he'll never change

Oh, I know that he never will set you free
Because he's just that kind of guy

Till a sudden thought came to my head, that I should roam away
For I'm sick and tired of slavery since the day that I was born
And I'm off to join the IRA and I'm off tomorrow morn

And we're all off to Dublin in the green, in the green
Where the helmets glisten in the sun
Where the bayonets flash and the rifles crash
To the rattle of a Thompson gun

I'll leave aside me pick and spade, I'll leave aside me plough
I'll leave aside me horse and yoke, I no longer need them now
I'll leave aside me Mary, she's the girl that I adore
And I wonder if she'll think of me when she'll hear the rifles roar

And we're all off to Dublin in the green, in the green
Where the helmets glisten in the sun
Where the bayonets flash and the rifles crash
To the rattle of a Thompson gun

And when the war is over and dear old Ireland is free
I'll take her to the church to wed and a rebel's wife she'll be
Well, some men fight for silver and some men fight for gold
But the IRA are fighting for the land that the Freestaters stole

272,The Joker Went Wild,"Once I was a king, I thought always a king
'Cause I just captured someone's heart
But may I explain, I treated her mean
And then my kingdom fell apart

I found I couldn't sleep at night
And when I found her gone from sight
Found out I loved her
Became a joker

The joker went wild and he couldn't smile
Because he had lost everything
The joker went wild and he couldn't smile
He felt no longer like a king

Some friendly advice, treat her heart nice
Or she won't stay for very long if at all
If you think you're a king and you know everything
Just remember, the joker or you'll fall from her arms

You'll find you cannot sleep at night
And when you find her gone from sight
You'll find you loved her
Become a joker

282,That's Enough,"[Куплет 1]
Новое утро меня не обрадует как вчера
Где моё счастье? Кажется я потерял себя
Пальцы так пахнут, сигареты меня манят ещё курить
Ещё одно утро, когда хочется встать и про всё забыть

[Припев]
Хватит стараться, хватит пытаться
Уже ничего не произойдёт
Мне бы не сдаться, мне бы остаться
Но больше не биться головой об лёд
Хватит стараться, хватит пытаться
Нет больше сил, и уже всё равно
Всё что осталось в ночи потерялось
У меня есть лишь дым и дешёвое вино

[Куплет 2]
Мне не интересно практически всё, что так любите вы
И скучные сериалы мне так не хватает прошлой весны
Я не изменился, во мне та же злоба и ненависть, но
Я не виноват, ведь всё что я люблю для вас не стоит ничего

[Припев]
Хватит стараться, хватит пытаться
Уже ничего не произойдёт
Мне бы не сдаться, мне бы остаться
Но больше не биться головой об лёд
Хватит стараться, хватит пытаться
Нет больше сил, и уже всё равно
Всё что осталось в ночи потерялось
У меня есть лишь дым и дешёвое вино

Giggle tickle fiddle little wiggle around

Back and forth go stand on your head
Colors of the rainbow, yellow and red
Windshield wipers slapping in the rain
Go flapping and a clappin' and a chuggin like a train

Giggle tickle fiddle little wiggle around
Left right backwards and upside down
Giggle tickle fiddle little wiggle around
Go walkin' and a talkin' and a squalkin' to the sound

Sunshine bright stars above
Gleaming in the moonlight with the one you love
Hands on your head, go hopping around

Break his heart, telling him goodbye

She's got the power to sink him
In the winking of an eye

Only half of the man, I used to be

And when she's gone, he'll just wanna die

286,I Struck It Rich,"I love you, baby
Need you, darling, all right

Now that I found gold
You know I'm gonna stake my claim
It's not the kind of gold
That gives a man fortune and fame

Before I met you, girl
My life was so empty
To others, I'm still poor
But to me, I've got plenty
And, baby, let me tell you, baby

[Chorus:]
I struck it rich when I found you, baby
And I found you in the nick of time
I struck it rich when I found you, honey
And I'll be rich just as long as you're mine

Cause I love you, baby
I need you, darling, all right

Girls like you are rare, it's true
You can't find them no more
But I was like a miner searching
Hard to find it and got my reward

Many years ago, a wise man said
Good things come to those
Who go out and get it
And, baby, I went out and got you

I struck it rich when I found you, baby
Oh, I found you in the nick of time
I struck it rich when I found your loving
And I'll be rich just as long as you're mine

Cause I love you, baby
I need you, honey, all right
Sing it with me now

I struck it rich when I found you, baby
Oh, I'm wealthy cause I'm healthy
And you're so young

I struck it rich when I found you, baby
Cause my name is on the tip of your tongue

288,The Other Side Of This Life,"Would you like to know a secret just between you and me
I don't know where I'm going next, I don't know who I'm gonna be
But that's the other side of this life I've been leading
That's the other side of this life

Well my whole world's in an uproar, my whole world's upside down
I don""t know where I'm going next, but I'm always bumming around
And that's another side to this life I've been leading
And that's another side to this life

Well I don't know what doing for half the time, I don't know where I'm going
I think I'll get me a sailing boat and sail the Gulf of Mexico
But that's another side of this life I've been leading
And that's another side of this life

Well I think I'll go to Nashville down in Tennesse
The ten cent life I've been leading here gonna be the death of me
But that's the other side of this life I've been leading
And that's another side to this life

Would you like to know a secret just between you and me

289,The Dangling Conversation,"[Verse 1]
It's a still life water color
Of a now late afternoon
As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room
And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar
In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives

[Verse 2]
And you read your Emily Dickinson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost
Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time
And the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives

[Verse 3]
Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""
And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow
I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me
Lost in the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
In the borders of our lives",Simon & Garfunkel,1966,"[32, 25, 25, 34, 57, 70, 92]",7
290,Summertime,"[Intro]
Drums Please!

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

Sad he’s always screaming at me
They wanna puncture me and then wonder why I bleed

Step on my ladder and bathe in glory
Inject my soul with darkness
And take my heart and go market it

Take a swing at me, I’ll fight till the death

So ghetto but  she turned me onto Jean-Michel

When I bought my first beamer I swear that bitch was there

298,Only When You're Lonely,"[Verse 1]
When you're all out of cash and all out of love
You're all out of beer, you're stoned and you're fucked
And scared to be alone
You're scared to die alone

The TV is off, the late shows are on
You can't seem to sleep
You can't seem to talk
To your friends back home
You're scared to die alone

[Chorus]
Let somebody else take your feet off the ground
If God’s so damn wise, why am I still around?
To choke on your sins, tasting bitterness
The voice in my head sings me to bed every night

[Verse 2]
I saw you down town
Your clothes were all ripped
You still look so good but your hair looked like shit
You're sacred to be alone
So come back home

'Cause you think you're a dime, a seven at best
Do you still remember when I was around?
You're scared to be alone
I lost my way home

[Chorus]
Let somebody else take your feet off the ground
If God’s so damn wise, why am I still around?
To choke on your sins, tasting bitterness
The voice in my head sings me to bed every night

[Bridge]
(The voice in my head lays me to sleep
The voice in my head lays me to sleep
The voice in my head lays me to sleep
The voice in my head lays me to sleep)

And when we're out of liquor
I wish you wouldn't tell me anything
Because I'm sick of hearing the same God damn thing)

If God’s so damn wise, why am I still around?

299,It Was A Very Good Year,"[Verse]
When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen
When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one
When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five
But now the days grow short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
And it poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year
It was a mess of good years",Ray Charles,1966,"[99, 100, 44, 30, 28, 31, 37, 47, 58]",9

I don't think little big girls should
Go walking through these spooky old woods alone

What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
Little Red Riding Hood
Even bad wolves can be good

I'll try to be satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
So just to see that you don't get chased
I think I ought to walk with you for a way

I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Until I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walking with you alone

Little Red Riding Hood
I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf so I won't

What a big heart I have
The better to love you with

Even bad wolves can be good

My pen don't write when the rhyme gets tough
My worry's too big when the trouble's so small
When it really doesn't matter at all

And I could get by without all those things
That the colorful ads in the newspaper brings
The toaster don't pop and the freezer don't freeze
You can give them all to charity

But I couldn't live without your love
Without your love I'd fade away
I couldn't live without your love everyday
I couldn't live without your love
Without your love I'd surely die
I couldn't live without your love in my life

I could get by without all the gold
The price is gonna drop so I've been told
My credit gets stuck in the credit machine
But it really doesn't matter to me

And I could get by without the glitter of fame
The show don't have to draw when it bears my name
'Cause glitter don't melt when I hold it tight
No, I won't be needing fame tonight

But I couldn't live without your love
Without your love I'd fade away
I couldn't live without your love everyday
Baby, I couldn't live without your love

And I thought I could tell that you did
My heart told me all was well

From the deepest part of me
There came a melody
Complete with harmony
As my heart played for me
A symphony

I remember all the times
You told me that you were mine
And I remember what it did to me

From the deepest part of me
There came a melody
Complete with harmony
As my heart played for me
A symphony

But when I found your goodbye note
When I read the things you wrote
When I knew that you had gone from me

From the deepest part of me
Came tons of tragedy

303,Go Ahead And Cry,"[Verse 1]
Love can change a young boy into a man
But a broken heart can change a man back into a boy again
You're not the first man to cry when things have gone wrong
You're only human, you're only so strong
It takes more than a tear to knock a big man down
It takes more broken hearts to keep him down on the ground
It takes three little words to make him stand again

[Chorus]
So cry
Go ahead and cry, cry

[Verse 2]
Love is so easy to play but so hard to read
You're still a young man, your heart will love again
It takes more, little kiss from her sweet tender lips
It takes more, gentle touch from her soft finger tips
It takes more than one tear to mend a broken heart

[Chorus]

Go ahead and cry, cry
Go ahead and cry
Don't be ashamed to cry, cry",The Righteous Brothers,1966,"[40, 30, 38, 48, 59, 72]",6

Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing

Wild thing

[Verse 2]
Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night?""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing

Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

[Hook]
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""

Somewhere, my love, there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hopes of Spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold

Someday we'll meet again, my love
Someday whenever the Spring breaks through

Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Till then, my sweet, think of me now and then
Godspeed, my love, till you are mine again

Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who, and what was what
Man look at these suckers

It just so happens that I know how to rap
OKAY, I'M RELOADED!

I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gon' ever fall off?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
... A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck
But only a single goin' gold?
If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O?
For the millionth time, asking me questions
Like Wendy Williams, harassing me
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve
Ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?
What you doin in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses?
Latinos and Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico
I'll answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is, ""How bad you wanna know?""

Niggas don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
And don't listen to the rappers yo, they dying to floss
I used to be O.T., applyin' the force
Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss
Come back with the clique playing Diana Ross
I'm the boss and this is how it's gon' be
Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V
I got mouths to feed 'til they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read, ""He was holdin' no leaks""
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the O.G
On MTV, telling 'em how I sold D
And used to bag work up out of apartment 4-B
Me and my homie, started out co-d's
Picked the mailbox lock 'cause I ain't have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'

316,The Tip Of My Fingers,"I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
My eyes had a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands",Bill Anderson,1966,"[51, 43, 45, 48, 48, 59, 79]",7
317,Misty,"[Verse 1]
Oh, Honeybear, Honeybear, Honeybear
Mascara, blood, ash and cum
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love
Honeybear, Honeybear, Honeybear
Fuck the world, damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way
But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I wanna watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked, getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden-variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in ""I-told-you-so"" voice:
""It’s just how we expected""

[Chorus 1]
Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

[Verse 2]
You're bent over the altar and the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising? Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome, boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

[Chorus 2]
But everything is fine
Don't give into despair
'Cause I love you, honeybear

318,Distant Shores,"Have you forgotten your promise that night
Follow your fate into the light

The moments before you went away
I still remember your laughter
My eyes open wide shocked
Of what I wasn't able to avoid
All the gone they wait for me
They wait on distant shores
Death's the gate and I'm the key
With craving’s driving force

All the gone they're calling me
They call from distant shores
I leave without remorse

Pass all these days pass all my longing
I draw the line
To end what should have been done so long ago
My fading memories force me to go
Where my feelings can resist

I'm on my way
On my way to you
I can't wait to
Have you all around

I'm on my way

My heart's been broken in too many pieces
And It's too soon to know

Time passes slow will I ever know
If I can forget her and not let it show
But it's too soon to know

News travels fast when a love affair ends
People keep asking what happened to them

But it's too soon to know it I can forget her

322,I'm Your Hoochie Cooche Man (Part 1),"A Valentine’s Playlist is an important part of your romantic night together. While it can be used in many ways, like in your car as you drive to dinner or a concert, it works best as a mood-setter for a quiet night at home together. The playlist is the background to your own expression of romance, but it serves as a subliminal message of your love and affection.

Assembled here are two playlists, and two points of view – one, a man, the other, a woman. Your playlist will be your own feelings and expression, but these can serve as inspiration and maybe remind you of the special songs you want on your own.
A Man’s ViewGuys love sex almost as much as food. (Some claim they love sex even more than food, but really, they just love the thrill of the hunt for sex, and after the sex, they’ll go have some food to celebrate.) Guys also know that women secretly love bad boys, so your playlist has to convey that undertone early and often to impart a sense of danger. You just can’t do that with classical music; save that for Sunday morning. No, the best music to express that bad boy image is rock. You can go with any of its variants, from country rock to southern rock to rockabilly to punk to indie, but keeping an edge to it will serve you well.

The playlist must have four parts too:

Flirtation – Sets the mood for romance
Seduction – Lets her know she’s the only one you desire
Surrender – Helps her release her inhibitions and beg you for the coup de grâce
Te Amo Mi Amor– Time to express your love and fidelity

""She's Too Good For Me"" -- by Warren Zevon -- Why It's HereA Woman's View:Throughout music, we generally find the male charming the female, while the ladies are most known for their mournful breakup songs. However, this doesn't mean that women don't crave intimacy with their companions (while it lasts). A woman loves to play innocent and seduce her man through subtle implications that escalate to full-blown love. She is determined to leave a legacy in her companion's mind, and most of all, make him feel. She voices her feelings of devotion, and most of all, her wish for her Valentine to reciprocate these feelings.
A Woman's Playlist:There is no better way to beckon him than through a dance floor, be it through upbeat pop or classic jazz. Yes, even if you need to learn a mating dance like a certain species of sexy bird to get his attention, put some swing into it for V-Day. There are a number of moods you could use to get him on the stage to get the love felt:
Upbeat /energetic: If he is the straight-forward type, he is likely more responsive towards a blaring and blunt track that screams ""LOVE ME AND TOUCH ME!"" or ""I LOVE YOU SO IT'S YOUR TURN TO RECIPROCATE!""Intimate confessing: These songs are far more mellow and often contain subtle implications of what the artist really wants. The declaration of love and the invitation for it are expressed nonetheless.

Upbeat/energetic:
""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)"" --
by Whitney Houston -- Why it's Here
""Closer"" -- by Tegan and Sara -- Why It's Here

Point / Counterpoint

Point:
""She is determined to leave a legacy in her companion's mind""
- Angela Ding
Legacy schmegacy, Angela. Men know that women want commitment and security. (They have an instinctual need to nest.) Women won't have sex with men at the drop of a hat; they need to know there's a real connection and real emotion. I'll bet it was women that invented Valentine's Day idea to begin with. You ladies created a whole ritual around love itself, and then insist that we guys express our feelings. It isn't bad enough that we have to show our feelings (and thus become vulnerable to your rejection), you have to layer onto the whole thing that there be a legacy to our relationship - that we have to carry our devotion to you around with us in a sling bag, long after you're gone, to share with the next woman who comes down the pike.

Counterpoint:
""Hi, I'm George, and I like you, but I like sex so much more, so let me seduce you with bad-boy music."" If you think that's the way to a woman's heart, then bravo. Hardcore music doesn't go very far if you also want it to have those ""Te Amo Mi Amor"" undertones. Nice attempt at painting a bad-boy image with romantic setting, but charming women through a four-step guide of confessions just to snatch us for a bodily release is just superficial.

If you want a one-night stand, then of course women need to mean something to the male, and being a part of him is a greater proof of devotion. What you view as ""baggage"" is a memory of what used to be. Or, in the male's standards, as long as the sex was great, right?About the Authors:

Angela Ding and George Plant are regular contributors here at Genius.  As you could tell from their position statements and annotations , they role-played  stereotypical characters for this article.  Their relationship is collegial; they have no personal or romantic (or even adversarial) relationship.

The underlying message here was that, in a relationship, we each have many sides to our personalities.  While men are often painted one way and women another, it's best to simply be ourselves. If someone finds you attractive, good for you. If you both find each other attractive, well then, maybe you've really got something there worth developing together!

You think you'll find what you're looking for

I know your heart's not sure
So before you go
There's something I must say

This door swings both ways
And it's always open night or day
You will always hold the key
You can come back home to me
This door swings both ways

Did I close you in when I built my world around you?
If you felt you were  a prisoner
I didn't know
Go on and find your freedom if you have to
Cause I love you enough to let you go

CHORUS
This door swings both ways
And its always open night or day
You will always hold the key
You can come back home to me

332,Tar And Cement,"Verdelle Smith
Miscellaneous
Tar And Cement
Tar and Cement
Verdelle Smith
The town I came from was quiet and small
We played in the meadows where the grass grew so tall
In summer the lilacs would grow everywhere
The laughter of children would float in the air
As I grew older I had to roam
Far from my family, far from my home
Into the city, where lives can be spent
Lost in the shadows of tar and cement

Chorus:
And every night I'd sit alone and learn
What loneliness meant
Up in my rented room above the world
Of tar and cement
Each day I'd wake up and look at the sky
Think of the meadows where I used to lie
Then I'd remember all of that's gone
You're in the city, you better push on
Get what you came for, before it's too late
Get what you came for, the meadows can wait
Repeat Chorus
Many years later, tired at last
I headed for home to look for my past
I looked for the meadows, there wasn't a trace
Six lanes of highway had taken their place
Where were the lilacs and all that they meant
Nothing but acres of tar and cement
Yet I can see it there so clearly now
Where has it gone?
Yes I can see it there so clearly now
Where has it gone?
Where are the meadows? (tar and cement)
Where are the lilacs? (tar and cement)
And where is the tall grass? (tar and cement)
The laughter of children? (tar and cement)
Nothing but acres (tar and cement)
Acres and acres.....(fade to end)",Verdelle Smith,1966,"[56, 38, 39, 42, 53, 61, 68, 79]",8

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Refrain]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)

334,Out Of This World,"[Verse 1]
Get money addict, I'mma get ""Money"" tatted
Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leecher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead, you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy but Rocky been Jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met J-Hov

[Chorus]
(Who dat? ASAP) But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, Blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No, it ain't a movie, diamonds in by new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I do things, let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne
Fly kicks, my shit, yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, save the bullshit for the q-tips
Swag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin' on the block like Whoo Kid
ASAP standing on the block like the new kids",A$AP Rocky,1966,"[67, 70, 74, 86]",4

Still trying to fill your place
It's not like it was just yesterday

[Bridge]
Is it a waste of time, trying to make this right?
I've got no peace of mind, if you're not in my life
Should I let you go, and be with someone new?
Should I say, I'm happy for you?
And pretend, I'm happy for you?

Ow!

When she walks by
She brightens up the neighbourhood
And every guy would take her hand
If he just could, if she just would

Some sweet day
I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo
And every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time at rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

[Chorus 1]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to give me kicks and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

[Verse 2]
When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness
Is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes
At who is most to blame today

[Chorus 2]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much, when told that such a tender touch of hers
Will make them not the same

[Verse 3]
And when the morning of the warning's passed the gassed and flaccid kids
Are flung across - the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone the songs are left unsung
And hung upon - the scars

[Chorus 3]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes, reflect the lies, and make them realize
Their urgent cry for sight no more

When we met I was sure out to lunch

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

360,Love Letters,"[Verse 1]
The drum is never the enemy of the pen
But when I’m meeting mentally with beat and melody then
One of me can turn into ten of me
If there’s ten of me, tell me how many heavenly similes can we blend?
Like women and men would fall with no friends
Like a rose would fall with no stem
Like most folks follow trends
Like Os follow LMNs
That’s how well I know life flows with the elements
As sunrise kills an evening
As stars die and a night sky is grieving
As man sees what he has when it’s leaving
You gone is as asthma to breathing
That’s how much I need you in my life
I’m never gonna ever leave you in my lifetime
Cause every time I hear line that shows me I’m not alone it’s saving me
Cause I know that that’s a lifeline
Like minds—this is our home and they won’t ruin it easily
Cause the wolf is gonna blow until he’s blue in the cheek
And me and you and the crew can go take a snooze in the street
And the bulldozer can come chew on our feet
We never let em through
We’ll build a levy
Limit the river’s level
Steady the flood and begin with a pebble
Lend me one syllable
Come if you’re ready to shovel
Run if you’re shaking
But I know that today is not my Waterloo

[Chorus]
You’ve made a place where I’m welcome
And although I give voice to it seldom
Know I love you
Nobody’s above you
And if you love someone then you tell them

[Verse 2]
Every day the planet’s losing IQ points
But people still bumping Ice Cube joints
So I’ve got hope
And every day I’m seeking my true voice and looking up at a bright new choice
Cause everybody’s got a hustle and everyone’s trying to push it
It’s tricky to find the kush hiking up a mountain of bullshit
And there’s another mountain of bullshit next to it littered with glitter, money
And strippers they’re selling as good shit
It’s nothing new up at the core though
Everything same as it’s always been only more so
Of course so same token, while there’s life there is truth
While there’s truth it demands to be spoken
And someone’s gonna speak it
It’s really not a secret
You just need to search it
You just need to seek it
And though we like to worship a genius in a coffin
We often forget that there’s prophets among us walking
And I know because I hear em when I am in the clouds
And I got my music up and jamming it loud
And dammit whatever I am or could ever become I’m positive that I will
Always be a fan in the crowd
So gimme gimme gimme

So if you’re blocking the future I wanna to walk toward
Suit yourself we’re gonna lock swords
But it’s a wash if you’re saying “Watsky I could rock withcha if you didn’t talk

But you’ll trip if you don’t try to fit
Maybe you can make it if you ghostwrite a hit
And sell it to somebody who can ghostride a whip”
Shieeet—I say no sirree
I can smell the weak shit through the potpourri
So I’m just gonna do what I do
You take a minute or two and Google “Tim and Magoo”
I love the life that I picked even if it ain't plush
I’m too glad to complain much
I’m in the lab in a drab world
While these fuckers dab and do dabs and I dab on my pad with my paintbrush
This is for the kids whipping up some home-cooked
Spitting 86 bars, fuckin no hook
Lying in the grass
Passion in their chest
And a ballpoint pressed in their notebook
Listen to me, this is for the word
Looking so fine I’m rubbing coconut oil up in the crack of that spine

The love once I felt
I don't feel anymore for you
This time I'll even open the door for you
You walked out when I was down
Well, now I'm well off
And look, look who's coming 'round

Where were you when I needed ya
Where were you when I wanted ya
Where were you when I needed ya
Where?

You're looking good
It's hard to fight it
There's no use explaining
I've already decided
That living with you
Is worse than without you
I won't spend a lifetime a-worriying about you
Things get rough and you disappeared
Now I'm back on my feet
And look, look who is standing there

Where were you when I needed ya
Where were you when I wanted ya
Where were you when I needed ya
Where?

You were so young and you were so wild
I knew you were nobody's innocent child
The first day I saw you
You really got to me
I thought I could change you
What good did it to me?
Things got rough and you couldn't wait
Now you're tripping back
But babe, babe it's too late

362,5 D (Fifth Dimension),"Oh how is it that I could come out to here
And be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention

All my two dimensional boundaries were gone
I had lost to them badly
I saw the world crumble and thought I was dead
But I found my senses still working

And as I continued to drop through the hole
I found all the surrounding
To show me the joy that innocently is
Just be quiet and feel it around you

And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder my teacher's had made
Scientific delirium madness

I will keep falling as long as I live
All without ending
And I will remember the place that is now
That has ended before the beginning

Oh how is it that I could come out to here
And be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention",The Byrds,1966,"[69, 44, 44, 54, 74]",5

This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

Still strove with his last ounce of courage

No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can't buy

379,(I Washed My Hands In) Muddy Water,"I was born in Macon, Georgia
They kept my Daddy in the Macon jail
He said, Son, if you keep your hands clean, uh huh
You won't hear those bloodhounds on your trail

I fell in with bad companions
I robbed a man up in Tennessee
And I got caught way up in Nashville, uh huh now
And they locked me up and threw away the key

I washed my hands in muddy water
I washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
I tried to do like my daddy told me, now
I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

I asked the jailer, said Whens my time up?
He said Son, you know we won't forget
And if you try and just keep your hands clean, uh huh
Why we may just make a good man of you yet

But I didn't wait to get my time in
I broke down, broke out the Nashville jail
I just crossed Atlanta, Georgia, oh now

395,Rain,"[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

A tramp dies in an alley
A young man rapes a girl
Children are born without arms
Someone dies with Leukaemia

Try it more!

Ignoring is our murder

398,Let's Go Get Stoned,"[Intro]
I swear sometimes you're taking me for granted
I swear sometimes you're a whore
I swear, but I know there ain't no reason
'Cause everything is such a bore

[Verse 1]
Last night I had a dream, though it made me sick
Saw you in your bedroom sucking someone else's dick
(My goodness!)
My friends all laughed, said it was my fault
Said it's time that it happened to me
But I know that the show was much more than a blow
So I'm waiting for the tide to get low
I'm waiting for the tide to get low

""Damn... Now lick my balls.""
""The rhythm, the rebel.""
""The rhythm, the rebel.""
""I said suck the motherfucker. You bitin' it, shit!""

[Verse 2]
If I was an ant crawlin' upon the wall
Tell me, baby, would it make no difference, at all?
If I was a roach on a tree, tell me, would you smoke me?
Bright lights put me in a trance
But it ain't house music
Makes me want to dance
(Word)
I don't gamble, but I bet
I'm gonna die if I don't get a cigarette
Just because I always play the mack
With a monkey on my back

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Is that the one that she lives in?

The ""un-love"" affair will soon be forgot
And you will miss me, but i won't miss you
You can pull the key, cause now we're through

Please be the air
Shake the pillars that have held up this awful space

I have love for the lost

You hosted me kindly
You scored my timid throat
Your stillness has haunted all vulnerable eyes
Leaving expressions on top on top of all tongues
With an innocence that kills
Innocence that enhances thoughts
Devoted dancer of deep song
Robust and quaint
And there’s those morning that crawl
Buried way deep down under my skin
Parallel with my bones wild as a vessel
The tides have been pulling me in
Drunk of salt water full of flies
Drowning forgetting my dreams
You have killed me with your fragile hands
We are armies of active minds

When every night and day I had to live the life of a lonely one

I remember meeting you, discovering love could be so true
When shared by two instead of only one

When you said you loved me
(When you said you loved me)
And we could not be parted
(We could not be parted)

I said, I built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I've never felt like this before
Loving you has made my life so much sweeter than ever

Each night I pray we never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger from day to day
As best I can, how I try to reassure you, satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost if you went away
(Went away)

'Cause I really need you
(Really really need you)
And I need for you to need me too
(Need for you to need me too)

I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, yes it has
Since I'm loving you, my life is so much sweeter than ever

'Cause I really love you
(Really really love you)
Girl, I'm thankful that you love me too
(Thankful that you love me too)

I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
And I'm truly glad I found you

419,Day For Decision,"Don't really have the courage
To stand where I must stand
Don't really have the temperament
To lend a helping hand

May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day

I don't know why I've come here
Knowing as I do
What you really think of me
What I really think of you

For the millions in the prison
That wealth has set apart -
For the Christ who has not risen
From the caverns of the heart -

For the innermost decision
That we cannot but obey -
For what's left of our religion
I lift my voice and pray:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
May the light in The Land of Plenty
May the light in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day

I know I said I'd meet you
I'd meet you at the store
But I can't buy it, baby
I can't buy it anymore

And I don't really know who sent me
To raise my voice and say:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day

And if you need a quick reaction
If you're tired of bein' lonely

Got a love inside, that's pure as gold
Take it's yours to have and to hold
And if you do that baby, as we grow old
Tell the greatest story that's ever been told

My heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me

Come closer don't be shy
Stand beneath a rainy sky
The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by
Clear the thistles and brambles
Whistle ""Didn't He Ramble""
Now there's a bubble of me
And its floating in thee
Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say
""It smells like rain today""
God took the stars and he
Tossed 'em can't tell
The birds from the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me
Don't say good bye to me
Describe the sky to me
And if the sky falls
Mark my words
We'll catch mocking birds

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Too bad what's happened to our good love
Sometimes our best isn't quite good enough
And the last word in lonesome is me

The last word in lonesome is me
The last word in lonesome is me
My heart is as lonely as a heart can be lonely
The last word in lonesome is me

Life is a desert and love quenches thirst
Life is a desert and love quenches thirst
We all have to hurt sometime this is my first time
The last word in lonesome is me

The last word in lonesome is me
The last word in lonesome is me
My heart is as lonely as a heart can be lonely
The last word in lonesome is me",Roger Miller,1966,"[47, 40, 47, 47, 52, 60, 82]",7

It's that D-O double 'Bino
Nigga, how you livin'? Yeah, my life so cappuccino
Bittersweet, I'm giving everything I got, I feel so
Helpless, help us, shopping at the Gelson's: soymilk, shellfish
Used to stunt Kitsune, used to date Katsumi
But then I got a new one, but she ain't talking to me
IMessages unread, pain that was unsaid
Laughter that we ain't heard from children we ain't had
I'm a boss, homie. Die a boss like I'm Steve Jobs
They thought I was Jamaican, I got three jobs
They must have been mistaken, I ain't feel ya
They respect the grind and zone 6 lookin' real soft
Dear Mom, you sound sick every time I call
Dad's lying to me, I can hear it in his tone
I don't want nobody help, leave me the fuck alone
Brother holding my head in the shower don't know what I'm on
Rivers running through my nappy afro
Feeling guilty, won the raffle
But the lotto ate my motto at my core
I'm just an apple and they want me PC
Paid for my house but this show is not me
More than the music, we going for that mastery overload
Da Vinci Code comatose to sport a beard like I'm OVO
Got that cream, I'm an Oreo
You know how the story goes
DatPiff four page cause you suck something glory hole
It's that Fresh Prince, Royalty means you deserve it
We were best friends, they talking bout him and I
They loving this silly guy, I'm popping Abilify
Niggas was wildin' out cause they want me so civilized
They say anytime that you getting cheese you in a rat race
Any movies that they offer me is black face
It's so post racial, so I can't prove it
We the same thing, we in the same movement
Business is business, we eating lunch, just not on silent
It's the Diddy and Biggie driving backwards, I'm so iconic
If I'm dead before Detox it doesn't mater, I heard The Chronic
You gon' sell it on eBay, just be glad that I fuckin' signed it
I ain't mad, though, you gotta eat, right?
I know your voice, man, you Marshall Lee, right?
Nah, I'm what you hear in your dreams saying it's not enough
God had made a lot of land, I gotta buy it up
I'm bouncing on the highway, blast it in my driveway
Put that shit on replay, turnt up on agave
Check the kimosabe, my life is so behind me
If you ain't feeling it, come and find me
Come and find me

I saw it in your eyes
Me, I've worn them all

She will never ever know
Give it a million years or so

Me and my policeman
Pulling over everyone we can
Sometimes I breathalyze

This is a national security alert (Remix. Remix. Remix.)
Ground Music. Flip mode. Aftermath. Here we go. (Remix Remix. Remix.)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Real talk word to mother it be the gutter brother (ah!)
Back with another banger to set off the summer (huh!)
Better get up and come a-round
Cause the way our shit will be cloggin up the toilet
You probably should call the plumber
You niggas get dumb and dumber
Thinkin you can come around and test me
Like these other niggas, well, pick a number
I''m sayin you should never ever think that you better nigga
Get it together, been bodyin shit since mommy named me Trevor
Stellar the way I give a hell of a performance and get a
Reaction I attract all the people to come together
Whether niggas realize it or not oppose a letter
Just let a fella think what it wouldn't make him rememeber that
When I'm in the buildin it's cool for you to rest in
Remember I'm too hot to touch kid
Curious, my fire burnin niggas serious
I gift wrapped the flame and give it to niggas, here it is
See through motherfuckers, we'll never be equal
I'll banish and make 'em vanish and do it for (the people)
I be the baddest see when I spit I become the maddest
And kill 'em until the blood'll (seep through)
Front if you want but you know who the top biller
Bounce while I'm killing the strut and walk with a bop, killer!

R-double E-K, D-A Villian
I'll pull a grip out of this waist and splatter ya face
When the cali' blow, you'll get a face shot like a cameo
Rob the man and leave his ass naked like he D'Angelo
Bet I'll let a pistol dismiss you if it's a issue
Of a tissue that money'll get you clapped quick (come on)
Turn a wimp past wittle to a gym class hero
When my AR13'll make 'em backflip (come on)

[Verse 3: Spliff Star]
I'm a BK felon I'll run you down with a weapon
My goonies get looney anytime that I tell 'em
Dead 'em, I walk around with stacks in my denim
With fast foreign cars with the gator skin in 'em
Now I got pretty women all around the world
If I been in your city probably pound your girl
Had her stretched out swimmin in the pool with her breast out
Send her back home set to fire the sex out

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)

Motherfucker, it's FLIPMODE, when I come up in the club
Throwin up a dub, liftin up a snub
Flipmode be stars, you know who the fuck we are
Used to be fishscales, now we fuck with caviar
Eatin on supreme shit, at the round table
On some cream shit, like I grew up in Queensbridge
I talk reckless, the whole world know
My style is C4 and I'm ABOUT TO BLOW
So don't get close, we'll touch ya ribs
And come bust lil' brother with the stick-up kids
Like, ""Shh, take off the watch""
""Shh, take off the watch""
""Shh, take off the watch""

Like boom, guess who stepped in the room
LAX comin' through JFK real soon

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Jump on the track like Michael Jeffrey
Even the referee say I need an ESPY
Award just applaud I'm a boar with a broad
I go hard and my leather so soft and I cough
And the board of health say the boy need help
I am so hot the AM just melt
All aboard, all aboard black card, no fraud
I'm an extension cord, I'm a lightning rod
I'm a lion roar, I'm a dinosaur
I'm a sinus minus the nose, I'm a cold
I'm raw than a temperature rose to five and
Two o's that's 500 degrees for those who know
My fire's higher than a liars
We don't burn rubber, we burn tires
We riders, residers, we live in The Carter
Wayne is a flame that could live in the water
Ok now let's get it straight, either you bait or the mate
Either way you on my plate gettin ate after grace
If you taste like base, snares and tenors be my dinner
I'm hotter in the winter, burn like sinners, turn like spinners
I swear I'll put ya in the urn by your picture
Boy we ain't playin Weezy baby, he the man
Hotter than the Peter pan to a wet bare hand

[Verse 6: Nas]
Man, listen I spot a square dude from a distance
Through the tinted Maybach curtain in partition
Nip/Tuck niggas, I could never fuck with 'em
Or pass the blunt with 'em, let the guns hit 'em
Bring fire, frizzy hair for press-spire
You ain't a rider, pa'tna I'm a crippler
Crutch giver, hospitalizer, hottest whip driver
Keep on my hip, the biggest life or death decider
I ain't a rapper or an activist, I'm badder
I used to run from a cracker named Lieutenant Casper
No black leather jackets or black berets
Since my old days, like I stepped from a Vogue page
And none of y'all cop what I cop
Forget your excuse if the music ain't hot
Where the Range? Where the drops? Y'all never got hoes
See you on the club, wrist never on froze

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)

[Verse 7: Big Daddy Kane]
Busta Bus pick me up in the Coupe to come bubble through
This is routine kid it ain't nothin new
You bring trouble to me, the untouchable
Make me have to bring in the troops like George W
I'll scorch you somethin awful when I fall through
Of course the raw to be when you could put a broad to
Better bring with you your fire extinguisher
Listen, I love static and I'm ready to cling to ya (OK!)
Kid I made it from magazine pages to big stages
High wages through all of the different ages
Thinkin you do it like this is outrageous
Yeah I'm sick with it but it's not contageous
Your hottest thing to me, not a thing
Every night my crib is like the Bada Bing
So make sure that you youngin's got it right
Kane's who's the fuckin rockstars party like, you heard?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You cry when you're confused
You tell your friends when you get mad
You call your mom to make a scene
Yeah you're always coming back

[Chorus]
Don't you come running back, come running back to me
Come running back when you wanna say sorry
Don't you come running back, come running back to me
Come running back 'cause you're lonely and you want me
'Cause you're lonely and you want me

[Bridge]
Now I've left with stuff you own
Now you're sad that you're all alone
I remember all our plans
Us in love and holding hands
I would usually call you then
Say, ""I'm sorry, let's try again""
But instead I lock the door
I've seen it all before

[Outro]
Don't you come running back, come running back to me
Come running back when you wanna say sorry
Don't you come running back, come running back to me
Come running back 'cause you're lonely and you want me

Don't you come running back, come running back to me
Come running back when you wanna say sorry
Don't you come running back, come running back to me
Come running back 'cause you're lonely and you want me

Don't you come running back, come running back to me
Come running back 'cause you're not really sorry",Us The Duo,1966,"[55, 35, 41, 46, 56, 62, 83]",7
470,Wiederseh'n,"Es läuft 'ne Riesenparty
Denn die Alten sind nicht da
Auf 50 Quadratmetern
So an die 200 Mann
Die Ramones ballern aus den Boxen
Es ist genug zu trinken da
Und die Fische vom Bruder
Nehmen ein Whisky-Bad
Mutters Zimmer ist der Knutschraum
Und wer keinen Partner hat
Der sieht sich eben auf Video
Vaters Lieblingspornos an
Die Stimmung ist wirklich bombig
Bis die Wohnungstür aufgeht
Und mit Panik in den Augen
Die Eltern vor uns stehn

Darum sagen wir:
""Auf Wiedersehn
Die Zeit mit euch war wunderschön
Es ist wohl besser
Jetzt zu gehn
Wir können keine Tränen sehn
Schönen Gruß und auf Wiedersehn.""

Aus jahrelanger Erfahrung
Folgt der Rückzug sehr gekonnt
Todessprünge über den Balkon
Und in den Hinterhof
Draußen geht die Feier weiter
Drinnen sieht es traurig aus
Zerstört ist die Familie und das Haus

Die Zeit mit euch war wunderschön
Es ist wohl besser
Jetzt zu gehn
Wir können keine Tränen sehn
Schönen Gruß und auf Wiedersehn.""",Die Toten Hosen,1966,"[63, 57, 60, 73]",4

475,One Too Many Mornings,"Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-falling
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
Yes I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes start to fade
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

It’s a restless hungry feeling
That don’t mean no one no good
When everything I’m a-sayin'
You can say it just as good
You’re right from your side
I'm right from mine
We’re both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind",Bob Dylan,1966,"[95, 95, 96]",3
476,I Need Love,"[Verse 1]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself, ""look what you've done to her""
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make-believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor kissing you on the ear
Whispering, ""I love you and I'll always be here""
Although I often reminsce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

[Hook]
I need love
I need love

[Verse 2]
Romance, sheer delight, how sweet?
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say, ""ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at? You're neither here or there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen?
Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside

[Hook]
I need love
I need love

[Verse 3]
I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you
Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind, moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I've got money, but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget

[Hook]
I need love
I need love

[Verse 4]
See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer
A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl

[Hook]
I need love
I need love

[Outro]
Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting
I love you",LL Cool J,1966,"[98, 100]",2
477,Hand Jive,"[Verse 1]
Before I was born, late one night
My papa said everything's alright
The doctor paid, mama laid down
With a semitone bouncing all around
Cause the beebop stork was about to arrive
Mama gave birth to the hand-jive

[Verse 2]
I could barely walk when I milked a cow
When I was three I pushed a plow
While chopping wood I moved my legs
And they saw me dancing when I gathered eggs
The townfolk clapped, I was only five

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah - everybody
Born to hand-jive, baby
Born to hand-jive, baby - yeah

478,Good Lovin',"[Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'

I need some real good lovin'

Which was kinda weird, 'cause he was yellow too

They called him Irving
Big Irving
Big, short Irving
Big, short, fat Irving
The hundred and forty-second fastest gun in the West

He came from the old Bar Mitzvah spread
With a 10-gallon yarmulke on his head. * (see below)
He always followed his mother's wishes
Even on the range he used two sets of dishes

Big, fat Irving
Big sissy Irving
The hundred and forty-second fastest gun in the West

A hundred and forty-one could draw faster than he
But Irving was looking for one forty-three
Walked into Sol's Saloon like a man insane
And ordered three fingers of two cents plain

484,I Know You Better Than That,"Baby don't be so cruel, I've been waiting on you
Push me up against the wall, Stand me up and drop it all

Waiting on a better day, locked up inside your head
Only giving time of day when you're feeling bad
I don't want your pity, I don't want your fucking words
Make your mind or take me on or leave me for the worms

I'd never love a coward, Ana prove me wrong
I'm just a bastard, but maybe I came on too strong
I only want you to take me for the monster that I am
Stop playing damaged, come on, come on
I know you better than that
I know you better than that

Maybe you don't see as I do, but why must you poke at me and rip me up and make me come unglued
I've always been there when everything is wrong
Asking myself why I'm here and why I'm still strung up

Waiting on a better day, locked up inside your head
Only giving time of day when you're feeling bad
I don't want your pity, I don't want your fucking words
Make your mind or take me on or leave me for the worms

I'd never love a coward, Ana prove me wrong
I'm just a bastard, but maybe I came on too strong
I only want you to take me for the monster that I am
Stop playing damaged, come on, come on

486,Batman & His Grandmother,"[Intro]
I gotta get out of here, this city’s gonna kill me
Could be anywhere
Anywhere but here
I wonder how long before this shit gone take me under

[Verse 1]
Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman movin through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as I'm passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him (Queens)
Forty one times, he committed no crime
But I guess life ain't Times Square
But in the city that’s gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayor’s a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it
And Brooklyn, keep on taking it
Cause life just ain't that fair
For the kids in the park, watching out for the Narcs
Blowing Sour Diesel in the air
Tryin' to flip them a pack, stack up a couple racks
And make it the hell outta here… (New York)

[Hook]
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me, out to me
I can hear them calling out

[Bridge]
Let the city peel away
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me!

[Verse 2]
I maneuver through the ATL in a black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though it’s black top from the mayor to the cops
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house, no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward, these young black boys
Seem to self-sabotage they selves
Or maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston, well it kills itself... (Atlanta)

[Hook]
Let the city peel away right from under you

487,Evol-Not Love,"[Intro]
And I want the congregation to check yourself
Watch who you worship, watch who your children praise!
Like your so-called hometown hero Tech N9ne
That boy ain't nothing but the devil, can I get an amen?
You know I'm right about it
He ain't nothing but a devil boy!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Who the hell is Satan? And why I gotta be him?
I ain't worshiped Nathan, so why you gotta see him?
When you look at me, is it the imagery?
It's gotta be god-l-y, evil's not my energy
I pose as angels clothes is mangled
Instead of Girbaud and Kangols, the ho's still dangle
I chose the angle of souls who tangle
With foe's those who stain your brain so bane though painful
Shit is what they like, hit is what they might
Spit his stuff in life, shit is fuckin' tight
But some people think it's an evil experiment
Some people is fearin' it, those who do Beatles is hearin' it
Sincerity is neezle sin
People who look and never listen
They thinkin' that I'm the tyranny of evil men
But I just tell it like it is dude
My life story's quite gory, spittin' even if it is rude
So ain't no brimstone, I ain't no Jim Jones
So put your grins on, listen to them songs
And you will see that they be classics verbal gymnastics
You call me Lucifer, go to hell you bastard

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hot Christians, pop my disc in
Stop the dissin', squat and listen
I never say hail Satana
I'll never bail out and sell out and sell gay drama
Hey mama, they trying to crucify me like Jesus
Religious groups deny me like skeezers
We mic pleasers, rip it and write heaters
Niggas that ain't pleased, with quickness are light readers
I said Anghellic, then let the man sell it
I let the fans smell it, then I expand relish
But the devil tried to stop me that's JCOR
They thought I'd crumble while it's rocky and stay poor
Deus Vobiscum, we playas go get some sprayers
And hits 'em with layers of slayer inscriptions
That means God be with you, we split dude then hit you
With pistols whip you then giggle never dissing Nizzle again
I talk about the rain, I talk about the sun
I speak about the pain, I speak about the fun
I'm sayin' that I'm bad, I'm sayin that I'm good
I'm saying this to the suburbanites and every hood
Y'all act like I'm sayin' (I love Lucifer, I will kill all of you)
Motherfucker I ain't step into the lime light
To devil worship in front of kids, get your mind right

They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy

And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
They call me devil boy, but I don't like that
Those who recite that, that's where the fights at
'Cause I'm a tight cat, who hella write rap
Even a slight crack, and I'll be right back
To devil worshipers at my signings thinkin' I'm gnarly (huh)
I just wanna go to your parties
So I can run through all your goth bitches, and rock bitches
Take 'em on the block and now they 2Pac bitches
I love the dark side with horror, got archives I'm sure you
Got hard lives, Missourah is our side
And it's hella depressin', hella a stressin'
Retrogression back to depression, a hell of a lesson
This where it gets more sick, don't respect poor pricks
Who listen to this album and then say exorcist
You dense, hence the word 'Ang' it means good
'Hellic' it means bad, you didn't catch it you should have
Idiots make me wanna bust it (rebel toys)
Tried to explain now I say fuck it (several ploys)
Foolish title I can't touch it (devil boy)
'Cause I talk backwards (suseJ sevol uoy)

He said he couldn't love me 'cause he didn't have no money

So, every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry

I got me a boy
I guess I really loved him
Every night now I was thinking of him
But you can't mix love with money
'Cause if you do it's gonna hurt somebody

So, every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some

Although I know that he's just a poor boy
Is it wrong to love 'cause he's not a rich boy?

Even though the love's frail the thug's real
All you gotta do is just follow the blood trail
Much harder fightin when the battle is uphill
- Whatever the knife can't handle the slug will
Keep a good lawyer that's smart work on cases
Still gotta run from the NARCs, they gon' chase us (run)

Before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown
So be careful not to show it

Why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line

Don't believe it's comin' back soon

I just got to let you know that
Baby I can't let you go
I realise I hurt you so
Our love surely can be mended
It's just a little misunderstanding
I remember you said
You would always care
Till death should we two part
And it surely must be my destiny
To dare a devil of a broken heart
So before I became
A wondering over
Let's get together now don't you think oh
Baby I can't let you go
I realise I hurt you so
Our love surely can be mended
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is
We've been loving so long it just seems wrong
That our love should never be
It would be anywhere baby I wouldn't care
If I thought that you needed me
All the chains is the world can't hold me
Like a robot your love controls me",Paul Young,1966,"[85, 86]",2

You are my life...",Don Blackman,1966,"[88, 88, 91]",3
500,He Will Break Your Heart,"[Curtis Mayfield, Calvin Carter and Jerry Butler]

He don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart


Fare thee well, I know you're leavin'
(I know you're leavin')
For the new love that you've found
The handsome guy that you've been dating, whoa
I got a feelin' he's gonna put you down 'cause


He don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart


He uses all the great quotations
Says the things I wish I could say
Whoa, but he's has so many rehearsals
Girl, to him it's just another play but wait


When the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Girl, I'll be there to take you home


He don't love you (and he never will) like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
Oh, he don't love you, girl, like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart


Whoa, he don't love you",Jerry Butler,1966,[91],1
501,Leaning On The Lamp Post,"I'm leaning on the lamp
Maybe you think I look a tramp
Or maybe you think I'm 'round to steal a car
But no, I'm not a crook
And if you think that's what I look
I'll tell you why and what my motives are

I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street

She doesn't always get away

She's not the kind of girl to be late for
But this girl I'd break any date for

My life has one design
A simple little band of gold
To prove that you are mine
Don't want the world to have and hold
For fame is not my line
Just want a little band of gold
To prove that you are mine
Some sail away to Araby and other lands of mystery
But all the wonders that they see will never tempt me
Their memories will soon grow cold

Mama don't want him drinking all the time
Please don't sell my daddy no more wine no more wine
He may be no good but he's still mine
Late one night in Old Joe's friendly barroom
Two men were standin' drinking all alone
Thinkin' of the days they were younger
Talking about the women they had known
When there in the dim light of the tavern
A sweet young girl came softly to their side
And two one man surprised looked upon two tear stained eyes
And saw his own sweet daughter's there a crying
Please don't sell my daddy...
My daddy used to buy me pretty dresses
Now it's only hand-me-downs and worn out shoes
It's because of you I know that I wear these ragged clothes
For you're the man who sells my daddy booze
Her father looked down on the glass that he was holding
As the teardrops trickled down his solemn face
I been here Joe so long now it's time that I was gone
Going home to stay I'll never see this place
Please don't sell my daddy...
Don't you do it don't you do it

510,Love Takes A Long Time Growing,"[Verse 1]
No more love
Just hate growing harder and larger
It's a human mind that locks us away
From love and laughter

All men fighting
[?] forget the future, live in the past
It'll never be over
So kids will learn

[Chorus]
Oh, all the children are gone
Leave their parents alone
They search for a better home
Cause where they live
There its forbidden to dance, listening to music or holding hands
It's forbidden to breathe

They breaking the rules was their daily combat
They had to obey, they had to forget
The fire inside, the passion for life

Oh, all the chilrdren are gone
They search for freedom
They want no one to lead them

[Verse 2]
Fly [?] just a game
No more honor, no shame
We could gamble all we wanted
And maybe some ohter day, but we're playing safe today
And will all day long
They can call us crazy, they can name us wrong
But we're not fighting along
It's a long road, takes a long time
And we're all ready to climb

Oh, all the children are gone
Leave their parents alone
They search for a better home
Cause where they live
There its forbidden to dance, listening to music or holding hands
It's forbidden to breathe

They had to obey, they had to forget
The fire inside, the passion for life

511,Marble Breaks And Iron Bends,"The hollow winds of night no more
In wild, unequal cadence pour,
On musing fancy's wakeful ear,
The groan of agony severe
From yon dark vessel, which contains
The wretch new bound in hopeless chains!
Whose soul with keener anguish bleeds,
As AFRIC'S less'ning shore recedes--

No more where Ocean's unseen bound
Leaves a drear world of waters round,
Between the howling gust, shall rise
The stifled captive's latest sighs!--
No more shall suffocating death
Seize the pent victim's sinking breath;
The pang of that convulsive hour,
Reproaching man's insatiate power;
Man! who to AFRIC'S shore has past,
Relentless, as the annual blast
That sweeps the Western Isles, and flings
Destruction from its furious wings!--
And woman, she, too weak to bear
The galling chain, the tainted air,--
Of mind too feeble to sustain
The vast, accumulated pain,--
No more, in desperation wild,
Shall madly strain her gasping child;
With all the mother at her soul,
With eyes where tears have ceas'd to roll,
Shall catch the livid infant's breath,
Then sink in agonizing death!
BRITAIN! the noble, blest decree
That soothes despair, is fram'd by thee!
Thy powerful arm has interpos'd,
And one dire scene for ever clos'd;
Its horror shall no more belong
To that foul drama, deep with wrong.
O, first of EUROPE'S polish'd lands
To ease the captive's iron bands;
Long, as thy glorious annals shine,
This proud distinction shall be thine!
Not first alone when valour leads
To rush on danger's noblest deeds;
When mercy calls thee to explore
A gloomy path, untrod before,
Thy ardent spirit springs to heal,
And, greatly gen'rous, dares to feel!--
Valour is like the meteor's light,
Whose partial flash leaves deeper night;
While Mercy, like the lunar ray,
Gilds the thick shade with softer day.
Blest deed! that met consenting minds
In all but those whom av'rice binds,--
Who creep in interest's crooked ways,
Nor ever pass her narrow maze;
Or those whom hard indiff'rence steels
To every pang another feels.
For them has fortune round their bowers
Twin'd, partial nymph! her lavish flowers;
For them , from unsunn'd caves, she brings
Her summer ice; for them she springs
To climes where hotter suns produce
The richer fruit's delicious juice;
While they , whom wasted blessings tire,
Nor leave one want to feed desire,
With cool, insulting ease demand
Why, for yon hopeless, captive band,
Is ask'd, to mitigate despair,
The mercy of the common air?

The boon of larger space to breathe,
While coop'd that hollow deck beneath?
A lengthen'd plank, on which to throw
Their shackled limbs, while fiercely glow
The beams direct, that on each head
The fury of contagion shed?--
And dare presumptuous, guilty man,
Load with offence his fleeting span?
Deform creation with the gloom
Of crimes that blot its cheerful bloom?
Darken a work so perfect made,
And cast the universe in shade?--
Alas! to AFRIC'S fetter'd race
Creation wears no form of grace!
To them earth's pleasant vales are found
A blasted waste, a sterile bound;
Where the poor wand'rer must sustain
The load of unremitted pain;
A region in whose ample scope
His eye discerns no gleam of hope;
Where thought no kind asylum knows
On which its anguish may repose;
But death, that to the ravag'd breast
Comes not in shapes of terror drest;
Points to green hills where freedom roves,
And minds renew their former loves;
Or, hov'ring in the troubled air,
Hangs the fierce spectre of Despair;
Whose soul abhors the gift of life,
Who stedfast grasps the reeking knife,
Bids the charg'd heart in torrents bleed,
And smiles in frenzy at the deed!
Ye noble minds! who o'er a sky
Where clouds are roll'd, and tempests fly,
Have bid the lambent lustre play
Of one pure, lovely, azure ray;
O, far diffuse its op'ning bloom,
And the wide Hemisphere illume!
Ye, who one bitter drop have drain'd
From slav'ry's cup, with horror stain'd,
O, let no fatal dregs be found,
But dash her chalice on the ground,
While still she links her impious chain,
And calculates the price of pain;
Weighs agony in sordid scales,
And marks if death or life prevails;
Decides how near the mangling scourge
May to the grave its victim urge,--
Yet for awhile, with prudent care,
The half-worn wretch, if useful, spare;
And speculates, with skill refin'd,
How deep a wound will stab the mind;
How far the spirit can endure
Calamity, that hopes no cure!--
Ye! who can selfish cares forego,
To pity those which others know,--
As light that from its centre strays
To glad all nature with its rays,--
O, ease the pangs ye stoop to share,
And rescue millions from despair!--
For you, while morn in graces gay
Wakes the fresh bloom of op'ning day,
Gilds with her purple light your dome,
Renewing all the joys of home,--
Of that dear shed which first ye knew,
Where first the sweet affections grew;
Whose charm alike the heart can draw,
If form'd of marble or of straw;
Whether the voice of pleasure calls,
And gladness echoes through its walls,
Or to its hallow'd roof we fly
With those we love to pour the sigh;
The load of mingled pain to bear,
And soften every pang we share!--
Ah, think how desolate his state,
How he the cheerful light must hate,
Whom, sever'd from his native soil,
The morning wakes to fruitless toil
To labours hope shall never cheer,
Or fond domestic joy endear!

Poor wretch! on whose despairing eyes
His cherish'd home shall never rise!
Condemn'd, severe extreme, to live
When all is fled that life can give:--
And ah, the blessings valued most
By human minds, are blessings lost!
Unlike the objects of the eye,
Enlarging as we bring them nigh;
Our joys at distance strike the breast,
And seem diminish'd when possest.
Who from his far-divided shore
The half-expiring captive bore?
Those whom the traffic of their race
Has robb'd of every human grace;
Whose harden'd souls no more retain
Impressions nature stamp'd in vain:
As streams that once the landscape gave
Reflected on the trembling wave,
Their substance change when lock'd in frost,
And rest in dead contraction lost;
Who view, unmoved, the look that tells
The pang that in the bosom dwells;
Heed not the nerves that terror shakes,
The heart convulsive anguish breaks;
The shriek that would their crimes upbraid,
But deem despair a part of trade.
Such only for detested gain
The barb'rous commerce would maintain;
The gen'rous sailor, he who dares
All forms of danger, while he bears
The British flag o'er sultry seas,
And spreads it on the Polar breeze;
He to whose guardian arm we owe
Each blessing that the happy know;
Whatever charms the soften'd heart,
Each cultur'd grace, each finer art,
E'en thine, most lovely of the train!
Sweet Poetry, thy heav'n-taught strain,
His breast, where nobler passions burn,
In honest poverty, would spurn
The wealth oppression can bestow,
And scorn to wound a fetter'd foe!
True courage in the unconquered soul
Yields to Compassion's mild control;
As, the resisting frame of steel
The magnet's secret force can feel.
When borne at length to Western lands,
Chain'd on the beach the captive stands,
Where Man, dire merchandize! is sold,
And barter'd life is paid for gold!
In mute affliction, see him try
To read his new possessor's eye;
If one blest glance of mercy there,
One half-form'd tear may check despair!
Ah, if that eye with sorrow sees
His languid look, his quiv'ring knees,
Those limbs which scarce their load sustain,
That form consum'd in wasting pain,
Such sorrow fills his ruthless eye
Who sees the lamb he doom'd to die;
In pining sickness yield his life,
And thus elude the sharpen'd knife.
Or if where savage habit steels
The vulgar mind, one bosom feels
The sacred claim of helpless woe--
If pity in that soil can grow!
Yet why on one poor chance must rest
The int'rest of a kindred breast?
Why yield to passion's wayward laws
Humanity's devoted cause?--
Ah ye, who one fix'd purpose own,
Whose untir'd aim is self alone;
Who think in gold the essence lies
From which extracted bliss shall rise;
Does fleeting life proportion bear
To all the wealth ye heap with care?
When soon your days in rapid flight
Shall sink in death's terrific night,
Then seize the moments in your power,
To Mercy consecrate the hour!
Risk something in her cause at last,
And thus atone for all the past.
Does avarice, your god, delight
With agony to feast his sight?

Does he require that victims slain,
And human blood his altars stain?--
Ah, not alone of power possest
To check each virtue of the breast:
As when the numbing frosts arise
The charm of vegetation dies;
His sway the harden'd bosom leads
To cruelty's remorseless deeds;
Like the blue lightning, when it springs
With fury on its livid wings,
Darts to its goal with baleful force,
Nor heeds that ruin marks its course!
O, Eloquence! prevailing art!
Whose force can chain the list'ning heart;
The throb of sympathy inspire,
And kindle every great desire;
With magic energy control,
And reign the sov'reign of the soul!
That dreams, while all its passions swell,
It shares the power it feels so well:
As visual objects seem possest
Of those clear hues by light imprest.
O, skill'd in every grace to charm,
To soften, to appal, to warm,--
Fill with thy noblest rage the breast,
Bid on those lips thy spirit rest,
That shall, in Britain's Senate, trace
The wrongs of AFRIC'S captive race!--
But Fancy o'er the tale of woe
In vain one heighten'd tint would throw;
For ah, the truth is all we guess
Of anguish in its last excess!
Fancy may dress in deeper shade
The storm that hangs along the glade;
Spreads o'er the ruffled stream its wing,
And chills awhile the flowers of spring;
But where the wint'ry tempests sweep
In madness o'er the darken'd deep,--
Where the wild surge, the raging wave,
Point to the hopeless wretch a grave;
And death surrounds the threat'ning shore--
Can fancy add one horror more?--
Lov'd BRITAIN ! whose protecting hand,
Stretch'd o'er the globe, on AFRIC'S strand
The honour'd base of freedom lays,
Soon, soon the finish'd fabric raise!
And when surrounding realms would frame,
Touch'd with a spark of gen'rous flame,
Some pure, ennobling, great design,
Some lofty act, almost divine,

Once, there was this kid who
Took a trip to Singapore and brought along his spray paint

Once there was this girl who
Swore that one day she would be a figure skating champion

She saw some other girl who was better
And so she hired some guy to
Club her in the knee cap

514,You Waited Too Long,"(""If you think your marriage is so great, why the fuck are you turning to other people's wives for comfort? ""
""Can... can I tell you what, what was going on here? ""
""Yeah, please do."")

Did he really get to take you home?
I'm surprised that you chose him
Surprised that I'm not in a halfway home
I'm not surprised I never saw you around
When they brought me home

So who does this separation work for?
So which one of us will wage war, war?
It's not about the feelings that we shared before, no
'Cause your words don't calm anymore, no more
What did you want me for?

How do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too long

And did you really think I'd take it?
When information fabricated
Look, I give you credit for pathetically thinking
That you could make this up, watch this
She turns about face
He stays in her house, invading your space
Helpless, you know that I'm away
A mac truck sitting in a hotel, crazy
Red light on the phone
Blinking like it's telling me
There's something wrong or right, you don't
I need to know

How do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too long

How do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too-
Yeah, you waited too long

This is urgent
Call 'em emergencies
I don't know how to stop 'em
More cap-gun than a pistol
You fill your clip with lies
Then load each one and fire right over my head

I need a finish line, this pressure's too high
I should have seen the end was coming sooner than I ever did
Reached down to the pit of my soul
I found things that I didn't wanna know were there
I guess the wait is over

Oh, how do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too long

Oh, how do you call
What we have love when you don't even notice
The look upon my face?
Yeah, I've done this before
You'll be sorrier when I'm gone
Yeah, you waited too long",Blue October,1966,"[94, 94]",2
515,Love's Made A Fool Of You,"Love can make a fool of you
You do anything it wants you to

You know love's made a fool of you

You know love makes fools of men
But you don't care, you're gonna try it again
Time goes by, it's a-passing fast

Your crazy love has made you blind

You can't make up your mind about this or that, or anything at all
So you go with the flow and hope to God that no one knows it

Everything you are, everything you say
Everything you do is not for you
Everything you feel, everything you know
You found it on your favorite TV show

[Chorus]
And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look

[Verse 2]
You're telling everyone how different that you really are
But it's been said before, so maybe you're not special after all
If you put the same amount of effort into letting go
Just act yourself and you might like it, you never know
'Cause everything you want, everything you do
You try so hard to be everyone but you
Everywhere you turn, you just got to learn
It's easier if you don't try so hard

[Chorus (2x)]
And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look
And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look
And it's people like you that make me sick
I'm surrounded by you everywhere I look
Is there somewhere I can go to get away
Where there's truth and people mean just what they say?

You try too hard
You just try too hard

I'll regret I said goodbye
I remember cherry kisses and I'll cry
But I can't go on pretending
That our love is never ending

Trying to find a beacon in my life

I have to blame myself

527,Remember The Rain,"[Intro]
I’d like to dedicate this right here (Yea, this right here)
To all my women that going through a struggle
You know I came up to stay
I ain’t immune to the type of pain you’ve been exposed to
So this one right here
I’mma represent for each and one of y’all who have cancer
Yea, let’s go to my single mothers
Raising the house for the kids (no daddies)
Even the ones who’ve been beat up and abused
Break and left for loss
You know? Even the babies out here havin’ babies
I understand this a part of reality
Even my women don’t lie
All for protecting their set

[Verse 1]
He said he’d never touch you again
He left you prayin’ for the lord to get richer
A thousand tears leaving your face for every time that he hits her
Still so far from happy days but nowhere close to a smile
Try my good what affected you this shit in front of your child
Everything inside your heart telling you pack up and go
But the hardest thing out your life is tryna walk out that door
Cuz once you leave you know it ain’t no turning back, you gotta move on
Don’t worry ‘bout the stressing because you know that you strong
Go sit to a queen therefore you kind now put that shoe on
And walk in it with pride for all the pain and hurt that you saw
Come on! Past situations got you with your head lower
Looking at the girl in the mirror you swear you don’t know ‘er
They strugglin’ makes a woman at a faster rate
Even if she spiritually damaged it make her spirit great
Give me a chance, a real nigga step into the place
Set shine to whole before it’s too late

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever
Instead of raining tears away they think you gotta pray to get better
The sun gon shine on you no matter the weather
It ain’t a day to come that I don’t wanna see you smile
I know you on a road that won’t be endin’ for a while
I’mma hally at the homie at above for ya on your head
Real niggas got love for ya

[Verse 2]
I know you goin’ through it for real
So words can’t express how I feel
Each and every one of your struggles makes you one in a mill
I know it’s hard bein’ alone raising a house full of kids
And every day you do your best to try to handle your bizz
Not knowin’ how you gon survive so you turn to strippin’ or drugs
Couple pills to compensate in the place of lookin’ for love
It don’t matter where you been, you just need to know where you goin’
You wearin’ your body red, I’m tellin’ ya cuz it’s showin’
Everybody get a second chance plus it ain’t no room to be a victim of a circustance
You’re something special, Jesus put you here to handle pressure
He’d make that, listen, if you think you’re slippin’ He won’t let ya
And do the babies even know that weak ass daddies love ‘em? They steal the blisten
They angels in disguise that’s why I ride without a question
If you ever catch a person tryna treat you like trash
Halla at me, I’d come kick their ass

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever
Instead of raining tears away they think you gotta pray to get better
The sun gon shine on you no matter the weather

I know you on a road that won’t be endin’ for a while
I’mma hally at the homie at above for ya on your head
Real niggas got love for ya

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no way to take back a life full of drama
Speaking for the streets, I must apologize
Don’t think you’re alone, I lost 2 sisters to a homicide
This my testimony to let you know how much you mean
You can be whatever you dream
You gotta know that you’re better than this so stop with the lies
You say it’s all good, I can see the doubt in your eyes
I know you’re fightin’ for your life so why you actin’ surprised?
You gotta wake up ‘fore you end up somewhere hospitalized
And I don’t wanna see it
I know the rain is so familiar, step inside, take a seat
Let it out until they feel your son is on the way
And through the faith you bound to see the better days
That there’s enough to get you move like in so many ways
That’s why I dedicate this song for the life that you been through
And every obstacle in life that you might just run into
You made too many, who can fill up your space?
So you deserve to put a smile on your face
Come on

[Hook]
Baby girl dry your eyes, you gotta try to keep it together
They told me pain don’t last forever

And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""

Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels

Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow
You can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

The midnight train is whining low

When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds

When leaves begin to die?

Lights up a purple sky

536,A Sign Of The Times,"As bizarre, self-contradictory, and refutable as his pronouncements are, Douglass is not an isolated crackpot. Not only does his material readily get published but it also has been widely propagated among Black prisoners. In addition, his program is in perfect harmony with the politics of Lyndon LaRouche, a notorious neo-Nazi with documented links to U.S. intelligence agencies. Somehow, for 28 years now, LaRouche has always had plenty of money for a host of slick publications and for a series of front organizations that operate on a national and international scale. 39

LaRouche's ""National Democratic Party Committee"" organized the intensely homophobic campaign in 1986 for Proposition 64 in California, which would have mandated an AIDS quarantine. (Fortunately the voters rejected this measure.) The ""scientific"" source the LaRouchites used for their reactionary campaign was Robert Strecker, MD. Douglass has worked closely with Strecker, considers him a mentor, and dedicates End of Civilization to him.

We live in a strange and dangerous period when the attractive mantle of ""militant anti-government movement"" has been bestowed on ultra-right wing, white supremacist groups. The only reason they can get away with such a farce is that their big brother – the police state – did such an effective job in the blood-soaked repression of the genuine opposition, such as the Black Panthers, rooted in the needs and aspirations of oppressed people. With people's movements silenced, the right has coopted the critique of big government and big business to achieve new credibility.

The resurgence of the ultra-right is based on growing discontent. The previous guarantee of economic security and significant privileges for a wide range of middle and working class white people has become threatened by global capital's relentless quest to boost profits. The right wing, however, portrays the threat as primarily coming from the inroads made by women, immigrants and people of color. Thus their vehemence and militancy springs from the same legacy of white supremacy and violence that is the basis of the government they criticize, and their program is in essence a call far a return to the pioneer days' ethos that any white male had the right and power to lay a violent claim to Native American land or New Afrikan labor, and female subservience. In short, while capitalizing on legitimate anger against the establishment, the far right's logic leads only to an intensification of white supremacy and violent repression.

Michael Novick reported in White Lies/White Power (p. 309) that within the far right ""The LaRouche groups are particularly dangerous because, despite their fascist orientation, they have been attempting to recruit from Black groups for some time."" Another source or AIDS conspiracy theorists is the political analysis of Bo Gritz, head of the ""Populist Party."" 40 As Novick's book shows, the ""Populists"" use anti-business rhetoric to try to recruit among the left, but the organization has clear roots in the Klan and definite ties to the extremely white supremacist ""Christian Identity"" movement.

When such forces propagate AIDS conspiracy theories among New Afrikans, one result is to divert people from the grassroots mobilization around prevention and education that could serve to foster greater cohesion, initiative, and strength within the Black community. At the same time, the right fans the flames of homophobia, which has combined with racism within the predominantly white gay & lesbian movement to prevent the forging of a powerful alliance of the communities being decimated by the government's negligence and inaction on AIDS.

Whatever the right's motives are, the practical consequences are clear: There is a definite correlation between believing these myths and a failure to take proven, life saving preventive measures.

Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
Watching the clock till you return
Lighting that torch and watching it burn

I try to pretend

And right there in front of her eyes
There was her loving Johnny

And I found out too late that wasn't right
I'm just now realizing what I lost, that's why I'm crying
And I'm sure gonna miss her, sure gonna miss her, sure gonna miss her every night

I know I took her love for granted
Guess you could say my love was blind
Thought if she left that I could stand it
Or else it didn't matter at the time

I heard she's found a guy that treats her better

565,Homeward Bound,"[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' in the railway station
Got a ticket for my destination, mmm
On a tour of one night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one man band

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Everyday's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines, Mmm
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

[Verse 3]
Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend, mmm
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me

I just kissed the one I love for the last time
Never have her soft lips been so sweet
She's gone away and won't be back forever
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep

I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Not because I'm sad but 'cause I'm weak
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep

Just before she said goodbye she called me darling
And slowly ran her fingers down my cheek
I thought I'd die when she said she still love me
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep

I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Not because I'm sad but 'cause I'm weak

You can't beat the memories you've given me)

Take one fresh and tender kiss
Add one stolen night of bliss
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy
Memories are made of this

Don't forget a small moonbeam
Fold it lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine, two sips of wine
Memories are made of this

Then add the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor

Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams you will savor

With His blessings from above
Serve it generously with love
One man, one wife, one love through life

583,Outside The Gates Of Heaven,"Where is heaven? (In your heart)
Outside, outside, outside, outside

When the angels looked down, they saw you walk away
They knew you hurt me more and more each day

So don't leave me, leave me, leave me all alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me all alone
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven

When the angels looked down, they knew my fate
They cried and cried and cried when you closed the gate

If you'd only say ""Be my, be my baby""
I'd be right there by your side (inside, inside, inside)
Running home (running) to catch you
The gates will open up wide

Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven

Outside, yes I'm outside, oh and all alone (heaven)",Lou Christie,1966,"[69, 45, 48, 49, 57, 75, 90, 97]",8

All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking, ""She don't love him""
Saying that out of my life
Into another's arms, you'll soon be walking

Somebody shake me
Wake me, when it's over, when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when it's over, when it's over

They say our love ain't what it used to be

I close my ears not wanting to hear
But the words are loud and clear

They say, ""She don't love him, she don't love him""
They say my heart's in danger
'Cause you're leaving me for the love of a stranger

Somebody shake me
Wake me somebody when it's over, when it's over
And tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when it's over, when it's over

My whole world you inspire
I can't bear to be losing you

Listening to my neighbors criticize
What a fool I am not to realize
You don't want me by your side

I can't believe, I've been replaced
If I've ever ever dreamed before
Somebody tell me, I'm dreaming now

590,Elusive Butterfly,"[Verse 1]
You might wake up some morning
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

[Chorus]
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

[Verse 2]
You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me running
Through the long abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathing

[Chorus]
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

What will I do when the leaves start falling
The far distant hill will make me feel blue
Soon the flowers will die, don't let love die with them
And with you gone dear, what will I do

Your sweet ruby lips and hair like an angel
And your mornful eyes they keep haunting me
But to know that you're mine it makes life worth living
Oh, the time's gone by, a sweet memory

Trust in me and you'll not be alone

Let it be sure there is a heaven
So let it be, I shall always love you
And if ever I seek out another
And you cry to me that my vows were untrue

Then may my heart be cast into stone
And may the world go blank when I moan
And if I come to you beggin' your help
And forgiveness that I looked on, may I walk alone

Here in your arms, kiss after kiss
I shall live just for moments like this

And the more I said, ""Be in pleasure""
Forever mine, baby, only for you
And if someday the voice of a stranger
Comes beckoning and I say, ""We are through""

Then may my heart be cast into stone
And may the world go blank when I moan
And may I walk down the dark street of sorrow
Without you to take me home, may I walk alone

If the end of the earth comes tomorrow
And we've only a moment or two
If you spend them alone and in sorrow
'Cause I am afraid to die loving you

Then may my heart be cast into stone
And may the world go blank when I moan
And may I walk down the dark street of sorrow
Without you to take me home, may I walk alone

Literally hypothetical
Chemical dependency, the referee is giving me a double technical
You better bet there ain't nobody better
Whether rain or sunny weather, pen an open letter
Been alone, forever be alone, me and being lonesome hella go together
The abominable diabolical
It's a monopoly, I got a monocle
Been at the bottom feedin' with the bottom feeders
A lobotomy is not a reason to cry
Finally got a piece of the pie
I've been seekin' the secret to life
Keepin' in mind, please be advised
Young and freaky people need not apply
Hyperbolic unapolagetic
With the right amount of homicidal
I'ma fight a title fight tonight
About to win the bout upon arrival, save you
Live by the gun, die by the gun
Wish that it was, cry 'cause it ain't
Live like a bum, die like a bum
Did what I done, tried to explain
Hiding in plain sight
Right under stage lights
May bite, you'll be writhing in pain
Ain't like it, then fly like a plane
Why you wanna be a wannabe?
I wanna beat it out of you
I really truly wanna
Gotta do what I gotta do
Bobby Booshay, medulla oblongata
I got a tendency to be the pest
The complexion of a deity
A reflection of my enemies
Wasn't ever what it seemed to be
I got a tendency to get upset and mean, I'm seeing red

Couldn't win a race, look me in the face
Put me in the game, coach
Foes brittle, finna break bones
The flow bitter, got your brain froze
So folks shiver when I play shows
I'm cold, drippin', get a raincoat
Both swimmin' to the same boat
We're no different, gotta go get it
Gotta prohibit what I hate most
On a roll, living in the moment
I'm finna blow any minute
Gold in my ticket
No limit to my bankroll
I'ma lay low for a bit
Not a know-it-all but I came close
Plain clothes in the whip on my way home, stickin' to the main roads
Never been the one to beat around the bush
Say my name, say my name
When I come around you better keep it on the hush
Never in a rut, always in a rush
Roll with us, leave opponents in the dust
When I put the pedal to the floor
This ain't a battle, it's a war
For the record, Acumental settle any score
Better than before
End of the performance, I bet they're begging me for more
Weather any storm like Magellan
Soar like a 747
Clever and poetic with the rhetoric
I'm ready for impending Armageddon
I don't edit what I said
To my credit, if I ever said it then I meant it (Woo)
You're pathetic
Take you to the medic when I put your head up on a plate
Everything is great
Aided and abetted, Term and Ac indebted to the game
Get the fame, get the cheddar, get the cake
Get the bread, I'm 'bout to bake it
'Bout to break it with the fellas
Labeled as a menace
Rake it in, I bet you'll never be the same

When I'm on the mic, I be takin' the piss

Fuck conservatives and liberals
Hey, it's political, no it's not
I don't give a fuck, I just like talkin' that shit
If you're smarter than a fifth grader, why you always actin' like a little kid?
With tantrums at random
Tantric sex with phantoms at operas
Oprah does lots of drugs (What? Huh?)

Rocking boat shoes
And a pocket chain
Eatin' soul food

Head look like a goddamn fuckin' knot

God, I prolly oughta stop
Call a doctor or the coppers
Give me chocolates and a whopper
I'll be outside of your mom's house
With a flamethrower in my boxers
Helicopters overhead overheard what I said and they said
""Absurd, how could anybody say such things?""
Pissed on the lawn, flipped 'em the bird
Then your mom caught a moonfly
Straight to the derriere

[Per-Hook: Keaton Stromberg]
I wanna run wanna run away-ay
I'm dreaming of a place called home
I could try but I'm stuck in today
I'm dreaming of a place that's

[Hook: Wesley Stromberg]
3000 miles away
Feels like it's forever
Seems like yesterday
We were running 'round town together
This place, just ain't the same
I miss the stormy weather
I'm not okay
3000 miles away

[Verse 2: Drew Chadwick]
You don't pick up but I keep redialing
Cause you're asleep got your phone on silent
Still early here I'm wide awake
I just wanna hear you tell me all about your day

[Verse 3: Keaton Stromberg]
Although I never really showed it
I had to leave for me to notice
That living in the sunshine's cold I'm dreaming of a place called home

[Pre-Hook: Wesley Stromberg]

[Hook: Wesley & Keaton Stromberg]

[Bridge: Keaton Stromberg]
If I could go back for the weekend
Or just for the day
To see familiar faces, that's all it would take
But it's too far

601,It's Too Late,"[Verse 1]
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing
Or maybe we just stopped trying

Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do

But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

603,Inside-Looking Out,"I'm sitting here lonely like a, a broken man
I serve my time doin' the, the best I can
Walls and bars they surround me
But, I don't want no sympathy

No baby, no baby
All I need is some tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burning oven
And, when my time is up, you'll be my reefer

Life gets worse on a God's green earth
Be my reefer, I got to keep smokin' that thing

Cause I feel good, yes, I feel good
It makes me feel alright
Feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright

Ice cold water runnin' through my veins, you know that
They try and drag me back to work again
Pain and blisters on my mind and hands
I work all day making up a, a nickel bag, nickel bags

The oats they're feeding me are driving me wild
I feel happy like a new born child

604,One More Heartache,"[Verse 1]
One more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it

One last straw was added, they say it broke the camel's back

Ah (ah) ah (ah)
I can't take it, I can't stand it

[Verse 2]
One more heartache, it would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high and then you let me down
Like the house you built from toothpicks stacked upon the kitchen table
One last toothpick tore it down; the foundation was not able

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, one more heartache would be too much load
I'm fed up with the heartaches; one more and I will explode

About the guy
Known as the cheater
He'll take your girl
And then he'll lie
And he'll mistreat her

It seems every day now
You hear people say now

Look out
For the cheater
Make way for the fool hearted clown
Look out
For the cheater
He's gonna build you up

And hurt you some more now

He's gonna build you up
Just to let you down

That cheater
Took my baby
Away from me, yes, and now
I don't mean maybe
I'll get her back
Just wait and see
Wait and see

One of these days he'll find a girl
Who knows all about him
She's gonna break his carefree heart
And go on without him

And you'll hear thereafter
Above all the laughter

Too bad
For the fool hearted clown
Tough break
For the cheater

607,Time,"[Time]

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up the dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then, one day, you find, ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Breathe Reprise]

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells",Pink Floyd,1966,"[50, 47, 50, 56, 73, 89, 91]",7

And I ain't over it yet

Rain, rain, rain, rain
Like to see my girl again
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Why'd you cause me so much pain

Rain, rain, rain, rain
My pillows soaking wet
You broke my heart
And caused me so much pain

Rain, rain, rain, rain
Like to see my girl again
Rain, rain, rain, rain
I wanna see you again

Please rain, come on, rain

619,The One On The Right Is On The Left,"There once was a musical troupe
A picking, singing folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered
To hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions
Keep them to yourself

Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted",Johnny Cash,1966,"[55, 46, 52, 58, 73, 83]",6

621,Wait A Minute,"[Verse 1]
Wait a minute
I think I left my conscience on your front doorstep, oh
Wait a minute
I think I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
But I'm here right now, right now
(Right now, right now)
Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow
I'm here right now, right now with you, oh wow, oh wow
(Right now, with you)
I don't even care
I’ll run my hands through your hair
You wanna run your fingers through mine
But my dreads too thick and that's alright

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute
Feel my heart's intention, oh
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages, do you really love me, baby
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said ""Oel ngati kameie""

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute (Oh)
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Some people like to live
Some just tryin' to get by
Some people I can't hurt
Some just rather say goodbye, bye

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

622,He Wore The Green Beret,"Once again...
Here we go...

[Verse One]
My soul is not for sale
Got a one track mind goin off the rail
As I, save the day what I mean to say
Ugly Duckling's on the way like a green beret
Uh-huh, no Grammys or platinum plaques
No chicks with fake noses or plastic racks
Just raps over tracks made of classic wax
Our past is the mic then I'll pass it back

Hey! What's happenin? You ready for action?
Hands get to clappin, the place is packed in
B-Boys backspin to DJ scratchin
The roof is on fire and I'm holdin the matches
Flows so cold it'll run to your nose
I'll stomp a mudhole and muddy your clothes
I'm harder than the hardest, hard as hard can get
Andy C heat it up like a bag of briquettes

Some cat gave us a bad review
Well I read what you said and I laughed at you
But that's cool, do what you have to do
We don't give a rat's ass if you clap or boo
We got bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Locked and loaded up with bang for the buck
Bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Right get on the cut and let's bang for the buck
Bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Locked and loaded up with bang for the buck

On your mark get set now I'm ready for rhymin
I'mma catch wreck like trains collidin
I stick to my guns like gum in the holster
And come high noon you'll get hung like a poster
I'm straight to the point like a bayonette
Mics melt in my hand like a Raisinete
I spit random words like I had Tourette's
You want bang for the buck? Place your bets

I got bang for the buck like a prostitute
In the group with the rep you cannot refute
As I move to the light I'm in hot pursuit
For success in my sight so I got to shoot
And it's - locked and loaded, hammer cocked exploded
Best not to hold it (hot) you get scolded (stop)
Then reload it, definitely
Cause on stage the mic's like a weapon to me

Einstein rocked the fat loop before he wore a tracksuit
Back in the day when Brother J had his black boots
{ahhhhhhh} I got lungs like a vacumn
And I'mma blow it up like your bathroom
I got bang for the buck, bang for the buck
You wanna knuckle up I got bang for the buck
Bang for the buck, bang for the buck

625,For Your Precious Love,"Your precious love
Means more to me
Than any love, than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you
I was so lonely, and so blue
That's what love, that's what love really made me do

And darling, oh they keep saying
That our love won't grow now
But honey I wanna tell them
And I just wanna show them
How in the world do they know that?

If only all, all night long
For as long as you've been in love with me now
I know our love will grow wider
And so deeper
Than any, any other seen

Of all the things I want now
In this whole wide world is just
For you to say, for you to say
That you will be my, my girl now
And I promise I won't leave you
I just keep wanting you all night, all night
I'm wanting you, nobody but you now, nobody but you now

628,My World Is Empty Without You,"(Intro)
My mind and soul
Have felt like this
Since love between us
No more exist

(Verse 1)
This my song to the most high, who created all life on earth
Like the birds that fly, the sweet air we breathe
All plants and trees, the sun, and every planet in the galaxy
Yo, they feeding us bullshit with all these books
We didn't ask to be here we got took
Enslaved, and killed, we was raped and hung
We was lied to, and forced to build America
Robbed of our technology, and knowledge of self
The Black man, is the original man of this earth
We can live under the sun, it give us strength
The White man gets sun burn, and cancer of the skin
I got a lot of white friends, I'm not a racist
I acknowledge the most high, I'm not an atheist
I just tell see through the bullshit, and speak my mind
They terrified of my words, so they censor my rhymes
Good lord, I'm crying out to you
Have mercy on the slave masters souls that did us dirty
They don't give a fuck about they own poor white trash
Just imagine how they feel about my black ass
Fuck Christopher Columbus, the Indians was here first
And fuck the Vatican, the pyramids is older
Shot off the nose and lips of our statues
Mad it was black faces, staring 'Back at you'
We even built pyramids on Mars, they won't tell us about that
Cause then we'd realize who we are
When I wrote 'Pearly Gates', they said I hated God
So I wrote this song the creator, the all

(Hook)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)

(Verse 2)
This my song for the Almighty, the first and the last
Your bloodline is alive and healthy
These people don't scare us
They call us niggers so much, we wear it
It's like a reminder don't forget it
It's no forgiving, the evils that got the whole world possessed
Under the spell, of the mighty green dollar bill
Got us running 'round shooting people up, beating people up
Sticking people up, selling people drugs
Genocide, suicide, homicide, murder
These are the things that we see being brought up
In cartoons, movies, and history books
We go outside, and it's the real Gunsmoke
Lil' niggas in the hood got car bomb burners, fifty-two shot banana clips
Lil' devil kids getting locked up for life, and do it on purpose
We fearless, and numb to the pain and the hurting... Lord!

629,Tears,"[Verse 1]
I tried hard to make you want me
But we're not supposed to be
And the truth will always haunt me
Even though it set me free
And my tears flow like the ocean
As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you

[Chorus]
Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

I'll, I'll, I'll get over you
I'll, I'll
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you

[Verse 2]
When did you lose your emotion?
When did you become so cruel?
And if you want to cut me open
Says a thousand words 'bout you
And in time I know you'll leave me
Like a distant memory
I know love can be so easy
If I start by loving me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt

Why do you wanna put me through the pain?

I can't hide away from the shame of you

I'll, I'll
I'll get over you
I don't need you to call me tonight

I don't need you to see if I'm alright
(I'll get over you)
You left me, so leave me, I'm fine
I'll be here getting on with my life

[Chorus]
Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
I'll get over you
Rain at my window, the pain washes out
I'll get over you, I'll get over you

632,Whenever She Holds You,"[Intro]

I see the world drowning in greed instead of killing off it's thieves
I see the people living in doubt, driving the cars that bring the drought
I see killers, terrorists, rapists, molesters, living from east to west, north to south
I see people so blind, focused on wealth, they can't see their destiny
I see the ones who tell the lies instead of simply telling the truth
I see the wrong envisions and feel nothing but the abuse
This world, our world, is dying inside, what happened to all it's youth?
I hope one day you can rise to liberation, my words can break the chains off of you

[Verse 1]
You sittin' down as second period starts to begin
You talking bad shit about some people, not even caring that there're your friends
But as class starts, the teacher smacks the ruler on his desk
You notice this new girl you really like
She's someone you want to impress
You instantly love her but know it's to soon to confess
She's someone you want to be with, no need to take a guess
When class has ended, you go over to her to try and ask her out
The words are put together in your head but not coming out your mouth
She know's what you were gonna say but then eventually walks off
Your filled with embarrassment and consumed in total doubt
But when school ends, you and her meet back up again
You were afraid that she would say ""No, I only want to be friends""
But she eventually says ""Yes""
Take a bow, grab her hand
You and her go out in your mama's van
You get filled with joy whenever she grabs hold of your hand
You grab her wrist, make a fist
Ask yourself ""How could life get any better than this?""

Do you remember?
Remember?

Do you remember?
Remember?

Remember? (ChiTown Ohhh)

[Verse 2]
One thing that she forgot to mention was what she was doing to you
She's been with your friend all along
You never got a clue
You didn't want to break it off, ya didn't like the thought of her gone
If you beat the shit out of him, then his parents are gonna sue
You want to stay together even though it is so wrong
But your friend is all up on her and there's nothing that you can do
So you sit back, listen to songs
Before you know he's right behind you
He finds out that your the other guy, hits your gut till you throw up your food
Both of you thought each other was ""the other guy""
Cause that girl could never pick and choose
You didn't think that it would happen but she breaks it off with you
You get so pissed, make a fist, punch the fan through the fucking roof
Next day at school, you get revenge, kick the shit out of him
Get suspended, and those two days feel like 2 weeks
Your friend calls you on the phone and says he wants to meet

[Verse 3]
On the outside you feel like this is the right thing to do
But on the inside you don't feel right but at the same time it's true
You don't want to be enemies forever so you decide to go through
You walk up to his house and stare it down from floor to roof
If a man is what you are, being one is what you have to prove
So you knock on the door, gaze through the windows
You watch as the door opens and later wishes that it was still closed
Two creeps in hoodies, guns in their hands, now your wishing you woulda stayed home
They throw you down on the ground punching you till you gotta cracked skull
They put bullets in your head, chest, knees, shoulders and ankles
You were such a good person, you didn't deserve to die
People say I'm wrong for defending you so why should I even try?
But in my eyes, you were real, never told a fucking lie
Mama in tears, and the only thing she ever feared was you losing your life
I know someday we'll meet again, but for right now it's ""goodbye""

[Hook]

[Outro]
I see the world drowning in greed instead of killing off it's thieves
Some want to see happiness and freedom, but all I see pain and nothing in between them
I know why you bought that gun, you want the bullet in your brain
But listen to my envision, I promise you I'm not insane
Remember my words, from this day because dying is not as bad as they say
Leave this world behind, ascend from the pain
And I will take you to a brighter day",Onemanband,1966,"[77, 64, 68, 75, 86]",5

Watching clouds through the skylight

There were flowers at the scene

Muted laughter from the kitchen
Muffled tears in the hall

Can’t admit to anything at all

There were postcards from the team
On the bandstand by the green
There were flowers at the scene

If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)

But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")
Because

And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)

And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?

Things were real bad for me
It was right after my accident
When I lost my hand

It seemed like I was all alone
With nobody to help me
You know, I almost gave up
All my hopes and dreams

But then, then, then something
Inside me kept telling me
Way down inside of me
Over and over again
To keep going on, yeah, on

Don't turn away
(You're gonna make it, baby)
Don't turn away
(Ah, try to make it, baby)
Don't turn away

Things are better for me now
Cause I found that I love music
So I learned to play the drums
And got myself a band and now
We're starting to make it

And if you can make it
At something you love
Wow, you got it all

So I'm saying this to all of you
All of you who think you'll never make it
All of you guys and girls
Cause you think you're so bad off

Or maybe you think you're
A little different or strange
So listen to me now
Cause I've lived through it all

Moulty

Don't turn away
(You gotta keep on trying)
Don't turn away
(Well, don't you give up, baby)
Don't turn away

Man I love my bitches
Man they photogenic
Snatched em straight up out they Richardson mag they do my dishes
Man I love this Cripping
Man my homies with it
All these murders they ain't got enough ambulances with ‘em
I ain't paying homage to nobody with no bodies
I don't care 'bout yo Ferrari I’ll snatch you out that Bentley
Was cramming into Civics 'round 2010ish
Piled in the studio when not a nigga would listen

[Chorus]
Now we're big time, big time, big time

Now we're big time, big time, big time
Hands up baby don't you see this big nine

[Verse 2]
Player shit player made
I’m stuck in my player ways
I just made a play today
She gave me some play today
My Jordan was layaway
I caught me a fade a day
Around where Janaya stay
My 40 go dumb in a major way
I come from the game where they pay to play
These rappers extorted like everyday
That Yankee I'm sporting like every day
Just played me a show they paid 80k
I put it away for a rainy day
You never know when you gon catch a case
You never know when you gon catch an opp
We kill ever day like where Sosa stay
You might get a pass

Big timer like Manny and Baby
Don't play with that man cause he crazy
With Demon and Ocho from Bompton
They stomping out niggas like Stacy
The radio never gon play me
I'll quit if my label don't pay me
I'll run up in there with my gun in the air screaming give me the shit you owe Jay Z
Bandana like Jayo from Daygo’s
My temper depend how my day go
My girl do whatever I say so
She ain't got no reason to say no
I ain't wish for nothing but hood rich
You ain't seen how grimey my hood get
I been on some up to no good shit
You on that Cuba from Boyz N da Hood shit
I go down to Cuba and find me a plug
Sick of these rappers not selling no drugs
Sick of this industry playing these games
Sick of my enemies saying my name

I’ll body a nigga for saying I can't

They tell me, ""Don't forget where you came from""
I regret what I came from
In my old hood moving like I got a vest on me
I'ma keep on winning, you should place your bets on me
I could open up a bakery, baguettes on me
Walking through the mall, I got a check on me
Designer look the best on me
I got lots of pressure, lotsa stress on me
Independent, I got people that depend on me
Knew you was a fake, you can't pretend on me
What I used to spend on you, I spend on me
Somehow all these problems keep on landing on me
I went on a mission with a bad bitch

All this money turned me to a savage
My life was better when I didn't have shit

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home
Driving by myself, ain't got nowhere to go

Couldn't buy one, now I got four, yah
Used to pray feds don't kick down the door, yah
Running back the sack the trap feel like a sport, yah
Yeah I'm famous but I miss my life before, yah
Finally got some money, can't go to the store
I lose every girl I love when I'm on tour
My mama calling me and I ignore
Running from my problems 'til my feet get sore

Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home

650,I See The Light,"I used to live my life in darkness
Just a slave in the Devil’s fortress
I used to live my life in doubt
Wondering what life’s about
Then one day a voice I heard
It said study the Bible and learn about the Word
And all the things I did see
And I never before believed in anything

Chorus:
I see the light
The Lord is giving
Oh, I see the light
I see the light
The Lord is giving
Oh, I see the light

I used to live from day to day
Wondering what the people say
I used to love the things I touched
And everything else didn’t mean much
But now I see the light
And I’m on my way
To a peace of mind that will always stay
You can have the same thing too
Just shine your light and He’ll see you through

665,Take Me For What I'm Worth,"Don't try and understand me, you never could do that
Ah, and in the end you'd wind up being hurt
I'm a man with too many problems that keep poundin' on my brain
So if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth, alright

I don't pretend to be a saint, my sins, they are many
But there's no one perfect in this universe
And though you think I'm weird, don't try and change me, dear
'Cause if you want me, you'll take me for what I'm worth

Hear a howlin' wind outside my door, there's restlessness within
Oh, I'm like a rain cloud that one day may burst
We both know I'll be leavin' and if one little tear you grieve
Ah, it's alright 'cause that's all I'm really worth

And if you think about me in your lonesome hours
Oh, and on your lips there's a sweet word and not a curse
Oh, then I'll be comin' back one day when my wanderin' is over
Oh, and if you want me, you'll take me for what I'm worth
Oh, and if you want me, you'll take me for what I'm worth",P.F. Sloan,1966,"[79, 76, 77, 77, 78, 91, 100]",7
666,I Confess,"Just out of spite
I confess I've ruined three lives
Now don't sleep so tight
Because I didn't care till I found out that one of them was mine

Night after night time time after time
Done too much of both types of w(h)ining
Still wasn't right fight after fight
Till ""Get out of my life get away from me get away from that gun""

Yes I could have phoned
I could have spoke
But how to break the news without beaking your heart
Being dead don't hurt
No only dieing

Sometimes it's right to say goodnight.""

Always searching for paradise
I'll admit that I'm good as blind
Darling I confess yes I've ruined three lives
And didn't care till I found out that one of them was mine

I confess
Our love seems like a punishment
And I confess
If it's all the same to you I'll stay indifferent

Don't pretend like you don't know why
Just a little word here a little push there Darling
I confess look I confess that I don't really care

I confess I confess I confess

Out like a light
Another boy who's given up trying
Blinded by fright
He scream my life's not open
Please get out

I like to shout

It's not a joke it's cards on the table time
It's not a joke it's cards on the table time

Make a girl just like you take a ride down town
Searchin' for a wedding gown
This golden ring's gonna bring a little tear to my baby's eyes
She's gonna be so happy and just like a woman she'll cry
She will smile and I know that no matter what the future may show
It's gonna be the two of us eternally

In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit

Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you be'll partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I

If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful hurt I feel inside

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Live through the loneliness
The endless emptiness
I go through

And when you lose a little sleep at night
Cause you ain't been treated right
Then you know heartaches are sad
Sitting by the telephone
Being left all alone
Then you know why I'm feeling bad
Put yourself in my place

And when you're just about to go insane
Cause it hurts to love in vain
Ask a girl who's been in love
I believed your evil line
Now I'm left alone and crying
Alone to count the stars above

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful emptiness
I feel inside
Put yourself in my place

Put yourself in my place

672,No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In),"[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
Came up, nigga, no elevators
Elevatin' haters with a pen and paper
Need to save up for some respirators
Cause these niggas hearts is filled up with hatin'
I'm the latest, but they run from Satan
Fuckin' slaves to paper but they never wake up
Demon faces powdered up with makeup
Only want the cake and I'm supposed to take her
Represent for the new age message, tryna give my generation some leverage
Been a member of the dark
Remember the fall of my soul? That's my November
Raise up into the light, it's only right that I lead the fight
I'm the sun up after the night, given insight to resurrect lives
Elixir sips, my nigga, take a hit
Your soul paper thin, my soul extra thick
I'm on my ancient shit, you can't pay for this
No genie in a bottle, but I get my wish, uh
Started from the bottom with no pot to piss
Now my generation love me and my conscious shit
Bull doze your prius, no stoppin' this
Weak niggas call it cocky, but it's confidence

[Verse 2: AK The Savior]
'Til the day I rest, I'm a beast like the Loch Ness
The best lowkey, that's me, young prophet
Spit bomb flows, torpedo drop
If your needle drop, better say I'm hot
How many motherfuckers wanna be at the top?
No effort, no triggers, nigga simple as that
Been through a lot so I fill a clip 'til stop
Tilt to the spot 'cause I been inhaling the pot
Silly motherfuckers think they runnin' shit
King-of-New-York talk, you're all soft pawns because your stomach's split
In the heap of battle, won't matter what sold platinum
Only thing that matters, your knowledge of war tactics
This is the Gaza, real dread locked roster
Execute a nigga talking shit in mi casa
Could of lost my life to the villainous monster
But my spirit just conquers everything I encounter
Motherfucker, hood is blown now each day
Now they burned out cause I earn from each race
Could of turned out on a jail route easy
But I stepped out the shade like a blunt, watch me blaze
UA the great, get your sin washed away
Tip top of shape, give me zip locks of dank
If you don't bake, nigga, pour up a drink
Live and have fun, nigga, come to your dreams

[Verse 3: Issa Gold]
Roll up a proper spliff, it's sittin' hot as shit
Dedicating every blunt to my prominence
Remain anonymous, unless it's commas to get
I was in a bottomless pit and now we float in the mist
Make the mist turn into monsoons
Pay the price and now we all colossal
Paint Picasso with a pencil, hostile
OG smoke engulfed in my nostrils
Make a toast, so what? We boast
We living lives, it don't take to know
We designed our hope, bet inside it sold
That's a rob in the coast like we riddin' a boat
Flatbush burnin' backwoods, attack coup
Bring a platoon to blast through you and your mans too
Bring it back up we masters better act cool
Turn the assholes and clap you and you damn fools

[Verse 4: AK The Savior]
Escape to a place of peace when the the drills blow
Happiness and love be the key to the real goal
Master in a game of life with no cheat codes
Told her no teeth and see she went beast mode
Hit her over stones at night and find my deep soul
Hit the bong, and long be gone alifinito
Incognito, hitter better reload
Everything you learn let it burn in the weed smoke
Inner light shinning like a diamond, hard to stick around
Enter in the game perfect timin' here to take you out
Here to make my momma proud, Livid when I knock em down
Spirit here to claim the crown AK be the golden child
Course they gon hate when they see you doin' great
Better start with yourself if you want to see change
Wanna see fame but don't even know the game
Try to restrain but I can't be changed
I ain't got shit for a dumb grown nigga
I'm speaking to the kids that alone don't give up
Ahead of your Biz young Lord don't deliver by the stars
Every inch go hard you a winner
Don't get lost in the matrix, minimum wages
Forced to the dark and be a criminal daily

Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it's settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Always at a place where the sun don't shine
The media wanna make me a bad guy
I don't know if I'm happy, you're right
I stay inside and I pray up to Christ
Hopin' one day I don't end my life
Way too depressed to express how I feel
Only smoke weed, sometimes on pills
Shit's a nightmare, I don't know what's real
She came back around since I got that deal
I don't want friends, I want happiness
She did me dirty, it's fuck that bitch
I was so broke but now I'm rich
Still the same gang, still the same clique
Xanarchy shit, tell that ho, ""Make a wish""
Feel the touch when we kiss
My hands on her hips, fell in love with her lips
Make her swallow my kids
The world is so evil while we lost in the mix
Tryna make it make sense
So I wanna know, does it matter to you
That I don't have no fucks to give? Bitch

Tear me from my mind

696,The Sound Of Silence,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might teach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence""",James Blake,1966,"[33, 25, 20, 12, 1, 2, 2, 1]",8
697,A Must To Avoid,"[Chorus]
She's a must to avoid
A complete impossibility
She's a must to avoid
Better take it from me

You'll think she's a prize at the start
But take my advice, play it smart
She's nothin' but trouble
Better cut out on the double
Before she gets into your heart

[Chorus]
When you stare into her pretty blue eyes
There's no way to see through her disguise
But don't try to love her 'cause you'll quickly discover
You're trapped in the web of her lies

[Chorus]
Her lips look inviting it's true
But lots of other guys have felt like you do
She'll build up your hopes and when you need her the most
That's when she'll say goodbye to you

Hey, hey, huh

Right here behind you, oh you trying to get it up, huh?

Let it be if we are nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no one between us

Dark Sun Riders, firmly handle this (3x)
Firmly handle this (2x)
Dark Sun Riders, firmly handle this (2x)

[Verse 1: Brother J.]
I am Chaos 'pon the verse
Interplanetary in the G's
With no cosmic refugees to get deep
Metamorphisizing funk
Cuz my level of my bass and my treble
Is strictly tied in, through Chaos
Adding to the Jam not the Jif
So come along wheat bread, we spread it on thick
Now some say demented, some say its sick
Say, ""Fighting for the justice is all politics""
But heal through my beak
I reach to the streets with the mountain-valley peaks
With more than merely techniques
To rhythm to phrase, cosmic rays keep me open
Never catch me choking, Solomon pulls deep
Deeper, deepest, Atlantis, The Basement
Straight from the core, I disintegrate the pavement
Volcanics, erupting blue-black
So take some mental notes as we double on-back
For some Godly data
No more goo-goo and no gaa-gaa
Brother turns dada
As we whip up new batters
Fresh off the lips like a cock was to hen
Prepare your mind, run tell your children

[Hook: Brother J.]
In the valleys of the seas, I can hear it in the breeze
(Dark Sun Riders, firmly handle this)
On Set for Sun, you know we merge for The One
As the (Dark Sun Riders, firmly handle this)
No matter what narrow path coming, if its wide open range
I release the energies I've mentally maintained
Evolution is the weapon and your my target
As the (Dark Sun Riders, firmly handle this)

[Verse 2: Brother J.]
Mmmm...Handle this, indeed no second guessing
I ride out the session like The God is possessed
I'm soaking the airwaves with untamed chaotics
My cerebellum reading's on blink, I feel The Zone
It's not the nickel-bag funk, son let's be easy
Don't rush me for no L's kid, those minds I make 'em weasy
I'm in the circle for purpose of my virtues
Primo energy, cipher does to wonders
As we build within the guild, Solo One
Keeps it dark and funky, Black-booting with The Suns
Of the fathers, one time for your mind
Enticing, strictly for refinement of your spine
This revelation will unlock and unravel
Prepare for travel, begin the ending
Focus presidents, non boble bent?
Never to refuse or deter the God sent
I throw my knotted rope for the knuckle-firm grip
To pull up the round for The Dark Sun flip

[Hook: Brother J.]
When I'm travelling the seas, I can hear it in the breeze

On Set for Sun, you know we merge for The One

[Verse 3: Brother J.]
It's the house of Eclipse, first wave attack
I can feel it in my bones, I can feel it in my back
It's the down-home rhythm, so you know we rise up
To do the right thing, it's time to give them what they want
As I storm in like fluids when the world's on fire
I e-void the heathen and straight praise The Eye-a
'Nuff principles as I vibe and I pull
Less chemicals keep my body vitals
No there's no bull as I keep my mind full
Quite flexible, so you know it's understood
This is dedicated to the ones who couldn't greet me
Called me devil, cuz I came in super freaky
Black boots, Black rings, my thing
The O, double D and the Dark Sun Swing
Yes, Roots Man from the center of the Earth
I represent the funk through birth quite enough
From verb to vibe, from dark to sun
And the freaky-deeky tongue of The God, Tahun
If the mortals don't get it and they don't seep in
Resurrect me with my mic, I'll go at it again

706,The Loop,"[Verse 1]
All my life I've been good
Do what my mom and dad and God say I should
Go to church and Bible School
To live by God's rule
So whatever people tell me
That The Bible tells me
I will do
Walk the halls of high school with my purity ring
Unlike those other girls, I've got my morals in check
It was easy to do until I got a boyfriend
And pardon my French, but he's cute as heck
But I made a pact to keep my hymen intact
And Jesus and I are tight
Never learned about the birds and the bees
I was taught to keep an aspirin in between my knees
'Cause The Bible says premarital sex is wrong
But Jason says that guys can't wait that long
I don't want to lose him to someone who'll do him
I need to figure something out
Well there's a loophole in The Scripture that works really well
So I can get him off without going to hell
It's my Hail Mary, full of grace
In Jesus' name we go to fifth base!
Oh, thank you for making me holy
And thank you for giving me holes to choose from
And since I'm not a godless whore
He'll have to come in the back door
Therefore

[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of a throbbing rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see

[Verse 2]
It's hard to be as pure as me
To resist the urge to lose my vaginal virginity
To wait until my marriage bed
To give my husband my unsullied maiden head
So take your cock out
Shove it in my ass
Fuck me until you cum
Oops! I mean let's join our souls
And unite our bodies
And fly with the wings of God
Whatever you do, don't touch my clitoris
If you ring Satan's doorbell, God can't ignore this
And no prophylactics when you put it in
'Cause birth control's for sluts and it's a sin
I've emptied my bowels
And laid out the towels
I'm ready for romance
Now I'm praying to the Power that's the Highest
But of all of my holes, this one's the driest
And we can't procreate if we anally copulate
And God is OK with sodomy, but only if you're straight
And I'm staying pure, no matter what
So I'm OK with everything but...
Everything but...
Everything butt

[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of a rock hard rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see

[Bridge]
I do whatever The Bible tells me to
Except for the parts that I choose to ignore
Because they're unrealistic and inconvenient
But the rest I live by for sure
So let's not talk about how the Good Book bans shellfish, polyester and divorce
And how it condones slavery and killing gays because those parts don't count, of course
Let's cherry-pick the part about losing my cherry and mine it for ambiguities and omissions
To circumvent any real sacrifice, but still feel pious in my arbitrary parroted positions
And don't you dare question my convictions
And don't look closely at the contradictions
Just focus on the sacrificial crucifixion
And have faith in its complete jurisdiction
As the only way to measure if you're good or not
And in a debate, just say to “have faith”
Because when you're up against logic, it's the only card you've got
So close your eyes
Take a deep breath
And...

[Chorus]
Fuck me in the ass 'cause I love Jesus
The good Lord would want it that way
Gimme that sweet sensation of an irrational rationalization
It's just between you and me
'Cause everyone knows it's the sex that God can't see

There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know

[Verse 1]
Vivid descriptions of showing off what's hidden in my mind
And I just think I could lose it at any given time
This that type of work you going crazy over if you let it
Take over, destroy, mix and mash up, don't forget it
I been through the good times and even through the bad
And I'm so glad I went through both so I could measure what I had
All the time spent, friends lost and those gained
I love the complex way of life, I never even chose plain
Damn, and you just tell me how the hoes came
I done heard some different stories, now it seems we both blamed
But I feel the most shamed, dealing with these situations
That are being handed to me causing all these complications
I just seem to cross the sections up until they make some sense to me
I'm living such a mystery, but It don't get to me
Dealing with my history I struggle with my past
And I always tend to ask myself how could this ever last
And I just wonder
Is there something that I'm missing now
Maybe it's not and I'm just missing out
Dont wanna waste the time that I got
So I'm just never gonna stop

[Hook]
There's something I want to tell you
There's something I want to tell you

[Verse 2]
Reliving memories, I swear this can't be real
But the vivid emotions that's mixed up in it make it feel
Like what's dormant is unsealed, I swear this is unreal
But the life I'm living now I think it's bound to get some killed
By that, I really think I'm meaning me
By losing me I find it possible that I could lose the beat
And lose my feet cause I'm just tripping on them
Giving up and slipping on them, pulling something different on them
Then I receive a vision from them
All the ones that made it, I'm talking about the greatest
Tell me keep up with my latest
Cause when push come to shoving and the time comes, I'll make it
And no I will not fake it, most cannot relate this
So instead they hate this, this what I created
With some paper pen and passion
People got they dreams but never put it all in action
So while they life is based on flashing
I'll be the only nigga to be where I imagined
And when they ask me how it happened
I'mma tell em
I stick to me and I ignore the lies
I see the truth and anger in they eyes
And nothing is the same, cause they bluff but it's a game
And I'm just tryna reach the fame

There's something I want to tell you
There's something I want to tell you

I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded
Girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Aww yeah, aww yeah, my sound is what up right now
I've been down, but I'm up right now

'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate, is it true?

You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business
But I just got one question, baby
Tell me why?

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Started from the bottom like Drake said
You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead
My squad'll  kick in your door where that safe at
No Atari, games girl I don't play that
If she broke I don’t acknowledge her, everything I say I follow up
What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin' on these hoes
Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us
Made a little money, still ain't got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open, don't say nothin'
Motor geeked up like a razor
You don't know me, you must mistake me
For somebody else
But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him
I had to tell her that

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what it was about you

I hear your laughter and there's something I've got to know
Are you there with another girl instead of me?

I'm standing on your doorstep and I don't know what to do
Should I ring your doorbell or just walk away?
My friends all say that you were never true
Hiding in the shadows

I see two silhouettes on the back of your window shade
Are you there with another girl when I am gone?
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made
If you're there with another girl, I can't go on

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So, if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, oh, I would surely die

Love requires faith, I've got a lot of faith, but
I hear the music coming out of your radio

I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye
So if there's another, I don't want to know
If you should go, oh, I would surely die

You would never leave me, hurt me or deceive me
I'm a fool to doubt you, worry so about you
Love requires faith, I've got a lot of faith, but
I hear the music coming out of your radio

Hmmm, yeah, I hear the music
Coming out of your radio

Strictly second hand
Everything from toothpicks
To a baby-grand

Stuff in our apartment
Came from father's store
Even clothes I'm wearing
Someone wore before

It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used

I'm wearing second hand hats
Second hand clothes
That's why they call me
Second hand Rose

Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar

Second hand pearls
I'm wearing second hand curls
I never get a single thing that's new

He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week

Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds

I'm not gonna fold or demise

Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas

I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan

Climbin' 100 mil in front of me

'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit

I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg

Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers

Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark

Through the work of the cross I'm justified
And made righteous inside a Holy God
But from a righteousness that is not our own
It's been imbued and included through Christ alone
In justification our works have no place at all
Just a ___? to the church to reverse the fall
Just an act of our God moment we believe

The God we praise is the God of nature!

The old familiar sting

Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else

He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can’t answer him back
I’m sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it’s to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

[Verse 2]
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning

You know what it is, we the QU pimps
Ask ya any shorties, we ran through their cribs
Up in them hills, down to the hills
Over in East LA
And take us to the jungle and we A OK

[Verse 4: Lamar Odom]
OK you take us to the jungle and we A OK
All I do is [bird sounds] and all the pain go away
I can say that, right, but I can’t tell you where I stay
It’s some place where they hate blacks
That’s why I stayin the room
Smoke a little tree and wash it down with a black
They’re saying [?] you’re fucking with… (Yo, check it)
How the fuck will I fuck with that and got a body like that
With a frame to match bitch
You could take a picture
All ya niggas [?] (go in, go in, go in, go in, go in, go in)
All ya niggas [?] (infrared [?], infrared)
You niggas need to read the scripture
Word to Allah, I'll send your ass to Yahweh
One way ticket and like Burger King you can have it your way

745,Rib Tip's (Part 1),"[Round 1: Franchise]
You my brother's keeper?
All that hype shit? This where I start slowin' ya roll
One week half prep for the main stage? This is how it'll go
See these bitches behind you start adlibbin', I'ma start liftin' the pole
Grippin' the chrome, the barrel spinnin' off jack (Jakk) like a rotary phone
Fuck a battle, I'll open-hand smack Jakk
Or a headshot, will make him backtrack
The coroner's got his noodles in the bag: we makin' Jack Mac!
Nigga fuck the Goonies, most of these niggas mad trash
I'll put some bags on ya head, that's mad stacks
I'll never fold, I'll pull a nigga's card - that's mad facts
Y'all get it?
Nigga I'll hit you and Ace, 2 in 1: I'mma black, Jakk! (Blackjack)
You my nigga, but I ain't playin' wit' bro
See, last time on the main stage, you ran off
This time, you ain't finna roll
I'm wavin' the fo'
And I got somethin' up sleeve {gun clicks} that'll put your Ace in the hole
Nigga I'm right at your door, I shot him once
He hit the pavement so I shot him some more
It's a Lakers game, Jakk (Jack) will get a permanent spot on the floor
I'm upset, I'm gunnin' for whoever up next
Dump TEC's
I'm hittin' Jakk (jack) on a late night like a drunk ex
I ain't play for real, we aim to kill, bang the steel
I couldn't wait to let these rounds off like trainin' wheels
You not ready, two hands on the bitch, I hold my Glock steady
Big-ass gun, and the clip stickin' out like Rex belly
I move shit, I told you we was trappin' wit' the tool grip
Dope boy, a smooth whip
Nigga, I used to flip drugs (Drugz) like Moon did
Nigga, we standin' tall
Big-ass gun and I air 'em all
You ain't heard what I said?
I'll swing on drugs (Drugz) like Barry Bonds!
How many times I tell you we live that life?
My nigga grip those pipes
Jakk, I have more grams on me than Bingo night
But you wanna know about my life?
Because I'm foreign, strapped up, can cross no borders
In a Bando, a bandit and the pack gorgeous
Nigga the trap phone ringin' longer than Zack Morris
But you bitches wanna get hype, you better tell them to grip
Have them strap in handy
Jakk, if they adlibbin', I'ma grip a Maggie
Yeah, as soon as they gas, I'll lean a ('Gasolina') nigga like Daddy Yankee!
I'll grip on a .9 in case ya man try to slide
It's Grand Theft Auto Jakk, stealin' (steel in) ya ride
I see death in ya eyes and you're a victim of mine
The toy came with a shell like a Kinder Surprise
You can't do shit for free, I lift and squeeze
Shotgun on me, try to jump me
I got the dump in my pants like Lil' Reese
See you be rattin', any minute
See they be chattin', you see the difference?
Catch the setup after like Jimmy Henchman
Nickel-plated, trigger finger, I'm penny-pinchin'
I'll body any day with the slickest rhythm
Ya niggas trippin' I'll grip a Smith n'
Or put a band on ya head like Jimi Hendrix
This a body, in the gym duffle
Clip touch you
Big buckle, big ratchet
Sig' clappin'; Ms. Hustle
Y'all niggas a bunch of instigators
Fuck a favor
Drive-by, window down, I'm tryin' to check a hater
Silencer on it, I'll grip 'em later
All you'll hear is {click click click click click}
Sound like I left on my indicator
You know my slogan

[Round 1: Jakkboy Maine]
I said, y'all wanna know what I don't understand?
Is how my blow up at N.O.M.E. 9 left Smack wit' his hands tied
And between stock and positionin', where he should land mine
See for awhile, John seen a (Cena) way around the wolf like a campfire
But after The Rock showed, Smack gave me the option to start my own Franchise
It's the bad guy, and it's beef hoe
With the hot stove or the pot roast
Or Chipotle with the bowl
The brown rice and the tacos
Pussy I want the veggies, the hot sauce, the sour cream, extra cheese
And if you don't, I click and squeeze and every bullet gonna be pinta beans
Fuck is you mean?
My junior say ""ow"" (Junior Seau) for this inner concussion
His ashes? Chuck 'em
I won't leave behind a part of Franchise, not for my kids or nothin'
I go fo' for fo', super size, but that soul food be bustin'
So for revenge I'm hungry, and at this franchise all I serve was chicken and dumplings
He runnin' and fumblin'
He gonna get this, my nina in France with a French kiss I go fish sticks
And ya soul fool
Cause at this franchise we make rib tips, the gripless, equip clip
The shit click
Oh shit quick
The baby had an appointment around 9:00
Fuck, so I had to switch shifts
But whoa now, the semi wit' me
Super charged, hemi wit' me

{chokes}

[Round 2: Franchise]
The Goonies, look like they like sparrin' my G
And everytime shit goes down, I fuck wit' y'all so I jump in if he start askin' of me
But one incident, y'all wanna roast Gotti cause it look like he ducked from the scene?
Nigga, it's FT Double Mafia, one more word about Geech' we gon' start sparkin' for free
BAOW, neck shot, I bet you the apple won't end up far from the tree
Y'all believe in Jakkboy Maine?
I'll pop up where Jakkboy stay wit' a big ass shot
{Gun cocks} All up in Jakkboy face
He ate the bullets, I'm tryin' to fight the charges, they ain't lookin' all that strange
Ain't it ironic, how he kept the shell but I'm the one tryin' to fight that case?
Let's stop the banter
Why is you a [?] when I can slash ya master, grab a dagger
Carve your face in 'til Jakk a lantern (jack-o-lantern)
You couldn't mirror me, I let it ring
Silencer on the pistol, sound like Mr. Bean
Pistol whip, he missin' teeth
Sticks wavin'; symphony
Chest shot, off his tee like little league
You should've stayed home, this a body, case closed
Big knife, Maine froze
One swipe, lay low
I'll leave a quarter in Jakk (jack) like it's a pay phone
You lackin' heart, the chrome'll spark
So many guns, I got a Taurus, a Desert Eagle and a bull dog
Yeah, a pair these like Noah's Ark
I'm at your mans, strap under waist like a fanny pack
I clap a gat, big scope, watchin' the kid like a nanny cam'
Face shot, I'll put your grill in your plate like a traffic jam
Dome shot, now y'all can share Jakk (jack) like a family plan
I got a nigga doin' a life sentence, for the pipe grippin'
For you? I'm ice pickin'
Knife bendin', and I'll fuck Twork (twerk) up like white bitches
You a lame fam', straight wack
You get the butterfly or a gem star like a game tag
Then I switch the tone on you bitches; spray tans
.8 blam
Put a black piece to your mug like a Bane mask
Take that, steel around; cage match
Head first; face plant
I'll spray cans, leave a Monstar sinkin' in Jersey like in Space Jam
Bitch, do you know who you fuckin' wit'?
I'm dumpin' shit
There'll be no face in the casket when I up a clip
Your family lookin' in the box like they don't know who son is this
And ya mama lookin' at the body like Tay Roc wit' the chain
""What the fuck is this?!""
I'll show you how to use a shot [?]
We was doe boys, I can teach you lesson 1 on 1 on how to use the pot
You should've Drugz, Jakk (Jack) I was gon' Black and this my School Of Rock
You blood? I grip a lotta
You blood? I lift a choppa
Leg shot
Blood? It'll drip on the kicks; Balenciagas
I already killed a Goonie, ya man got wacked
So tell these lil' niggas I ain't playin' Jakk
Glueazy wanna get hype and a white boy wanna scream in my face? I'll grab a MAC
That's a fact
Pistol whip, to the white meat, now you can look like that Cracker Jack (Jakk)
Nigga this shit is mine, you my brother, but the facts don't ever lie
The last main stage, John John had you lookin' petrified
How the fuck did you get bodied? I thought Goonies don't ever die
This shit is mine
I'll lift a .9, see my weapons, they'll ride
See my Goonies? They alive
I'll hit Jakk (jack) from long distance like ""Charges may apply""
You know my slogan I'm 'bout action
Chrome clappin', no lackin'

[Round 2: Jakkboy Maine]
Aye, I got a question
Now do y'all know what Franchise is?
Like no, really, really it just really hit me
You ain't a founder but a beneficiary
I'm a visionary, it get really scary
Vision blurry, hair ain't sittin' curly
Man his own country did him filthy
Cause before the Rockets, Franchise was draftin' and traded by the Vancouver Grizzlys
You gotta feel me
Cause I'm sick of the games and the damn lies
A.I. get crossed by Franchise he be holdin' his damn side
Smack dead, nobody know what really happened and all of the fans fried
But man why?
When that's what usually happens to the owner of a franchise
Cans fly, and you ain't the king of Banned in ya damnest mind
We spin, this nigga ain't hard to find
We spin again, turnin' back the hands of time
We drown him, cause first it was KOTD, Beast Mode now URL is ya guys?
That ain't no damn surprise
When a Franchise goin' under he always change the name and signs
Cannons fly and I'ma stand on mine
Is ya hands on God?
Cause if he don't duck he get this bomb if it Land Before Time

{Chokes}

[Round 3: Franchise]
Nigga, I don't give a fuck what no one says
I like that chain
This bitch wack, that's big facts
See I load the clip if I miss, empty it 'til the click clack
Listen what I said, I load the clip if I miss, empty it 'til the click clack
Y'all still might not get it
Reloadin' wit' the Calicoe
In case Murda ain't go down the first time like Summer Impact
I show ya how the cannon'll work, I'll handle him first
Then put ya man in the dirt
Kidnapped, then everybody get the same text it's an Amber Alert
We shootin' everything, even the witness

{Crowd starts chanting 3-0}

We shootin' everything, even the witness cause the op might sing
You know, the Drako (Drake go) hittin' Jakk (Jack) like 'Hotline Bling'
Don't be surprised, if I hit them, they ain't friends of mine
I'll lift a .9, if I dump a slug I run inside
If I clutch a pump, you better duck and hide
Chess shot, the docs screamin' ""Hold on Jakk (jack)!"" like someone's on the other line
I got some shit to ask you first
How the fuck you get bodied by John John he ain't have a third?
How the fuck do you jump into the crowd, run off the stage, forget your chain and forget your shirt?
The shit absurd
Niggas was rockin' ya shit in the crowd like you was sellin' merch
These niggas ain't no ridas
I know some hitmans that'll air it by ya
I told y'all I was in the trap, not for days, months
Stirrin' (steering) the white like Baby Driver
I don't fuck wit' him
My brother just got deported for shavin' onions and touchin' bricks
Yeah, a rise in a Bird like Above The Rim
Man you late, I'll mask up, blackin' (Blac'in); Jagged Jay
I grab a K, bullet in him, he shakin', park in son (Parkinson); Cassius Clay
I'll pick from both sides, let the class debate, I'll slash your face
I'll lacerate your back and legs 'til the doctors puttin' pieces of Jakk back together with masking tape
And his mama walkin' in circles tryin' to identify him by a tag like baggage
I'll torch your face

{Crowd starts chanting 3-0}

You gave Twork 59 hours? This nerds a fake
You give me 59 hours, pussy, you won't make it past the first 48!
I don't fuck witchu, I'll buck a few
Whip you wit' the handle like Uncle Drew
They gon' know you dead, I'll hold the lead
And y'all can catch everything cause a water shot is the only thing overhead
The Low Life Thug? I ain't even condoning that
The Low Life Thug? Tell me how you want me to react
The Low Life Thug? 'Til I'm loadin' the gat
Baow, six feet deep
Now let me know if you want shit to get lower than that
You know my slogan, I'm 'bout action, the chrome clappin'
Two words
(No lackin'!)

[Round 3: Jakkboy Maine]
I said Franchise, I heard you was the guy in Toronto
Fly in the spot though, spot yo' Murcielago
Maple Leafs, defined as frontos
Surprised though, Glock hoe
And what I had on there rose and left after the ring he Kawhi in Toronto
But today's the day

{Jakkboy starts talking to the crowd}
Y'all gonna let me rap? I'm tryin' to give y'all the show. Y'all gonna let me rap? I fucked up. I know it, let me rap. You feel me? You feel me? You feel me? Let me rap. Let me give y'all somethin', shit. You can fuck up your own shit. I'm gonna try to beat up one of you niggas again

Sit alone by the phone, a phone that never rings
Hoping to hear you say, you love me still
Knowing you never will

Love, love, love has made a fool of me
Got me doing things, things that shouldn't be
Listening for the sound of your knock on my door
Knowing that sweet sound will be no more

Funny, how precious memories linger on
So long after you're gone
And oh, precious memories that only make me cry
But I keep holding on, oh, why do I?

All because love, love, love makes me do these things
Speak your name softly each night
While holding your picture tight
When you took my heart, you took my soul
And it's far beyond control

Funny how precious memories linger on
So long, after you've gone
Oh, precious memories that only make me cry
But I keep holding on, oh, why do I?

All because love, love, love makes me do these things
Speak your name softly each night
While holding your picture tight",Martha Reeves & The Vandellas,1966,"[70, 80, 86, 87]",4

It's pulling me further away
My family's breaking and I'm giving myself all the blame

How do you explain that you've been so low?
You'd steal just to keep your stomach full and your habits up

Alone, afraid to move an inch on a binge

758,Giddyup Go,"Cause I told 'em about that little boy of mine
And how his first word about that old truck was Giddyup Go
Well today I was barrelin' down old 66
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me
A big ole lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cough
A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddyup Go
Well I pushed old Giddyup Go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup Go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen
And I lost all track of pop cause mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup Go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on the old 66
And he's handled that big rig
Better than any gearjammer that I'd ever seen
Well sir now the lines on the highway have got much brighter glow
As we go roarin' down the road
And me starin' at a little sign that reads Giddyup Go",Ferlin Husky,1966,"[85, 82, 94]",3

761,Spanish Harlem,"[Verse 1]
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street
Right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

[Verse 2]
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal
That looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon
I'm going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in my garden

I'm going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in my garden

762,Where The Sun Has Never Shone,"[Verse 1]
Round like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending nor beginning
On an ever spinning reel

Like a snowball down a mountain
Or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning
Running rings around the moon

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

[Verse 2]
Like a tunnel you can follow
To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone

Like a door that keeps revolving
In a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble
Someone tosses in a stream

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

[Verse 3]
Keys that jingle in your pocket
Words that jangle in your head
Why did Summer go so quickly
Was it something that you said?

Lovers walk along a shore
And leave their footprints in the sand
Was the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?

Pictures hanging in a hallway
Or the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces
But to whom do they belong?

When you knew that it was over
Were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the colour of her hair

[Conclusion]
A circle in a spiral
A wheel within a wheel
Never ending nor beginning
On an ever-spinning reel

As the images unwind
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind",Noel Harrison,1966,"[97, 100]",2

And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 3]
So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can’t hear you anymore
I’m a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 4]
So long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don’t mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don’t think twice, it’s all right",Bob Dylan,1966,"[36, 27, 17]",3

Don't let this

Though she begged me to stay
I was sure I was right

And hearing my mama say

(Hush, little baby, don't you cry)
(Mama won't go away)
Mama!!!

Mama!!!
I can never go home anymore

775,Don't Look Back,"[Verse 1]
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

[Verse 2]
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

Lose, lose conversations
I'm 'bout to lose patience
Said this in the basement
I can't front now
It's takin' everything in me not to say shit
So much fake shit ever since I made it
I won't ever be quiet cause I'm famous
Y'all gon' hate this (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
This ain't no average Joe shit, this is everyday Russell
Joe got a day job, that's an everyday struggle
This for all the slow rappers who subliminally diss
You can at it, you can text it but you'd rather be bitch
But it's hard to hear the hate over these waves crashing
I think your time is up, I think your waves crashing
All that fade catching you promoting shit is all talk
The difference is my life is still lit when I log off, pussy go head

Lose, lose conversations
I'm 'bout to lose patience
Said this in the basement
I can't front now
It's takin' everything in me not to say shit
So much fake shit ever since I made it
I won't ever be quiet cause I'm famous
Y'all gon' hate this (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Fuck these fake alliances
I don't be buying shit, it's not in my interest
You be window shopping, I be buying it
I'm fly as shit
Just keep in mind what position you in
If you lucky I might make a song and diss you again
And when I say you, I meant you too
They call me Bono
Rappers sending subtweets, rappers stealing logos
Rappers feeling jumpy
Then bounce pussy, pogo
This gon' get a billion streams
This for the rappers who need promo
This for rappers who need other rappers hooks to go bronze
This for rappers who need other rappers shows to go on
(Go off)
These for rappers who still suck still
Six years later you still stuck still
Still on the uphill
There's some rappers who won't be here by the next June
There's some rappers who still asking for some leg room
I just give em half a bar like they give themselves
I kick back and watch these losers go and kill themselves

[Chorus]
Lose, lose conversations
I'm 'bout to lose patience
Said this in the basement
I can't front now
It's takin' everything in me not to say shit

780,Apple Of My Eye,"[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
The other day seen this girl walk by the other way
I would have spoke but when I looked at her she looked the other way
Had it been another day I would have grabbed her by the hand
You don’t know who I am but see I love the way you smile
Do you got a man I’d be honored if I can walk with you for a second
That's if you ain’t got no plans
I’m trying to get to know you cause you’re the type I go to
The type I write a song and make a beat about and flow to
Anything to show you how beautiful you are
Wish I could hold you at night and every morning say hello to you
But you don’t know it yet
Maybe I’ll approach you next time and let you know exactly how I feel about you
Until then I think of how fly it would be if it were her and I
The apple of my urban eye
And next time no lie I guess I’ll try cause I

[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
It was one week later when I peeped her at the bus stop
Laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
Caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
Knowing I should go and talk to her fuck it why not
I walked over but I still couldn’t do it
It was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
See fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
And I’m never out of dodge when cupid aims with his pistol
They leave wounds and they scab and they pus
Just when I was thinking that I look up and seen the bus
Come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
That’s when I could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
I put my eighty-five cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
And I was extra sure until somebody sat first
Damn I guess my story got to wait until next verse

[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
It was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of July
But she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
So this my opportunity to try and get at her
""Is it cool if I sit?"" and then a smile was her reply
I sat down and started talking to her
Be careful of what I say cause I ain’t want to sound awkward to her
Said I been peeping you but I ain’t never spoke
And I figured if I try I probably choke
Then she laughed and looked at me acting like I told a joke
And said ""Joke for what? Lighten up, real talk I been trying""
And plus I always see you with him and she laughed again
But what she said next took me for a spin

[Bridge: Erika Flowers]
I saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
Waiting for a shooting star every night of everyday
To wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
Forbidden juices had me so weak

[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye

I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you

781,Princess In Rags,"There's a girl who lives down the track
In a little shack made of timber wood
And her clothes are all hand-me-downs
From the folks in town who treat her so good

Though she hasn't got a dime
I'm so proud that she's all mine
'cause to me she's a princess in rags

Now her dad, he's a worn-out man
Prayin' if he can make enough to eat
And her mom cleans for everyone
Till the day is done just to make ends meet

All her wealth is in her charms
And the sweetness of her arms
How I love my poor princess in rags

I know some day I'll find a way
To take her out of this old place
I'll work and slave, scrimp and save
To change her rags to silk and lace

Though it hurts and my body aches
From the pain it takes just to set things right
But for now I must be content
With each moment spent in her arms each night

She's the only girl for me
And some day it's gotta be
Just me and my princess in rags

She's the only girl for me
And some day it's gotta be
Just me and my princess in rags",Gene Pitney,1966,"[63, 46]",2

You are an impostor, ain't got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly

Love wearin' all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I'm feelin' Godly
Hop out like Coke, I ain't gotta park it
Fuck is y'all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can't get 'em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won't stop callin'
IBGM be the clique, bitch, you see us scorin'
V.I.P in the plural, while yo section borin'

Mind full of money, got a heart full of demons

Buried in the past, so many moments I want back
Tomorrow doesn't hurt until yesterday

Don't fight it, don't fight it

I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true

And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat

You came into my life without a warning
And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every morning
Yes you are my every dream come true

See me sadness, when me laugh
When me quiet, hear me work
Feel me love and want me bitch
Pull me switch, drag me over
Know me hard when me soft
Know me scared when me talk tough
Go get them guts
Go get them guts
Cut, then cut up your sleeve!
All is useless, it's not real
Feel it all this stress
And give you all emotion or nothing
Explosive expulsion of a bye bye
Say bye-bye!
Expose your emotion over my
And say bye-bye!

All or nothing
Everything or nah

Ey!
Woman chase me need a man
Love me like you hate me man
Me, I am the Elliphant
Waking up the sleepy land
Move me hard, move me soft
Know me scared when me talk the tough
Unlock the man's head, unlock the man's
Unlock the man's up your head
Words are enough to say
Feelings have no song or flesh
It's a whisper from the red
Say want me fall down, me rise up, up, up, up
Say want me clear, love me good!

Huh!

Step into everything relevant
Don't care if you malevolent
Or you may never land
Well it is clear and evident
We roll in like the president
Look pon the whole street
Then see for the resident
And given them democracy
Axes sharp make sure that thing is permanent
Have to get what I have to get
Me don't care if it is hard to get
I come take and then calculate
Then do something immaculate
Look pon de wall
Check pon de right
Listen to tonda
Look at the light

786,Seesaw,"It was a good start
The ups and downs, themselves
Before I knew it, we grew tired
With meaningless emotional drains

Repeated seesaw game
Now, I'm so sick of this
Repeated seesaw game
We're getting sick and tired of each other

Were the petty arguments the start?
The moment I became heavier than you
Because there have never been parallels in the first place
Maybe it was my greed trying to match myself with you
If it was love, and if this is what love means
Is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
We're tired of each other, yet seem to be holding the same cards
Well, then

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get off of it
There's no turning back

Let's not measure who will get off first
Let’s not drag things out
Let's follow our hearts
Let's put an end to this
This repeated seesaw game
Let's end this now

People can be so crafty
We know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
But because we don't want to be the villains
In the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
We became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
Although this wasn't the kind of parallel that I wanted

At first, we showed off who was heavier
We bragged and smiled at each other
Now we're trying measure who's heavier
A competition between us
That became a flame, igniting quarrels
It’ll only end if someone gets off right here
Acting like we’re comforting each other
With words mixed with thorns
Can’t keep doing this, we need to make a decision

If we didn’t have feelings for each other
If we didn’t think of each other
Would we have dragged it out like this?
Now if you don’t have any more feelings
This seesaw is dangerous
Stop thinking about me

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get off of it
There's no turning back

(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) Just like the beginning when you weren't here
(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) I'm getting off this seesaw without you

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get off of it
There's no turning back

Let's not measure who will get off first
Let’s not drag things out
Let's follow our hearts
Let's put an end to this
This repeated seesaw game
Let's end this now

(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) Just like the beginning when you weren't here
(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) I'm getting off this seesaw without you",Genius English Translations,1966,"[78, 53]",2
787,Follow Your Heart,"[BOBBY, spoken]
Did you mean what you said? About everyone having a heart?

[HOPE, spoken]
Well, sure I did. Do you think you'd be feeling as bad as you do if you didn't have a heart?

[BOBBY, spoken]
I don't know. I suppose not. 

[HOPE, spoken]
Of course you wouldn't. Because then you'd be dead. 
(sung)
When darkness surrounds you and you lose your way
You have your own compass that turns night to day
And it's even with you before you depart
Be still, hear it beating
It's leading you
Follow your heart

[BOBBY, spoken]
Follow my heart. But to where?

[HOPE, spoken]
To wherever your heart tells you to go. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
Even there?

[HOPE, spoken]
Even to the clouds, if that's what your heart commands. What's it saying now?

[BOBBY, spoken]
I don't know. I don't know how to listen to my heart. 

[HOPE, spoken]
You have to listen carefully. Here, let me try. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
Do you -

[HOPE, spoken]
Shh! Ah, there it is. It's saying:
(sung)
We all want a world filled with peace and with joy
With plenty of water for each girl and boy
That bright, shining world is just waiting to start
No meanness or sorrow, just cleanness tomorrow
If only you follow your heart
(spoken)
You see there, Bobby? Even your heart knows you should follow your heart. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
Peace and joy? Plenty of water? I guess I do want those things. 

[HOPE, spoken]
There's something else your heart was saying. Maybe something I shouldn't have heard. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
There was?

[HOPE, spoken]
I think so. It was barely audible but I definitely heard something. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
Well? What was it?

[HOPE, spoken]
Let me try again, maybe I can make it out this time. There it is. So faint. It's saying:
(sung)
Follow, into the open air
Far from squalor and noise
Follow, someone is waiting there
Someone who shares all your hopes and your joys
(spoken)
Someone is waiting there? Why, my heart was saying those exact words just the other day. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
It-it was?

[HOPE, spoken]
Sure it was. Squalor and noise, hopes and joys. It was telling me about all those things. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
I didn't know two hearts could speak as one. 

[HOPE, spoken]
I didn't either, until now. Here, listen. 

[BOBBY]
Someday I'll meet someone whose heart joins with mine
Aortas and arteries all intertwined
They'll beat so much stronger than they could apart
Eight chambers of muscle to hustle the love in our heart

[BOBBY & HOPE]
Love is kind and considerate
Love is peaceful and fair
Love can creep up so suddenly
When you least think of it, your love is there

We all want a world filled with peace and with joy
With plenty of justice for each girl and boy
That bright shining world is just waiting to start
No anger or badness, just laughter and gladness
If only I follow your heart",Mark Hollmann,1966,"[92, 96]",2
788,Black Nights,"[Verse 1]
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Verse 2]
Still through the haze I can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 2]
I've played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Chorus 3]
I've walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Outro]
So walk with me as the sweet wind dances
I'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights",Taylor Swift,1966,"[93, 91]",2
789,I Hear A Symphony,"You've given me a true love
And every day I thank you, love
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting, so exciting

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly (I hear a symphony)
Ooh, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
Till I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Play sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, now, baby, baby, baby
You bring much joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on, now, baby, baby, baby
Those tears that fill my eyes
I cry not for myself
But for those who've never felt the joy we felt (baby)

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love now, baby, baby
As you stand holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now, baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Ooh, so close to me, baby, baby, baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody",The Supremes,1966,[30],1
790,I Will,"[Intro: Eminem]
And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)
I do my best to try to block it (Redrum)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9""]
I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four-inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start taking off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Ferrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, I bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beatboxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shottas
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
Manslaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Ayy, bruh, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
Them niggas that'll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me ""The Enemy Watcher""
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
All your bars subpar like good golfers
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (Pew)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, ""Motherfuck school,"" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, ""What the heck was that?""
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, but you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image, I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic
Newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So, Lord, forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

[Outro: Eminem]
And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)
I do my best to try to block it (Redrum)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)",Eminem,1966,[32],1
791,I'm A Man,"[Produced by Kevin Parker]

[Verse 1]
Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fucking doubt I make, unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to (uh)",Tame Impala,1966,[35],1
792,Let's Get Together,"Let's get together, yay-yay-yay
Why don't you and I combi-ine
Let's get together, what do you say

Why don't we ma-a-ake a scene
Together, oh oh oh oh

Lets get together, yay-yay-yay
Think of all that we could sha-are
Lets get together everyday

Darling, let me have another day
And I can be anything that you want me to be, now

Sometimes you used to say them to me

Ooh, I want another day
You can let me have just one more day
Ooh, I need one more day, yeah
And I will do anything that you want me to do

I will do anything that you want me to do, now
Say anything that you want me to say
Buy you anything you want me to buy
And I can cherish you till the day I die

If you let me have another day
Please let me have one more day
Ooh, I want just one more day, lord
And it can be anything that you want me to be

Just one more day now
You can let me have just another day, now
Please I want to stay and the day after and the day after

Said I'm lost in my mind

Just gimme a lil time
To get my mind right
And get back on my grind

In the back on my mind
Is the back of your head
Hidden in the back yard
For the shit that u said

Ya way back then
You lames shoulda learned
That the games a bitch
And u get what u deserve

Shouldn't of slept on me
Cuz now u sleeping for good
Now I'm sleeping by beach
And u wishin u could

But shots goin off
Cuz its storming in my head
I wonder where i am
I wonder what i said

I wonder what i did
Is this jus a dream
Am i fuckin dead
Cuz id die for the green

Id die for my team
Cuz i ride wit my team
And if i gotta pick one
Imma side wit my team

We ain't all right
We ain't all right
Our future not bright

If we don't use our eyes
Or if we don't take advice
And learn from the wise
They'll keep feeding lies

So we gotta recognize
What this implies
That we gotta come together
And fight for our side

Fight for our rights
Fight for the light
For sight of the signs
Then we be aight

Imma fight all night
And this might get me killed
But its nice to know
That i did what i could

Cuz i said that i would
And we'd would be all good

That my intentions were good

Is when u hear me rhyme",CFLYNNA,1966,[94],1

And go back to

Before you've got lay it down?
It's the last leg, the last stretch of road
That will lead you back around

What does it mean that you can't give enough?
Well, you take it down a level and there we go

797,Look In My Eyes,"[Chorus]
Traumatized
You can see the pain when you look in my eyes
Butterflies
Inside my stomach but they probably died
It's my time to bloom
But all my emotions and happenings lead me to doom
Don’t know what to do
Just wish I could live in the moments that I spent with you

[Verse 1]
Leave me out
In the cold and sleet
Now my heart is froze
And it's hard to breathe
I don't wanna live
I don’t wanna be
In so much pain and so much grief
Hold me back when I'm on the edge
When I wish it was me and not you that was dead
All regret
And I'm so upset
Lookin' at all your messages I left on read
Cut me up
Throw me in the trash
I won't fit in a coffin or a body bag
Times are good and then they jump to bad
So I live in the bestest of moments we had (One, two)

[Bridge]
Wish we could make one more song
I'll be there, bro, it won't be long
Imma do what you'd want me to do, rip my bong
And you’d probably say ""Giz, stay strong""

Traumatized
You can see the pain when you look in my eyes
Butterflies
Inside my stomach but they probably died
It’s my time to bloom
But all my emotions and happenings lead me to doom

Traumatized
You can see the pain when you look in my eyes

(Downbeat, Denny. Denny. Downbeat!)
(What?)
(Get out of here!)
(Oh, man!)
(Oh, rock out!)

[Verse]
Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops falling down the mountainside
Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were in love
High on a mountain of love
Night after night I'm a-standing here alone
Weeping out my heart till the cold grey dawn
Praying that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
(Oh yeah!)
Trying hard to find you somewhere up above
High on a mountain of love

[Pre-Chorus]
The mountain of love, the mountain of love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

[Chorus]
Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should've been ours
That's why I'm so handy, my dream is gone above
High on a mountain of love

(Keep playing it like it is!)

High on a mountain of love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should've been ours
That's why I'm so handy, my dream is gone above
High on a mountain of love[x4]

[Outro]
(What, honey?)
High on a mountain of love
(Hahahaha)
Ooh baby...
(That's good.)
One more time. Oooh baby. Ooo
(That's a good voice)",The Beach Boys,1966,[100],1
