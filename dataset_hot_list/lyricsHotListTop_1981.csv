1,Waiting For A Girl Like You,"[Verse 1]
So long, I've been looking too hard, I've waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know what I will find
I only know it's a matter of time
When you love someone
When you love someone
It feels so right, so warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I want to be sure

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
A love that will survive
I've been waiting for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life

[Verse 2]
You're so good
When we make love it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone
Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's no where on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you, tenderly

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
A love that will survive

4,Young Turks,"[Verse 1]
Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket
And a head full of dreams
He said somehow, someway
It's gotta get better than this

Patti packed her bags
Left a note for her mama
She was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes
When she kissed her little sister goodbye

They held each other tight
As they drove on through the night
They were so excited
We got just one shot of life
Let's take it while we're still not afraid

Because life is so brief
And time is a thief, when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand
It can slip right through your hands

[Chorus]
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let them put you down
Don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

[Verse 2]
Paradise was closed
So they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
They took a tworoom apartment
That was jumping every night of the week

Happiness was found in each other's arms
As expected, yeah
Billy pierced his ears
Drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh!

[Chorus]
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let them put you down

Billy wrote a letter back home
To Patti's parents tryin' to explain
He said: 'We're both real sorry
That it had to turn out this way'

But there ain't no point in talking
When there's nobody listening
So we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a ten-pound baby boy, yeah!

[Chorus]
Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight, time in on your side

Young hearts gotta run free
Be free, live free

7,Leather And Lace,"(with Elizabeth Cook)
I love so fragile
And the heart so hollow
Shatter with words
Impossible to follow
Youre saying Im fragile
I try not to be
I search only
For something
I cant see
I have my own life
And I am stronger
Than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you wont be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you wont be walking out the door
Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace
You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew Id never want to leave
Sometimes Im a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you light my nights
Somehow Id get by
Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace
Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me

Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues

[Verse 1]
Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say ""Live fast, die young,"" so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard ""Can't Get Enough""
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, ""The Things Hoes Say""
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble

And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like ""Don't you know this shit already?""
""Nigga, ain't you rich already?""
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho

""Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?""

And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take you car, Yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yea, I guess I gotta buy it!

Yesterday's songs
Don't stay around long
Not much anymore

But the truth always stays the same
And the good things will never change

Just sayin' ""I love you""

Yesterday's songs
Don't seem to belong
They're here and they're gone
Yesterday's moves
Don't stay in the grooves
They keep moving on

Maybe yesterday's rhyme
Was for yesterday's time
And the future's not ours to see
But there's some things that always will be
Like sayin' ""I love you""
Sayin' ""I love you""

Baby, yesterday's blues
May be yesterday's news
But the truth always stays the same
And the good things will never change

12,Comin' In And Out Of Your Life,"I still can remember
The last time I cried
I was holding you and loving you
Knowing it would end

I never felt so good
Yet felt so bad
You're the one I love
And what makes it sad
Is you don't belong to me

And I can remember
The last time I lied
I was holding you and telling you
We could still be friends

Tried to let you go
But I can't, you know
And even though I'm not with you
I need you so
But you don't belong to me

Chorus:
Comin' in and out of your life
Isn't easy
When there are so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
'cause I don't need to touch you
To feel you, it's so real with you

I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
A stronger love
Just can't be found
Even though at times this crazy world
Is turning up-side-down
You'll always belong to me

Oh, girl you know me
I'm alone until you show me
That you're still in love with me

When I see you in the morning
That old sleep still in your eyes
I remember all the laughter
And the tears we shared last night

[PreChorus 1]
And as we lie here, just two shadows
In the light before the dawn
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

[Chorus]
And I have never been afraid of losing
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

[Verse 2]
Now, you and I, we're not children
We have both been loved before
We have given and we have taken
Many rides on troubled shores

[PreChorus 2]
And all the heartaches and temptations
Only make me love you more
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

I dream about you and now summer's come and gone

How love's supposed to last forever

So there's no sense pretending
My heart it's not mending

And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without you

On my own
I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain

I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own

I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

[Chorus]
Work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People callin' me, askin' me for money, man
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 3]
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh, I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin', I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me

[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya.

31,You Could Have Been With Me,"You're the seventh son of the seventh son
Maybe that's why you're such a strange and special one
You can't even seem to love yourself
And with a few exceptions, not anybody else

You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink
You can give a man your whole heart and soul, but you cannot make him think

Chorus:
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely

You can tell him the day of departure, exactly the place and the time
He might really wanna be there, but he misses every time
Is he a man or a paper tiger
When you need him will he run or stand beside you

32,Leader Of The Band,"An only child alone and wild
A cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none --
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know
I never can repay
A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once
But his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls
Took me years to understand
The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy
To the leader of the band
My brothers' lives were different
For they heard another call
One went to Chicago
And the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose
And come to know so well
(Instrumental)
I thank you for the music
And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go --
I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough
And, papa, I don't think I
Said 'I love you' near enough --
The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy
To the leader of the band
I am the living legacy

33,Heart Like A Wheel,"In these days of confusion
You've turned angry and cold
You say it's an illusion
There's no fire in your soul
Say you don't love me
Say you don't care
But don't leave me standing here
Your heart's like a wheel
Just waiting to roll
It's longing for freedom
To get out on the road
You're hungry for something
That you may never find
So many reasons
Your love has made you blind
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
So don't leave me standing here
Don't leave me standing here
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
Don't leave me
Don't leave me standing here
Life ain't been easy
Full of passion and pain
Told me no reason
Why I was to blame
Don't leave me standing
Don't leave me standing
Don't leave me standing

To dance, but tonight may be the night

And I might lose my balance
Because I hit that blunt too many times
Come down, is what I have to tell myself
Cause when I get in my zone

And my outfit's so fly
They telling me I should relax
But I'm like, why?

Maybe old feelings will come through
Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away
Maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
And make her wanna stay

It's been too many hours I've wasted staring at the phone

I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never thought that I would get caught
It seemed like a perfect crime

[Chorus]
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree

[Verse 2]
I thought it would be so simple
Like a thousand times before
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy
Go ahead and throw the book at me
If loving you's a crime
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be

[Chorus]
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key

44,Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do),"[Verse 1]
Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

[Chorus]
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

[Verse 2]
Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

[Chorus (Repeat Until Fade-Out)]
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true",Christopher Cross,1981,"[45, 36, 31, 17, 9, 9, 9, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 7, 7, 9, 24, 31, 51, 71]",20
45,If I Were You,"[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже

[Куплет 1]
Когда мы были кореша
Мы разбежались, неизбежно бабки крутят этот шар
Холодная сталь оставляет шрам
У одних вызывает страх, другим даёт свой шанс
Жизнь даёт вам шанс, хватай его сейчас
Мне не нужен твой барыга, оставь его себе на чай
Говорил тебе, парень, с самого начала
Твоя сука зашла «ВКонтакт» и всё себе скачала
Как она кричала, боже, как кончала
Она вся протекла, и ей походу мало
Нет, нет, нет, тебе не поможет мама
Да, да, да, я забрал тебя так рано
Теперь мой счёт прибавил пару нулей
Но я никогда не менял бабки на людей
Бабки - на людей, братьев - на блядей
Ты сучья гнида, мы словимся попозже, всё окей

[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже

[Куплет 2]
Сука, ты выродок, сука, ты выблядок
Никто не будет терпеть тебя, никто не будет терпеть твоих выходок
Ты живёшь ради выгоды, мы живём ради выхлопа
Все ваши рэперы в сторонке тихо и нервно курят у выхода
Я нажимаю на «Play» — играет Big Daddy Kane
И, сука, так каждый день, да, мама, я – бэнгер
И мы, словно, бля, в танке, мы заходим за рамки
Ты продался давно, оставь своё музло на платной стоянке
Многие хотят делать этот трэп-щит
Я не слышу их, мэн, кто там пищит?
Просто пойми, ты предназначен для других целей
И просто пойми, мы знаем всю правду, увидишь всё в свете
Эти дети говорят о том, чего никогда не видели в жизни
Посмотри на себя, думаешь, бог приготовил для тебя именно это?
Толкать наркоту на районе? Нет, парень, это не так
Возьми всё в свое руки, будь одержим

[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже",Kizaru,1981,"[46, 50, 59, 67, 75, 85]",6

47,Let Me Love You Once,"When there's something I can't have
I only want it more
You know I sure found out the hard way
That it's true
'Cause there's a storm inside of me
From wantin' you
How I wish that I'd found you in time
'Cause now you're his and can't be mine

But you can start a fire raging
Just by touching me
Even though I know
We're not supposed to touch
Oh, I've never wanted anyone so much
How I wish that I had found you first
Can't you see my heart's about to burst

So let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me
So don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me

Let me lock the door
And open all my love to you
All the love I've longed to give you
Since we met
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get
And I just can't let it disappear
Oh my darling, please come over here

And let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me
So don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me

Let me lock the door
And open all my love to you
All the love I've longed to give you
Since we met
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get
And I just can't let it disappear
Oh my darling, please come over here

And let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me
So don't keep saying no

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

[Chorus]
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

[Verse 2]
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

A thousand kisses from you is never too much

You keep me all together
You take me out whenever I'm lettin' down

I fly across the floor
I can see you comin' on me
And I can't ask for more

Rake me, shake me

It was the hardest thing to put them away

Breakin' those habits
Was hard to do
But nothin' compared to the changes
That you put me through

Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared
It was the hardest burden I'll ever bear

I had the worst reputation in town
For chasing all the women around
I thought changin' my way of living was hard to do
But it's nothin' compared to the changes that you put me through

I've done everything I tried to do
But it's gonna take a miracle to get me over you

Dark clouds form on the western sky

Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, that true shit
That shit to make you feel shit
To all my niggas and my bitches
Yo, check it, uh huh

[Verse 1: Havoc]
It's kinda bug how I dose sometimes; know they staring
Brain feels like a wheel lost without the ball bearing
Stuck, contemplating who I can trust
But like llello in a bill my feelings just get crushed
But thats why I stick with my duns, like I stick with the guns
Don't get mad, rip your hun, concentrate on my funds
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist
Never get patted down when I step in the place
Jiggied up, scope the spot, confirm beef, if it's not
Bally up, after this get followed straight to the crib
Gem star, double edge apply pressure
Shave 'em down, blow marks intruding through your mecca
Wanna be a thug, now you got the thug look
Stick 'em up, leave Medicaid with the bill to foot
God-Body, with a rubber grip black shottie
Pump one in that ass make a nigga switch hobbies
A dosage, hand delivered, without postage
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice
Niggas get sniped like, clog your bronchite
Show 'em how to rock right, when bitches are holdin mics

[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (street life)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues
This is real, this is ill street news
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck
And now his brother not giving a fuck
Little sister giving up the butt now, dun don't wet that
I want you to rest black, 'cause you can believe that Noyd gon' handle that
Cause when I get 'em, I'm gonna have 'em
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at 'em
I'm no killer, you know me
But I'll be damned if I don't ride for my co-D
And then this OG, scold me, and told me, coldly
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homie
But I, gotta redeem, get this cream by any means
I never been clean
Nigga, my whole click got dirty
From the vials, to the trials and the bloodied up syrtie
Nigga you heard me, it's gangsta (and to the block)

[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (and to the block)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Vision the canvas I paint a picture
Similar to Ernies Barnes, nigga
But mines is more ghetto more guns
More drugs, mostly thugs
All my dunns, their baby moms daughter and sons
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out
Park benches is broke, a nigga stretched out
Jumped off the roof and fell to his death, it's real
Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murals
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building
Devil's Spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing
Grams get dipped, 50's is moked, cookies is broke
And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off, don't get clipped off
(Street life)

[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say

Like a child's eyes on a Christmas night
I'm looking at you now, finding answers to my prayers

It's a new day for those good old dreams

Here's the morning that just had to come through

You're a spark of a long forgotten fire
You're a touch of a slowly growing wind
You're a taste of the ever changing seasons
Telling me there are some things that don't end

We have left all the darkness far behind us
All those hopes that we held along the way, have made it to this day
Like an old love song, gone for much too long
You hear it once again and it carries you away

It's a new day for those good old dreams
One by one it seems they're coming true
Here's the morning that my heart had seen
Here's the morning that just had to come through

Same old stage but what a change of scene

Down the mountainside
To the coastline
Past the angry tide
The mighty diesel whines

And the tunnel comes
And the tunnel goes
Round another bend
The giant drivers roll

I fired the Daylight
When I turned sixty-five
I couldn't see right

We've got to let you go
It's company policy
You've got a pension though""

Roll on, Southern Pacific
On your silver rails
On your silver rails
Roll on, Southern Pacific
On your silver rails
Through the moonlight

I put in my time
I put in my time
Now I'm left to roll
Down the long decline
I am no brake man
I am no conductor
But I would be though
If I was younger

80,Sausalito Summernight,"We left for Frisco in your Rambler
The radiator running dry
I've never been much of a gambler
And had a preference to fly

You said, forget about the airline
Let's take the car and save the fare
We blew a gasket on the Grapevine
And eighty dollars on repairs

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Hot summer night in Sausalito
Can't stand the heat another mile
Let's drop a quarter in the meter
And hit the sidewalk for a while

I'll have a burger and a root beer
You feed the heap some multi-grade
A shot of premium to boot, dear
We'll get across the Golden Gate

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Another mile or two to Frisco
Two hundred gallons from L.A
The engine's thumpin' like a disco
We ought to dump her in the bay

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Cashin' all my checks, scrapin' out my bank
Spend it on a Rambler with a whirlpool in the tank
Look out over here, watch out over there
Can't afford a blowout 'cause we haven't got a spare

I swear youve taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, Ive always been so glad
To be with you … through the years
Its better everyday, youve kissed my tears away
As long as its okay, Ill stay with you
Through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong, I know that I belonged
Right here with you … through the years
I never had a doubt, wed always work things out
Ive learned what loves about, by loving you

You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain

I'll be a fool
For you
I'm sure

95,Hard To Say,"[Verse 1]
Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other

[Chorus 1]
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

[Chorus 2]
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

[Verse 2]
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love

[Chorus 1]
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know

[Chorus 1]
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to

96,Controversy,"[Verse 1]
I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cuz you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - ""What have I got to lose?""

[Chorus]
And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

[Verse 2]
I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - ""Baby, have you got enough gas?""
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Yes you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last (Oh, oh)

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

[Chorus 2]
Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down (Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red corvette right in the ground
(Little Red Corvette)
Right down to the ground (Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down
(Little Red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

I do want you, I do need you
I do want you, I do need you

98,Twilight,"[Verse 1]
In 7th Grade, we promised that we'd never break each other's heart
Fought with the pressure of deep depression while naked making confessions
Underneath the covers, coloring in the dark
Gave LaToya my information and she ain't even call
Could it be women's intuition telling her I'm a dog?
Criminally involved, past-tense on my prior history dealing with the law
And this is no facade, refrigerator in my chest just like Omarion
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Excuse - that's just a broken heart
I'll think that I'll just hang out here for tonight
(Say Gates, what you doing?)
Playing songs on my invisible guitar

[Hook]
Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

[Verse 2]
Every time we talk, it's like you end up getting aroused
Standing, while I'm sitting down with my fingers under your blouse
Still looking you in the eye, you're looking back into mine
If I told you I was different, would you understand the difference?
Try to suppress the feeling of this different way of living
Creatures of the night - we gon be alright
In the twilight
Skin gleamin', labeled a demon cause I can't even die
The curse of eternity - God created me, but why?
If I turn you into I, your age would never age and forever be by my side
Spoke about the wisdom that entered into my thoughts
The will of the universe, including the Willendorf
This is art
I'm a God

[Hook]
Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

I would go to war with God...to war with God, to war with God..",Kevin Gates,1981,"[99, 89, 69, 38, 38, 43, 48, 55, 67, 79]",10
99,Sharing The Love,"Take it from me, I've had the experience
Finding the right love ain't easy to do
I've been looking and looking and searching around since
Nature started teching me just what to do

I can feel it bubbling up
All this love needs somewhere to live
Come and take a drink from my cup
I have a heart with so much to give

All the love is here so take it
Darlin' you know we can make it

I knew the minute I saw you
You were the one who'd be
Sharin' the love
I have the feeling inside me
You'll be beside me
Sharin' the love

I never believed in love at first sight
It's a foolish dreamer's fantasy
But one look at you showed me the light
And made a foolish dreamer of me

I can feel it bubbling up
All this love needs somewhere to live
Come and take a drink from my cup
I have a heart with so much to give

All the love is here so take it
It would be a sin to waste it

I knew the minute I saw you
You were the one who'd be
Sharin' the love
I have the feeling inside me
You'll be beside me

100,Step By Step,"[Intro]
Oh
Ciao Mario
Fre' com'è?
Ti dico solo che
Son venuto a Corni oggi
È degenerata e devo ancora dormire

[Strofa 1: Bresh]
Sto contando i giri che la terra compie nell'arco di un anno
Mentre passa il tempo filtrano gli amici scarto quelli a babbo
Non è novità, se dal basso fra' poi nasce un bastardo
Questa polvere non migliora ma vola come a maggio
Come in moto corro, come treno torno
Ma non mi aspettare che non ti riprendo
Muri di cemento dalle parti
Questo amaro freddo mi ha ghiacciato il petto
La mia civiltà fa pubblicità
Con gli occhi coperti dalla bella vita
Non conosco fra' solidarietà
Se negli anticorpi sgamo un parassita
Temo sia finito il tempo, pure 'sta canna è finita
Fermo a motore spento, tengo il mio girovita

[Bridge: Bresh]
Non hai parole per distrarci
Non basterebbe neanche il meglio che hai
Fra tutti i posti in cui potevo finire a cacciarmi
Fare i normali non ci è piaciuto mai

[Ritornello: Tedua]
Perché quando mi chiama lei
Sento dei presentimenti
E per certi versi io pretendo apprezzi
Beh, che fare
Non ho un re di cuori
Con te che mi pare
A guardie fai nomi
Loro non hanno capito che sopra al set
Questo spartito cosa direbbe?
Beh, vedi te
Non servirebbe deridere
Fuori dal gregge correre che
Non ci potranno correggere

[Strofa 2: Tedua]
Tedua, fuori siamo fiori
Non ho fori sul muro
Se mi curo il culo, paraculi
Avete scudi, scusi
Siamo cugi, stiamo cuci-nando curvi
E la schiena ci si piega in QT
Danna ad altrui
Appunti, scritte ed ardui ahh
Risarcisca il danno fatto
La perquisa trae in inganno
Mentre me la fa il mio fra' la sta spargendo
Fuori peso in pieno autunno
L'uso delle parole è essenziale, sensuale
Senza un senso sensoriale
È tentare di internare in te il male
Per un testo intenzionale, ah beh
La mia gang sta volando, cazzo
Dobbiamo passare un altro step by step
O ai re dei re sarò l'erede del drepa mio pazzo
A te che nella scena fai il boss
Ma non hai scomodato il culo
So che vuoi un po' del mio flow
Ma non è in comodato d'uso

Through the lights in a hot new rent a car
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine
It’s a scene down on Sunset Boulevard

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby

Johnny's taking care of things for awhile
And his style is so right for troubadours
(Troubadours, right for troubadours)
They got him sitting with his back to the door
Now he won't be my mascot anymore

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby

Moving on is a chance you take any time
You try to stay together, oh
Say the word and a lie and you find
That the friends you had are gone
Forever
(Forever)
Forever

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye

So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last, some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes
I’m afraid it's time for goodbye again

Tell you you're mine
But I just can't seem to make that move or to say those words
Somethin' inside me just holds me back

I want to save so much fun with you
I'm lost for words, I just can't begin

Baby, didn't you know it
Girl, I just don't show it
But I'm just too shy
Did you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy

Maybe time will bring a change in me
Loving is you is not as easy as I thought it would be

Didn't you should know by now

105,Talking Out Of Turn,"When I took a little loving from you
Oh I, never thought about the hurting inside
But I took a little more than I should
Oh why, can't explain that I would ever
Let you slip through my fingers
Let you escape like yesterday
I would appreciate you knowing
I thought your love had come to stay

Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn
Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn

But I took a little more of your each day
When I didn't see that I was breaking you apart
With angry words of love I didn't mean
Oh why, can't believe that I would ever
Talk myself out of tomorrow
Talked like a fool to yesterday
And as the evening loses colour
Your love began to fade away

Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn
Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn

Talking out of turn
Talking out of turn

If I upset you
I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't mean to make you cry
I don't need an alibi
To start me talking out of turn

When I took a little loving from you
Oh I, can't believe that I would ever
Let you slip through my fingers
Let you escape like yesterday
I would appreciate you knowing
I thought your love had come to stay

108,Promises In The Dark,"I was 23 and living in the city
I met a long-legged blonde on friday night
It was a head on collision of passion
We made wild-eyed, loose-lipped love all night
On saturday we went out dancing
I could see she wanted to be free
She said, ""darling, I'm sorry to leave you this way...""
I said, ""how can you walk out on me? ""

(chorus)
She said, ""hey, hey, my, my, what's the story?
How can you say I broke your heart?
Someone as old as you should never look for the truth
In promises made in the dark.""

Well, I went back to her apartment
I waited all night in my car
When she got there I said, ""hey you can't take him to bed!""
She said, ""who in the hell do you think you are? ""

Chorus

When her boyfriend pulled out a revolver
I smiled and I said my farewells
Love can take you to the sun, love can take you to the moon
It's not worth getting you killed

109,The Cowboy And The Lady,"In the airport lounge she sat in a fancy feathered hat
The grandest lady I had ever seen
Outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes
So I asked her if she'd like some company

In my rhinestone studded suit, My cowboy hat and boots
I must have been a sight to see
But she said ""Pull up a chair,"" as she fumbled with her hair
A more unlikely pair you'll never see

I was Mogen David wine, she was Chabls Fifty-nine
But there we sat, the cowboy and the lady
She was evenings at the opera and summers in Paree
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee

The cowboy and the lady
As diff'rent as could be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee

And somewhere in between her Harvey's Bristol Creme
And the beer I drank and the easy company
We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cowboy
And there's a little bit of cowboy in the lady

The cowboy and the lady
As diff'rent as could be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee

We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cowboy
And there's a little bit of cowboy in the lady",John Denver,1981,"[98, 78, 66, 66, 73, 73, 85]",7
110,Magic Power,"Something's at the edge of your mind
You don't know what it is
Something you were hoping to find
But you're not sure what it is
Then you hear the music
And it all comes crystal clear
The music does the talking
Says the things you want to hear

I'm young, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music in me
I'm young, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music in me

She climbs into bed
She pulls the covers overhead
And she turns her little radio on
She's had a rotten day
So she hopes the DJ's
Gonna play her favorite song

Makes her feel much better
Brings her closer to her dreams
A little magic power
Makes it better that it seems

She's young now, she's wild now, she wants to be free
She gets the magic power of the music from me
She's young now, she's wild now, she wants to be free
She gets the magic power of the music from me

You're thinking it over
But you just can't sort it out
Do you want someone to tell you
What they think it's all about
Are you the one and only
Who's sad and lonely
You're reaching for the top
Well, the music keeps you going
And it's never gonna stop
It's never gonna stop
It's never gonna, never gonna, never gonna, never gonna stop

The world is full of compromise
And infinite red tape
But the music's got the magic
It's your one chance for escape
Turn me on, turn me up
It's your turn to dream
A little magic power
Makes it better than it seems

I'm young now, I'm wild now, I want to be free
Got the magic power of the music in me
I'm young now, I'm wild and I'm free
Got the magic power of the music
I got the music in me

I got the power
I got the magic
She's got the power
She's got the magic
She's got the power
She's got the magic
She's got the power

112,Who's Crying Now,"[Verse 1]
It's been a mystery
And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

[Chorus]
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder, who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

[Verse 2]
So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth
The love they save

[Chorus]
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

[Verse 3]
Only so many tears you can cry
'Till the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die

Whoooooa-oh-whoa
Whoooa-oh

Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative

Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, ""I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'""

I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's Goodz rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see Goodz I give his goods back
I rap for writers that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress

Two suitcases, dangle from his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
He screwfaced the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery

Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket

'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
So hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover

Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

I lost my heart inside a dream
Of diamond rings and finer things
We never die, forever young
Fell for you once, I'll dive again
Through heaven, hell, against the wind
We love like simple people do

[Chorus]
Oh every night I close my eyes
I see the sun and you're my paradise
And when you lost and go too far
I'll be the light you run to in the dark
I'll be the light you run to in the dark

[Verse 2]
Your silver tongue is full of lies
With tricks and thrills and Bambi eyes
I pray you'll never feel this way
Show me the things I won't goodbye
Like wolves we run into the night
Our lives will never be the same

[Chorus]
Every night I close my eyes
I see the sun and you're my paradise
And when you lost and go too far
I'll be the light you run to in the dark

[Chorus 2]
Every night I close my eyes
I see your face and I'm right awake
And when we say our last goodbye
I'll be the one t' say I hope you stay

I lost my heart inside a dream

Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me

I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys no

Don't you know you can tell everyone that we're through
You might even believe it too
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me

I'll be the face that you see in the crowd
I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around

Never understand
Take the hidden wish to death
And laugh and laugh and catch your breath
And forget that every word's been said
We'll walk hand in hand

We'll walk hand in hand
As the world expands
The pair must face the final fling
The hook and ladder, a fatal swing
The sign looks missed, the marks we've placed
The playful grin that won't erase
We'll walk hand in hand

We'll walk hand in hand
Across a foreign land
See your face with sultry pearls
In heaven snow makes caroler girls
Until when any burnoff glows ablaze
We'll walk hand in hand

We'll walk hand in hand
Never as we planned
And even those we never knew
Fast they disappear from view
Fading world without a price
Right before our very eyes
Melts before our very eyes
Dies before our very eyes

And even though we feel the burn
We careen past the heavy turn
Push, then pull to scale the hill
Then miss the cliff, don't take the spill
Until we can't withstand
We'll walk hand in hand

Running from the pull of tide
Fumbling from the creeping time
Running out...of whim and rhyme
We'll walk hand in hand
Till we understand
And everything to be despised
Right before our very eyes
Forced before our very eyes
Dies before our very eyes

146,Slow Hand,"As the midnight moon, was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine
Seein' what you wanted to see

Darlin', don't say a word, cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind

I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night

Darlin', don't say a word, cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooo, we got the time

Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand

Ooh ooh ooh

Pick yourself up
And get yourself ready

Wave your arms
Let me hear you yell
We're gonna rap about General Hospital

It started out in Port Charles town
Where Frank Smith's mob used to hang around
No one could prove that he was a crook
Till Luke stole his little black book

It had names and numbers all in code
So Luke and Laura had to hit the road
They had to find the left-handed boy
Watch their step
They had to be coy

The gold involved was worth so much
Others wanted it like Sally and Hutch
But there's one thing I must confess
Sally was a man who wore a dress

Luke kept his cool
He ain't no fool
He set them both up cold
Well Sally died
Hutch survived
And no one got the gold

Paging Dr. Noah Drake
To ICU
To treat a case of heartbreak

They keep me waiting
I don't mind waiting
Don't call me crazy
No, I'm not lazy

My knees start aching

Monica likes to have her fun
That is why she had a son
She told Rick he was the dad
Soon found out that he'd been had

That you can give me that Leslie can't

Alan was the father of course
And he won't give Monica a divorce
Rick wants to get Leslie back
Heather's having an insane attack

I'll get Diana Taylor
She's not crazy
Uh, uh
No never
She just wants to get Dr. Jeff Webber

Jeff wants Annie for his wife
But he might have to wait all of his life
Cause good girls don't
And Annie won't
And you all know what I mean

Amy Vining likes to blab
Richard Simmons helps fight flab
Susan's having Alan's baby
Noah wants Bobbi for his lady

Well, Luke got another job
The Quartermaines are the brand new mob
Laura's the receptionist
What's missing now is the Ice Princess

Yes, Luke Spencer

See the picture been cropped up for me
A great conversation is good food for thought
And we tend to treat it like a fuckin’ potluck shorty
What did you bring?
I brought more than pillow talk with me
Fuck what you thought
And they hate when you do it for the feel

Need you to be real no matter how you think I might feel

But I’m off the booze and buddah so then Imma have to go get me a Uber
Earlier I was at Lollapalooza but thinking that I wanna do you
But now it’s a matter of time and I feel like I gotta go get it before they pursue you
Pull up in front of your crib and I don’t care if it’s the AM
Feeling so good up off of the liquor that’s in me I be praying that she home like amen
Get up out the car and I be wobbling and call and let her know that I’m on my way in
Strike a pose and then I told her to take her clothes off
Glad she ain’t sleep, finna hit the ass soon
She went to the bathroom, I dozed off

154,"Theme From ""Greatest American Hero"" (Believe It or Not)","[Provost Vincent Price]
As Provost, I have the honor of introducing our speaker.

Now, unlike him, I don’t rhyme a lot, but distinguished guests, like it or not, now’s the time for me to take my shot.

To show these graduates what I’ve got, and to explain Mr. Miranda why you’re about to take my spot. He grew up in the Bronx neighborhood of Inwood. An immigrant son whose father had come from Puerto Rico to the Big Apple. He came north to grapple, to seek a better life for himself and his people. Advising Mayor Koch on making things equal.

Mr. Miranda knows the Founding Fathers but he never bothered with Benjamin Franklin. You see— you see, Quakers, he didn’t go to Penn. His alma mater, that great school, Wesleyan. When he got there, he picked up a pen and, out of nowhere, the show tunes came to him. He founded a group, a comedy troupe, the Freestyle Love Supreme.

He wrote and directed it, unaffected by rejection, and after four years, elected to follow his dream. And that dream was to write and create, stories to demonstrate both love and hate. People who tried to advocate for those society dominates and how our fate can fluctuate forcing us to recalibrate the people who make this country great.

Now, our honored guest knows that Broadway shows can open and then close if the critics oppose. The audience slows, you see empty rows, and soon that petal falls off that particular rose. But he took flight, with In the Heights. The line snaked out of sight, and by all rights those Broadway lights they shone so bright, each and every night.

And then Mr. Miranda got a call from a Miss Tony, saying something about some big ceremony. Miss Tony said, “You should make room on your shelf. Four gold trophies. Three for your show, one for yourself.”

A rapid ascent, this was not his intent, but while it meant it paid the rent. Yet Mr. Miranda was still not content, a quick look at a book and then he was hooked, an incredible life that had been overlooked. It was Ron Chernow’s story of guts and glory. A man with a quill whose grill is still on the ten-dollar bill.

This was a fatherless man from the lowest station, who went from poverty to help found a nation. An immigrant, a striver, a man with drive. A founder’s tale that had to be told in a way that appealed to both young and old. This was the hero of an American sort, a Caribbean import. A life that was cut short. A man who wrote, and spoke, and dueled by the gun. A man who went by Hamilton.

Well, that show is still on the rise, let me emphasize and allow me to publicize, Hello Mr. Pulitzer Prize! You know the rest, and you know our guest. He is truly blessed with what educators try to do best. They open our eyes, they catalyze. They help us realize, make ideas truly come alive.

Graduates and guests that’s enough propaganda, put your hands together for Lin-Manuel Miranda!

[Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Yo! Someone call for the extra po-po’s, I’m ride or die for your Provost!

Bars! Bars on bars on bars!

Thank you, President Gutmann, MC Provost. Board of Trustees, faculty, family, Mr. Vice President, Undergraduates— The four Penn schools of Hufflepuff, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor, and dear exhausted, exhilarated, terrified graduates of the Class of 2016!

I begin with an apology. I’m the writer of Hamilton: An American Musical. Every word in the show, and there are over 22,000 words in the show, were chosen and put in a really specific order by me. So I am painfully aware that neither Philly nor the great state of Pennsylvania is mentioned in Hamilton with the exception of one couplet in the song, “Hurricane”, where Hamilton sings, “I wrote my way out of Hell, I wrote my way to revolution, I was louder than the crack in the bell!” That’s it. One blink-and-you-miss-it, Liberty Bell reference.

I am also painfully aware that this commencement address is being live streamed and disseminated all over the world instantly. In fact, painfully aware is pretty much my default state, “Oh yeah, that’s Lin, he’s… painfully aware”.

So with the eyes of the world and history on us all, I’d like to correct the record and point out that a few parts in Hamilton: An American Musical actually took place in Pennsylvania. The Battle of Monmouth, wherein General Charles Lee, in our show, “S’ed the bed” and retreated against Washington’s orders. According to Lafayette, this was the only time he ever heard George Washington curse out loud. That’s right, the father of our country dropped his choicest profanities and f-bombs in Pennsylvania.

The Constitutional Convention, wherein Alexander Hamilton spoke extemporaneously for six hours in what is surely the most untweetable freestyle of all time, happened right here in Philly. That’s right. In fact, Alexander Hamilton lived at 79 South 3rd Street when he began his extramarital affair with Maria Reynolds, creating the time-honored precedent of political sex scandals and mea culpa’s. You guys, The Good Wife wouldn’t even exist if Hamilton hadn’t gotten the ball rolling on this dubious American Tradition. Right on South 3rd Street, right near the Cosi.

Finally, I need to apologize on behalf of the historical Alexander Hamilton because if he hadn’t sat down to dinner with James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, desperate for support of his financial plan, Philadelphia might well still be the US Capital. Hamilton traded Philly away in the most significant back-room deal in American history. As the guy who plays Hamilton every night, let me get into character for a moment and say, “My bad, Philadelphia…”. Thank you.

But take the long view, MotownPhilly! Who really won that deal in the end? Look at DC, it’s synonymous with institutional dysfunction, partisan in-fighting, and political gridlock. You are known as the birthplace of Louisa May Alcott, Rocky Balboa, Boyz II Men, Betsy Ross, Will Smith, Isaac Asimov, Tina Fey, cheesesteaks, and you can have scrapple, soft pretzels, and Wawa hoagies whenever you want. You win, Philly! You win every time! Water ice.

The simple truth is this, every story you choose to tell, by necessity, omits others from the larger  narrative. One could write five totally different musicals from Hamilton’s eventful, singular American life without ever overlapping incidents. For every detail I chose to dramatize, there are ten I left out. I dramatized— I include King George at the expense of Ben Franklin. I dramatize Angelica Schuyler’s intelligence and heart at the expense of Benedict Arnold’s betrayal. James Madison and Hamilton were friends and political allies. But their personal and political fallout occurs right on our act break, during intermission.

My goal is to give you as much of an evening as musical entertainment can provide and have you on your way home slightly before Les Mis lets out next door. This act of choosing the stories we tell versus the stories we leave out will reverberate across the rest of your life. Don’t believe me? Think about how you celebrated this senior week and contrast that with the version you shared with your parents and grandparents sitting behind you. Penn, don’t front! You’re a ""Playboy Magazine""-ranked party school. You know you did things this week  that you’re never mentioning again! I know what you did this summer.

I’m going to tell you a story from my twenties today, a story I’ve never told in public before. I’ll tell you two stories actually. It’s my hope that it’ll be of use to you as you stare down the quarter life marker.

I’m twenty years old, finishing my sophomore year at Wesleyan, and my girlfriend of four and a half years is home from her semester abroad. I cannot wait to see her again. She is my first love. I dread seeing her again. I’ve grown into my life without her. In her absence, with time and angst to spare, I have developed the first draft of my first full-length musical, an eighty-minute One Act called n the Heights. I have also developed a blinding pain in my right shoulder which I can’t seem to stop cracking. My girlfriend comes home, I am so happy to see her even as my shoulder worsens. My mother takes me to a back specialist, ranked in New York Magazine so you know she’s good. He examines me, looks me dead in the eyes and says, “There’s nothing wrong with your back. There will be if you keep cracking it but what you have is a nervous tick. Is there anything in your life that’s causing you stress?” I burst into tears in his office. He looks at me for a long time, as I’m crying, and get this, you’ll appreciate this, Renee, he tells me the story of Giuseppe Verdi. A nineteenth century Italian composer of some note who, in the space of a few short years, lost his wife and two young children to disease. He tells me that Verdi’s greatest works, ""Rigoletto"", ""La Traviata"", came not before, but after this season of Job, the darkest moments of his life. He looks me in the eyes and tells me, “You’re trying to avoid going through pain, or causing pain. I’m here to tell you that you’ll have to survive it if you want to be any kind of artist.” I break up with my girlfriend that night. I spend the summer in therapy. I tell a lot of stories I’ve never told before. My father asks my mother, “What the hell kind of back doctor? Verdi!? Really!?!” I stop cracking my shoulder.

The story I had been telling myself, happy guy in a long distance relationship with his high school sweetheart, was being physically rejected by my body via my shoulder. I had never broken up with anyone before. In my head, I was a good guy and good guys don’t break up with their significant others when one of them goes off to study abroad. I was trying to fit my life into a romantic narrative that was increasingly at odds with how I really felt. In retrospect, we both were.

What about her story? Well it’s not mine to tell but I can share this much: She began dating one of her good friends the following year in college. Fast-forward to present day, she is happily married to that same good friend with two beautiful kids. In her story, I am not the angsty, shoulder-cracking tortured artist. I am the obstacle in the way of the real love story. For you ""Office"" fans, they’re Jim and Pam, and I’m Roy.

Story number two! I’m out of college. I’m twenty-three years old, and Tommy Kail and I are meeting with a veteran theatre producer. To pay rent, I am a professional substitute teacher at my old high school. Tommy is Audra McDonald’s assistant. Tommy is directing In The Heights and with his genius brain in my corner, my eighty-minute One Act is now two acts. This big deal theatre producer has seen a reading we put on in the basement of The Drama Book Shop in Midtown Manhattan and he is giving us his thoughts. We hang on his every word. This is a big deal theatre producer, and we are kids, desperate to get our show on. We are discussing the character of Nina Rosario, home from her first year at Stanford, the first in her family to go to college. The big deal theatre producer says, “Now, I know in your version, Nina’s coming home with a secret from her parents. She’s lost her scholarship. The song is great. The actress is great. What I’m bumping up against, fellas, is that this doesn’t feel high stakes enough. Scholarship, big deal. What if she’s pregnant? What if her boyfriend at school hit her? What if she got caught with drugs? It doesn’t have to be any of those things, you’re the writer. But do you see what I’m getting at, guys? A way to ramp up the stakes of your story?” I resist the urge to crack my shoulder. We get through the meeting and Tommy and I, again alone, look at each other. He knows what I’m gonna say before I say it:

“Pregnant…”

“I know”

“Nina on drugs…”

“I was there”

“But he wants to put our show up”

Tommy looks at me.

“That’s not the story you want to tell, and that’s not the show I want to direct. There are ways to raise the stakes that are not…that. We’ll just keep working”

If I could get in a time machine, and watch any point in my life it would be this moment. The moment where Tommy Kail looked at uncertain, frazzled me, desperate for a production and a life in this business, tempted, and said “No” first. I keep subbing, he continues working for Audra, we keep working on In the Heights for five years until we find the right producers in Jill Furman and Kevin McCollum and Jeffrey Seller. Until Philly native, Quiara Hudes becomes my co-writer and reframes our show around a community instead of a love triangle. Until Alex Lacamoire and Bill Sherman take my songs and make them come to life through their orchestrations. It will be another five years before ""Heights"" reaches Broadway, exactly as we intended it. And then the good part! Nina’s story, that we fought to tell, keeps coming back around in my life. It comes around in letters, or in the countless young men and women who find me on the subway, or on college campuses and take my hand and say, “You don’t understand, I was the first in my family to go to college. When I felt out of place, like I was drowning, I listened to ‘Breathe’, Nina’s song, and it got me through.” And I think to myself, as these strangers tell me their Nina stories. “I do understand. That sounds pretty high stakes to me.”

I know that many of you made miracles happen to get to this day. I know that parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles and family behind you made miracles happen to be here. I know because my family made miracles happen for me to be standing here talking to you, telling stories. Your stories are essential. Don’t believe me? In a year when politicians traffic in anti-immigrant rhetoric, there is also a Broadway musical reminding us that a broke, orphan immigrant from the West Indies built our financial system. A story that reminds us that—since the beginning of the great unfinished symphony that is our American experiment—time and time again, immigrants get the job done!

My dear terrified graduates. You’re about to enter the most uncertain and thrilling period of your lives. The stories you are about to live are the ones you will be telling your children and grandchildren and therapists. They are the temp gigs and internships before you find your passion. They are the cities you live in before the opportunity of a lifetime pops up halfway across the world. They are the relationships in which you hang on for dear life even as your shoulder cracks in protest. They are the times you say no to the good opportunities so you can say yes to the best opportunities. They are what Verdi survived to bring us La Traviata. They are the stories in which you figure out who you are. There will be moments you remember and whole years you forget. There will be times when you are Roy and there will be times when you are Jim and Pam. There will be blind alleys and one night wonders and soul crushing jobs and wake up calls and crises of confidence and moments of transcendence when you are walking down the street and someone will thank you for telling their story because it resonated with their own.

I feel so honored to be a detail, a minor character in the story of your graduation day. I feel so honored to bear witness to the beginning of your next chapter. I’m painfully aware of what’s at stake. I can’t wait to see how it turns out. Thank you and congratulations to the Class of 2016!",Lin-Manuel Miranda,1981,"[96, 82, 51, 35, 32, 25, 15, 12, 10, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 20, 27, 44, 49, 62, 73, 85]",26

156,Wired For Sound,"Word of mouth is the counselor
There is no need for proof
In a world that's wired for sound
The tongue becomes the mighty sword
That battles the truth
In a world that's wired for sound

Coming on like a tidal wave
That washes through the brain-a state of mind
No dispute when the noise is made
And so it lets the blind lead the blind
Lured by charisma to be swayed to believe

Word of mouth is the counselor
There is no need for proof
In a world that's wired for sound
The tongue becomes the mighty sword
That battles the truth
In a world that's wired for sound

Easier believing what is hard to get rid of than to try
Never searching-just accepting
Feeds the mind enough to get you by
Scratching the surface yet to dig deeper down

Word of mouth is the counselor
There is no need for proof
In a world that's wired for sound
The tongue becomes the mighty sword
That battles the truth
In a world that's wired for sound

Is turned and ignored

Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her

Leila, Leila, Leila-lo!

[Куплет 1]
Свободными ветрами между строк мы теряем контроль
Я разгоняю волны в океане твоих милых глаз
Ты скромную улыбку свою от меня прошу не скрой
Моя родная Лейла-Ло, неземная Лейла-Ло

[Куплет 2]
Зачем мне нужен мир в котором нету места для нас?
Мне нужен мир в котором кроме нас нету никого
Ведь если ты не рядом все вокруг теряет окрас

Шелковое платье цвета алого заката
Дарит мне мотивы что поет моя душа
Сердце пишет строки посылая к черту разум
Напевая день за днем неземная Лейла-Ло

Мы оставим наши чувства далеко за кадром
Берег обнимает потихоньку прибой
Я обниму тебя на фоне алого заката

167,Fire In The Sky,"[Verse 1]
It's the beat that never stops
In my blood that never flows
There's no substance in my life
It's that rush that never dies

[Verse 2]
Blood red, be cool
I'll catch the tears that you fall
Distance, I'm feeling
Your embrace I'm needing
Baby blue, I'll miss you
I'll count the days till I kiss you
So far and so gone
Be the right in my wrong
My wrong

What you've been doin'?
Boy, it's been such a long time since I seen you girl
You haven't changed that much
You look good
The high school days and college, oh

I haven't seen you in a long, long time
I haven't seen you since God knows when

You're so fine, you're so good lookin'
I can't compare you with no one else

Has your life been fulfilled, can we talk awhile
'Cause it's been so long, I'm so glad to see you again
It's been so long, I'm so glad to see you again
Has your life been fulfilled
Are you reachin' all your goals, are you reachin' all your goals
Are you truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly happy

(By the way how do you feel)
Hey, got married
But it don't really matter (Are you happy)
No, it don't
It don't really matter
No
Because I'm so glad to see you
Been such a long, long time
You know
You look so fine, you're so good lookin'

Just like the time when you just liked standing on the corner, you know
Some people go back to the 50's, 60's, 70's

But that's better than settle down

Sure I always talk of leaving
Guess that's why you can't believe it
Have a guitar to say my feelings
That's pretty much for what I'm living

You know lately I feel scared
And I always act like I don't care
It's not the first time that I just stare
Just to be pain spared

Sure I always talk of leaving
Guess that's why you can't believe it
Have a guitar to say my feelings

Baby, what's happening
Entre vous Lady Tee
I've heard a boatload of others ladies' raps
But they ain't got nothin' on me

I like sophisticated funk
I live on Dom Perignon, caviar, filet mignon
And you can best believe that's bunk
Here's what I'm talking, baby
Square Biz, Square Biz
I've been called Casper, Shorty, Lil' Bit
And some they call me Vanilla Child
But you know that don't mean my world to me
Cause baby, names can't cramp my style

A little hot water corn bread
I love you too Cat daddy
But don't you let that go to your head
That's what I'm talking, baby

You know I like spirituals and rock
Sarah Vaughn, Johann Sebastian Bach
Shakespeare, Maya Angelou
And Nikki Giovanni just to name a few

Go hand in hand together
When you think you've gotten over one

Ever lovin' you
But just when I've convinced myself
It's over with, then I hear

That old song that they used to play (That old song)
On the radio just about every day
And whenever I hear it all I can do
Is reminisce about lovin' you

That old song that they still play (That old song)
Keeps me longin' for the good old days
The lyric and the melody (Melody)
Remindin' me how in love we used to be

I shouldn't be tellin' you this
I know that I'm out of place (Out of place)
But when I love another woman
I can still see your face, baby

Maybe this is a sign for us (We should get back)
To try and get back together
You can't imagine that those memories (Those memories)
Do to me every time I hear

That old song that they used to play (That old song)
On the radio just about every day
Whenever I hear it all I can do
Is reminisce about lovin' you

That old song that they still play (That old song)
Keeps me longin' for the good old days
The lyric and the melody (Melody)
Remindin' me how in love we used to be

(That old song)
Think of you and me
Every time I hear that song

I recall the good times
When I hear that song, that song, that song
Makin' me realize
That I want you back, girl

Every time I hear that song (Keep on playin' that old song)
Keep on playin' that old song
Ooh, when I hear that song (Keep on playin' that old song)
It reminds me of a love so strong, mmm...

That we'd be able to keep it this way

176,Let's Put The Fun Back In Rock N Roll,"[Intro]
No smoking in the house
There's no smoking in the house
So would you please put it out?

[Verse]
I'm a animal nobody knows about like a lemur
That might wild the fuck out and kick you in the femur
Your girl said she a dreamer
I told her the closest she gon' get to that rock 'n' roll fame is this Cleveland steamer
Urban Dictionary that
Your bitch is very fat
On this dick is where she at
And to think you thought she was a church girl
Well she just gave her hotel information to my merch girl
Comfort Inn, room 703
Old school, no card, just a regular key
Most of America ain't checking for me
'Cause even my dumb shit is too much for 'em intellectually
So I'm, unappreciated like a bass solo
K Solo, or a porn star's face photo
Get out of Kansas and visit some other states, Toto
Start following Drake's motto or stay so-so
I was rhyming on the track
Way back when your mother's hymen was intact
Yo you probably shouldn't rap 'cause your words are wack
You need to find yourself a Cyrano de Bergerac
Or maybe you need to give up
You repeatedly suck
You in the league of a duck
You a measly schmuck
If you was speedily struck by a GMC truck
I wouldn't give one flying sixteenth of a fuck, nada
As far as new rappers I don't like none of 'em
I could single-handedly dismantle every one of 'em
I make fun of 'em and give zero fucks
I hate whoever you like, I think your heroes suck
I send 'em a old-fashioned ""fuck you"" like middle fingers
Thrown up by little old ladies with brittle fingers
Deadly like them little stingers on top of a scorpion
Or being at an appointment with Dr. Kevorkian
I make the best polka player drop his accordion
I make the best poker player stop with the tournaments
And switch to nickel slots at the Orleans
You wanna fuck with me you best cop a DeLorean
And go back in time and find the first time my young mind was inclined to rhyme
And feed it cyanide
And I know this a rhyme not a diatribe
But you are inscribed on the list of people I am not inspired by
I rap considerably well
So if you're considered hot then consider me hell
I've been cracked for awhile like the Liberty Bell
You're a story of regret people bitterly tell
You done nothing cool
You're a fucking fool
You're an example of the failure of the American public school
Yo, I will whoop your small fry ass
And then I'll mount you on my mantle like a walleye bass
But honestly I want peace, like Gandhi's dream
But when I see these wack rappers I get oddly mean
If I see 'em on my screen, I'll probably scream
It makes me want to turn the game to a zombie scene
Leg sweep 'em til they topple like a Ponzi scheme
I mix the old and the new, I'm a Fonzie meme
I'm a dubstep version of the Cosby theme
An iPhone 6 case that's Bing Crosby themed
A cross between Nas and Gene Krupa
My team super
You's an oompa loompa
Whose sweeter than a Chupa Chup bruh
Know what you should do bruh?
Go to Islamabad
Stand in the promenade and scream ""Muhammad's not a god""
Aww
Aren't you cute?
Kneeling in the desert in that orange jumpsuit
I'll probably see you next when we're in hell
I'll be selling portable fans
Holler if you need an extra Duracell
'Cause I'ma sell those too
I'll be the reason hell's hot and that hell froze too
Give a fuck who you know or who the hell knows you
You got the type of face people put elbows through
With no strings attached like a velcro shoe
Or how Run DMC wore the shell-toed shoe
When I rap I take you back to when it felt so new
With loads of hot goo I will pelt yo boo
It goes, shot, shot, shot
Like Mario Lemieux
Middle of the nipple and the areola too
Prepare to roll a few when my album leak
And make like a falcon beak atop a mountain peak that chirps how Alvin speaks
My voice projects, in an old school way
Like overheads
And goes over heads
Well of course over your head's where my lyricism's going
When your head level's so low it appears that you're limboing
Never tip-toeing
I'm a book that's ripped open
The lettering is blotchy with burn holes from smoking
You say no regrets
I say you must be joking
I squandered a lot so now I ponder a lot, like
That opportunity, could've surely paid off
Could've been big in the biz like Irving Azoff
Get away with more loot than Bernie Madoff
Dolphin face plates I'd be eating birthday cake off
But I ain't tryna let them guys in suits
Walk all over me like Thai masseuses
Hollywood is full of rich, fat, old dudes
Pointing at their trophy wives like ""I met that bitch at Whole Foods""
They say things like ""let's be in touch""
And get nothing but the finger like when lesbians touch
I don't walk around town as a pedestrian much
I don't place value on trophies thespians clutch
Not a bat of the eyes at the academy prize
The hype's horse shit
The flattery's lies
So if your mic's cordless I hope your battery dies
It's that type of performance I badly despise
Tell a critic write a song
Tell a blogger to perform it live
They'd have better luck playing Frogger on the 405
You don't stand on any ground on which to base judgments
Or stand underground as if you judge basements
Your list make these rappers conceited
High up in the ranks when they should be unseated
They overrated like french fries at In-N-Out
Or some other shit that I don't give a fucking shit about
You bloody marks are all snark
I can see you sippin' Cutty Sark in a golf cart
So meet me at the hipster bar and have a pickle back shot
I fucked your sister in her car back when Nickelback was hot
Back when me and Herbs would just kick it at the spot
With a 40 ounce of Mickies and a nickel sack of pot
But it's different now
In certain kinds of ways
Except that we still be blurting lines for days
And stepping out of that purple kind of haze
Only thing changed is the phrase ""no smoking in the house""

[Outro - Wax & Herbal T]
No smoking in the house (x5)
Please put it out, please put it out
Y'all little like Ford Fiats
Every track we drop are Basquiats, you biotch
You little like Ford Fiats
The tracks we drop are Basquiats, you biotch
We tall like pogo and Pau Gasol
Y'all bring beef like it's Fogo de Chão involved

[Herbal T]
2015!
Wax and Herbal T!
We in this bitch!

[Hook]
When we was little we was standing in the middle of the court and off we took
Pledge allegiance to the funk in every region where the left hand's on the book
We stick together like bird's of a feather 'cause we are family
And ain't a damn thing changed except for one new policy

Let them decide for themselves what kind of poisonous nonsense they wanna put in they lungs
As for myself I be smoking moonrocks
And I'm high as a motherfucker
Wax and Herbal T guide me through this absurd thing called life
And I am thankful for the funketh they giveth
Let's do this baby

[Hook]
When we was little we was standing in the middle
Of the court and off we took (we gotta take off)
Pledge Allegiance to the funk in every region where
The left hand's on the book (left hand's on the book, yeah)
We stick together like bird's of a feather
Cause we are family (family)
And ain't a damn thing changed
Except for just one new policy

There's no smoking in the house

[Outro Verse]
Because now there's children there
I just wanna pay my debts off without a bill to spare
Whether I'm a tax attorney of a giant billionaire
Or I practice taxidermy and my client killed a bear
I just don't have the will to care
And I always say I'll wait till tomorrow like I'm Silverchair
""Change, change, change"" my mind repeats
Sounding like a scratched vinyl record of an old Obama speech
One last record then I'll quit the touring life
Then I'll go and get domesticated with a boring wife
People say ""His career really took off when he stopped
Rapping and entered that chili cook-off""
He really took the golf nasty with a pitching wedge
[?]
The game ends and the fun fades
As I tell my lame friends about my son's grades
But one day it's back to the bottle
Fall off the wagon, horsepower, full throttle
'Cause living with sobriety's excruciating pain
And the thing I desire's a hallucinating brain
I'll even get a tribal doctor to vouch
Ayahuasca on the couch next to Oscar the Grouch
Enough Molly to probably convert my posture to slouch
I'll sit tight, shit right in a colostomy pouch
Senior citizen livin' off moonshine and pizza
Hookers at noontime, mainline Levitra
And when I finally develop emphysema
I'll buy a shotgun for permanent anesthesia
It won't matter, I'm an organ donor
Hunched over in the corner when the coroner comes over
And sees me covered in blood like a maniac's bib
After treating a baby like a baby back rib
As he looks around at my insanely wack crib
And it looks like a place where someone who smoked crack lived
He sees writings on the wall looking like mad libs
Nonsensical, rhymes parenthetical, ad-libs
And he sees the whole scene, it flashes
His mind rehashes where he [?]
Blood splashes
The coffee table glass crashes
But he ain't gonna see no ashes
No smoking in the house

177,You Could Take My Heart Away,"You could take my heart away tonight
You could take my heart away tonight
Come on, girl, reach into my life
Can keep what you want if you hold on tight
You could take my heart away tonight

You could be my dream machine tonight
You could be my dream machine tonight
You caught me turning out the light
Don't let me down, keep me up all night
You could take my heart away tonight

You could help me find my way
You could fill these empty days
You could take my heart away tonight, oh baby
If you should walk away I'll be all right
I could play it cool with all my might
I could fake it through this lonely life

You could take my heart away tonight, tonight
You could take my heart away tonight
Come on, girl, reach into my life
If not forever maybe once or twice
You could take my heart away
Let me know what part to play

178,Love On A Two Way Street,"I found love on a two way street
Lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
Lost it on a lonely highway

True love will never die
So I've been told, but now I must cry
It is finally goodbye, I know

With the music softly playing
His lips were gently saying
I love you

He held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation
And then he walked out

How could I be so blind
To give up love the very first time
To be fooled is a hurting pain
To be loved and fooled
Is a crying shame
While I bear the blame
As he laughs my name

With the music softly playing
His lips were gently saying
Honey, I love you
He held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation
And then he walked out

I found love on a two way street
Lost it on a lonely highway

He swept me off my feet
Ooo whee, you ought to come and see
How he walks
And how he talks

Ooo wah, ooo wah cool, cool kitty

He's really down
And he's no clown
He has the finest penthouse I've ever seen in town
And he's cute
In his mohair suit
And he keeps his pockets full of spending loot

His dueling scar
And brand new car

Every time he says he loves me
Chills run down my spine
Every time he wants to kiss me
He makes me feel so fine

Tell us about the boy from New York City

Well he can dance
(He can dance, take a chance with a little ro-)
And make romance

That's when I fell in love
With just one glance

On ways for you to love again

Sayin’ a premonition’s
Got you a-changin’ your mind
Boy, stop your reminiscin’

Every day you’re gone
Every day I move on
‘Cause it is plain to see
That you weren’t meant for me
‘Cause I…

You didn’t need me before
So why are you here begging?
Looks like you didn’t think of
Everything before letting
Me out of sight, ‘cause now you’re like
“Can I come around?”
Say you’re missin’ the sound
Of my everyday
You can stay away
‘Cause I…

They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train

To wear that ball and chain

182,I Don't Need You,"[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

[Verse 2]
I sing, ""I write my own tune and I write my own verse,"" hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man

[Verse 3]
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady

[Pre-Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough

[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all

My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning

[Verse 4]
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!

[Bridge]
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you

[Interlude]
Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea

[Verse 5]
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day

[Verse 6]
Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man

[Verse 7]
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu

Those times when even my friends
Tried to make a fool of me
There were things that my heart attacked
That they just couldn't see

Some said I was hopeless

Strong hearts just keep goin

Come together
Raise up your voices
This time my song of love and life won't go away
Ill sing forever
Here in the sunshine
I've lived to see the sun break through the storm
And I'm so glad I'm standing here today

If your lost in your troubles
And the world just seems to forget you
If you remember sunshine
Even on your darkest day
Just follow what your heart says
And you will find the way

Some said I was hopeless
........... tangled in the night
Strong hearts just keep goin
That is why I'm still standing here today

Come together

I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pajamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case

Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
The billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all, I know I will

I'm at the car park, the airport
The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding
Been wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion
It's no story I could tell
At my bedside, empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish it would stop

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

A fortune all for you
But it's not my conscience
That hates to be untrue

Tell me what is there to do?

When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you?

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you?
Oh, come on, you know me too well
And how can I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know I would never hurt you

What did you think
I would give at this moment?

And you know what I'm saying is true you're gonna break her up
And tear her down and fade her away
And then there's no telling what I'm gonna do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do

I'm gonna love her for both of us

I'm gonna give her everything you always wanted to give
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna take her every moment that she wanted to live

I'll let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is

I'll let her shine like a jewell in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is
Done

You gotta give me your girl and your trust
I'm gonna love her for both of us

And you'll never get it back and your holiness was never so pure
She needs a fire in the heart and not a stabbing in the back

You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is

You gotta give me your girl and your trust
I'm gonna love her for both of us

When the screws are tightnin' and the tears are falling
I can hear her crying out to be saved and like a bolt of lightning
I go answer the call but then
She's singing like a siren to me over the waves

I never wanted to take away your lover
Until I heard her cry out to be saved
I always thought of you as one of my brothers
But she's singing like a siren to me over the waves
Singing like a siren to me over the waves
There ain't no holding me down

I never thought that love would come back to me
When I closed my eyes and tried to dream
Darkness was the only thing I could see

Reached the end of the road
Hit the rocks at the bottom with no farther to go
But just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
You showed me there's more to this life

I can't believe I’m falling in love, but I am

I can't believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love once again

When you take my hand you hold my heart
And I know everything will be alright
When you touch me there I feel it everywhere
I'm loving things I never thought I would like

I can’t believe I’m falling in love, but I am

I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend

So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been

How could I ever forget?

It's no stranger to you and me

211,Time,"[Time]

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up the dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then, one day, you find, ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Breathe Reprise]

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells",Pink Floyd,1981,"[96, 84, 73, 53, 37, 15, 15, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, 38, 42, 44, 47, 56, 63, 73, 82]",23

218,Rock And Roll Dreams Come Through,"[Verse: Jim Steinman]
You can't run away forever
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start
You want to shut out the night, you want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'd lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid and you're completely amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do

[Chorus: Jim Steinman]
Keep on believing
And you'll discover baby:
There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really
Really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
The beat is yours forever
The beat is always new
And when you really
Really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through

It must be a madman's rainbow that I'm chasing

Yet you were the one that they said was so weird

When I was high as the sky

You say let's go home

233,Nothing Ever Goes As Planned,"[Verse 1]
What'cha gonna do when the sun goes down tonight
You'll hit the same old clubs, rap that same old trash
That's right
You've got them real silk shirts and them baggy pants
Dago shoes in the colors that match
But the girls are acting bored
And you're feeling like you're going to lose
You've got the g.q. blues

[Verse 2]
You get up every morning and you go to work each day
(you go to work, you go to work, you go to work)
Been doing the same damn job for ten long years this may
(you've got to work, you've got to work, you've got to work)
You've been working and saving for your jamaican dream
Paradise is waiting across the sea
But when your plane lands montego turns to monsoon
You've got the island blues

[Hook]
Cause, nothing ever goes as planned
It's a hell of a notion
Even pharaohs turn to sand
Like a drop in the ocean
You're so together and you act so civilized
But every time that things go wrong you're still surprised
You've done your duty, you've paid a fortune in dues
Still got those mother nature's blues

[Bridge]
I strut around the stage like a little king tonight
They'll scream for every word and every note, that's right
But when the show is over and I'm all alone
Can't reach my baby on the telephone
And everywhere I look mr. loneliness is in the news
I've got the big star blues

[Hook]
Boy, nothing ever goes as planned
It's a hell of a notion
Even pharaohs turn to sand
Like a drop in the ocean
I'm so together and I act so civilized
But every time that things go wrong
I'm still surprised
I've done my duty and paid a fortune in dues
Still got them mother nature's blues",Styx,1981,"[99, 93, 91, 54, 54, 62, 74, 85]",8
234,Medley,"I want you to bite my lip until I can no longer speak
And then suck my ex-girlfriend’s name out of my mouth just to make sure she never comes up in our conversations
I’m going to be honest, I’m not really a love poet
In fact, every time I try to write about love my hands cramp… just to show me how painful love can be
And sometimes my pencils break, just to prove to me that every now and then love takes a little more work than you planned
See I heard that love is blind so, I write all my poems in Braille
And my poems are never actually finished because true love is endless
I always believed that real love is kind of like a super model before she’s air brushed;
It’s pure and imperfect, just the way that God intended
See I’m going to be honest, I’m not a love poet
But if I was to wake up tomorrow morning and decide that I really wanted to write about love I swear that my first poem…
It would be about you

About how I loved you the same way that I learned how to ride a bike: Scared
But reckless with no training wheels or elbow pads so my scars can tell the story of how I fell for you
You see, I’m not really a love poet
But if I was I’d write about how I see your face in every cloud and your reflection in every window
You see I’ve written like a million poems hoping that somehow maybe someway you’ll jump out of the page and be closer to me
Because if you were here, right now
I would massage your back until your skin sings songs that your lips don’t even know the words to

Until your heartbeat sounds like my last name and you smile like the Pacific Ocean
I want to drink the sunlight in your skin
If I was a love poet
I’d write about how you have the audacity to be beautiful
Even on days when everything around you is ugly
You see I’d write about your eyelashes and how they are like violin strings that play symphonies every time you blink

If I was a love poet
I’d write about how I melt in front of you like an ice sculpture
Every time I hear the vibration in your voice so whenever I see your name on the caller ID my heart
It plays hopscotch inside of my chest
Yo it climbs onto my ribs like monkey bars and I feel like a child all over again
I know this sounds strange but every now and then I pray that God somehow turns you back in to one of my ribs...
Just so that I would never have to spend an entire day without you

I swear, I’m not a love poet
But if I was to wake up tomorrow morning and decide that I really wanted to write about love
My first poem it would be about you
And after all of that she was like, so how do you feel about me?
And I said, put it like this:
I want to be your ex boyfriend’s stunt man. I want to do everything that he never had the courage to do like… trust you

I swear that when our lips touch I can taste the next sixty years of my life
And some days I want to swallow stacks of your pictures just so you can be a part of me for a little bit longer
If I could I would sample your smile and then I would let my heart beat
Do the bass line, we would create the greatest love song of all time
Whenever, we stand next to each other, love I was the only one made for you and you can be at last my Etta James
I’ll be oh child when you’re in pain or you could be candy coated drops of rain
Even though it never rains in Southern California
And together, we could be music

And when my friends ask if you’re my girlfriend
I’ll say no
She is my musician
And me… I’m her favorite song",Rudy Francisco,1981,"[100, 100, 52, 44, 25, 12, 12, 7, 7, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 14, 21, 32, 48, 61, 76]",21
235,This Little Girl,"[Verse 1]
You got your keys, but where you going?
The third degree just isn't working
'Cause you walked out without asking me to go
And if I followed you home, would you be alone?
I checked your phone cause it was beeping
Are you alone? I know you're creeping
'Cause you walked out without asking me to go
But if I followed you home, I hope you're alone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm three steps from the edge
Don't push me over it
Don't you know, don't you know

[Chorus 1]
Every girl is capable of murder if you hurt her
Watch out, you, don't push me any further, any further
You're not the only one walking 'round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder 'cause you hurt her

[Verse 2]
My hands are clean, not yet a killer
Ain't I a queen? And did you tell her?
'Cause you broke down all my shoulda known betters
And I followed you home, throwing sticks and stones

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm two steps from the edge
Don't push me over it
Don't you know, don't you know

[Chorus 1]
Every girl is capable of murder if you hurt her
Watch out, you, don't push me any further, any further
You're not the only one walking 'round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder 'cause you hurt her

[Bridge]
Don't you know you should never treat a girl like that?
Got a good alibi, and my bags all packed
Don't you know you should never treat a girl like that?
'Cause the next one's gonna have the hammer pulled back

[Chorus 2]
Every girl is capable of murder
So watch out, you, don't push me any further
But you ******* hurt her
Every girl is capable of murder if you hurt her
Watch out, you, don't push me any further, any further
You're not the only one walking 'round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder, hey
This little girl is capable of murder 'cause you hurt her",Cady Groves,1981,"[90, 74, 52, 43, 30, 15, 12, 11, 11, 11, 12, 14, 17, 23, 25, 31, 40, 67]",18

You know, ladies and gentlemen
Very few performers have the privilege of singing with four marvelous ladies during the course of a career, or any other time for that matter
I consider myself very lucky privileged to perform with Mary Wells, Miss Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Miss Diana Ross, and Miss Tammi Terrell
Oh, she'd like that, she would, she'd like that, thank you
For her, I thank you too
So in order to perform these songs for you, a charming lady dancer is about to come to the stage to assist us
So won't you get together out there and welcome to the stage Miss Florence Lyles, ladies and gentlemen
Come on, Flo, baby
Thanks, baby
Yes, baby

Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see, you were my destiny
My arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life to you

[Pre-Chorus: Marvin & both]
Oh, I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by

Ooh
I've got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
Ooh, I read your letters you're not here
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no no

244,Pay You Back With Interest,"Too many people need me
I've got so much, so much to do
But when my travelling is over
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest

It seems unfair to leave you
And sell myself the way I do
But when my wandering is over
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest

Most of my life I've been moving
And when I tire, I'll come home to you
But until then I'll be waiting
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest

How cold is my room (How cold is my room?)
Without your love beside me?
We look at the same old moon (Looking at the moon)
But you're not here beside me
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest

Too many people need me
I've got so much, so much to do
But when my travelling is over
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest",The Hollies,1981,"[98, 70, 70, 80, 90]",5
245,Secrets,"[Verse 1]
Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want 'em too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

[Verse 2]
You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

[Bridge]
Wipe the...
Lies from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'",The Weeknd,1981,"[99, 76, 76, 79, 83, 87]",6
246,Sukiyaki,"[Verse]
It's all because of you I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely
Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears
I'm wishin' you were here with me
Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, oh, I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me, oh
If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me
Oh, baby, you took your love away from
Me

I would be a fool to lose the love I'd found
And if you take me back, I'll let you know

I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me

If you heard the whole thing before
Then once again, I'll tell you more
I would be a fool to ever let you go
Oh I had to go away to finally know
How much I need you back, I need your love

I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
I'll take you back, if you come back to me
Come back to me

If you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
I'll take you back
If you come back to me, come back to me

(Stronger, stronger) Stronger than before

Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (Stronger, stronger)
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me

I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (Stronger, stronger)

Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me

Come back to me, come back to me",Carole Bayer Sager,1981,"[92, 57, 38, 30, 30, 32, 34, 36, 40, 50, 63, 73, 83]",13
249,A Life Of Illusion,"Sometimes I can't help the feeling that I'm
Living a life of illusion
And oh, why can't we let it be
And see through the hole in this wall of confusion
I just can't help the feeling I'm
Living a life of illusion

Pow! Right between the eyes
Oh, how nature loves her little surprises
Wow! It all seems so logical now
It's just one of her better disguises
And it comes with no warning
Nature loves her little surprises
Continual crisis

Hey, don't you know it's a waste of your day
Caught up in endless solutions
That have no meaning, just another hunch
Based upon jumping conclusions

How much it breaks my heart

The sound of it almost gave me a heart attack
I bet if I said I would leave you, you wouldn't even care
If you saw me bawlin' tears, I bet you wouldn't even shed one (not one)
Do you even love me like you say I wonder?
Uh huh, damn that's fucked up
Lord please tell me why I love her
Girl I'll beg you for my heart back
Shouldn't have to go through all that

[Hook]
You'll do fine with just one
Why you gotta be so selfish?
Why you gotta be so selfish?
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna get what's mine back
Never mind that
You don't need two hearts
(You stole my heart, give it back to me)

[Verse 2]
So in love, I can't think straight
Please get the fuck out of my head baby
I wanna take a ride, where will I go?
My favorite places we created memories in those
I know you think my heart is fine but it isn't though
Your love, I need it here, physical
Do I gotta beg you for my heart back?
No, I shouldn't have to go through all that

You'll do fine with just one
Why you gotta be so selfish?
Why you gotta be so selfish?

[Verse 3]
Can I rap to you real quick?
I put what's left of my heart into this track
In hoping you'd feel it, damn
Real shit, it took a while to build this
And you still be talking that bullshit
Even though you not around, ventriloquist
You know better, that's off limits
Leave it alone before you break it
Maybe if you knew better, I might let you
But I know you won't hold it safely
Girl, you do know you got my heart
Please tell me what you need two for
To my health, girl, that's crucial
That's why I say I can't lose... you

266,Under The Covers,"[Verse 1]
Tiptoe
Down the hall from where you live
These floors are talkative
But it's alright, it's alright

So quiet
A little house out in the woods
And it would feel so good
If you would stay, if you would stay

[Chorus]
(Summer is over)
And I wanna leave you satisfied
(Summer is over)
And I can feel the cold changing us inside
(Come under the covers)
'Cause I wanna leave you satisfied tonight

In the low light
Two white shadows become one
Come on, put your moon in my sun
And set me on fire, set me on fire

And I wanna leave you satisfied

And I can feel the cold changing us inside
(Come under the covers)

It's like you grew up down the street
It's such a mystery
The way you know me, the way you know me

They just rearrange, the night and the new day
Gold exchanges for silver
And a light on a river gets carried away

[Chorus]
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

[Verse 2]
I lift up my head and I wonder
Just who it is calming, callin' my name now

My head fallin' under a blanket of shame

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

[Bridge]
High and low may I go
But God only knows just where I am going
High and low may I go
But God only knows just where I am going

[Verse 3]
The people around me won't let me
Become what I need to, they want me the same
I look at myself and I want to
Just cover my eyes and give myself a new name

[Verse 4]
The stones in the sky never worry
They don't have to hurry, they move in their own way
But I have to choose what to do
How to act, what to think, how to talk, what to say

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

Is it any wonder I'm sane at all?

Well, I'm so tired of losing- I got nothing to do

[Intro]
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
Come on Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada musta runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch – it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 2]
See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
‘Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out!
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water

We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear  (Mama!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free — whee! (woosh!)
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restrainin' order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her (Mommy!)

Telling me I had no choice

At least you know you tried to do it all

Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Some things in life are meant to be
Some changes set you free

And free means I can fly
And sometimes say goodbye
I wouldn't hold on if I could
Some changes are for good

Didn't you ever want to feel
Just the part of life that's real?
After all we're dealing with the truth here
Isn't it the truth we're going for?

And if somewhere along the line
Your dreams are lying close to mine
Maybe you and I could have it all
Maybe you and I could have it all

Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Somethings in life are meant to be
Some changes set you free

And free means I can fly
And sometimes say goodbye

It hurts to be in love
When the only one you love
Turns out to be someone who's
Not in love with you
It hurts to love her so
When deep down inside you know
She will never want you
No matter what you do
And so you cry a little bit

Ah, I die a little bit
(It hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way
How long can I exist
Wanting lips I've never kissed
She gives all her kisses
To somebody else
She thinks I'm just a friend
Though it hurts I must pretend
The only way to keep her
Is to keep it to myself

I can't bear with the things you put me through

But persuasive heart, you just won't let pure friendship be
You know our love couldn't last forever
Persuade your way, but you ain't clever
I close the door and I say never

Love elsewhere, for you I'm prayin'

I cannot be held responsible for blown behavior
I lost all contact with my only savior
No-one locked me out because I failed to phone up
I cannot bear to live forever like a loner

[Chorus]
Do not let go the coat

It is easy to be sad: when you lack a partner
But how would I react to a broken heart now
It is not really true rock and roll unless I am
Hanging onto you and when I hold it next time

[Chorus]
I will not let go the coat

[Verse 3]
I try to explain but you never understand it
I need your body but I cannot just demand it
I will not let go like a stray at heel
(Never let it out of your sight)
Every lonely wife knows the way I feel

[Chorus]
(Do not let go tonight)
Do not let go the coat
Never let go the coat

[Verse 4]
Your friends all pass for life is just a market
But you have to finish everything you started
So I live my life tearing down the runway
Sure to get the hang of hanging in there someday

284,What She Does To Me (The Diana Song),"Dogs Of The Hospital Of The Resurrection In The City Of Valladolid, Commonly Called The Dogs Of Mahudes

SCIP
Berganza, my friend, let us leave our watch over the hospital to-night, and retire to this lonely place and these mats, where, without being noticed, we may enjoy that unexampled favour which heaven has bestowed on us both at the same moment.

BERG
Brother Scipio, I hear you speak, and know that I am speaking to you; yet cannot I believe, so much does it seem to me to pass the bounds of nature.

SCIP
That is true, Berganza; and what makes the miracle greater is, that we not only speak but hold intelligent discourse, as though we had souls capable of reason; whereas we are so far from having it, that the difference between brutes and man consists in this, that man is a rational animal and the brute is irrational.

BERG
I hear all you say, Scipio; and that you say it, and that I hear it, causes me fresh admiration and wonder. It is very true that in the course of my life I have many a time heard tell of our great endowments, insomuch that some, it appears, have been disposed to think that we possess a natural instinct, so vivid and acute in many things that it gives signs and tokens little short of demonstrating that we have a certain sort of understanding capable of reason.

SCIP
What I have heard highly extolled is our strong memory, our gratitude, and great fidelity; so that it is usual to depict us as symbols of friendship. Thus you will have seen (if it has ever come under your notice) that, on the alabaster tombs, on which are represented the figures of those interred in them, when they are husband and wife, a figure of a dog is placed between the pair at their feet, in token that in life their affection and fidelity to each other was inviolable,

BERG
I know that there have been grateful dogs who have cast themselves into the same grave with the bodies of their deceased masters; others have stood over the graves in which their lords were buried without quitting them or taking food till they died. I know, likewise, that next to the elephant the dog holds the first place in the way of appearing to possess understanding, then the horse, and last the ape.

SCIP
True; but you will surely confess that you never saw or heard tell of any elephant, dog, horse, or monkey having talked: hence I infer, that this fact of our coming by the gift of speech so unexpectedly falls within the list of those things which are called portents, the appearance of which indicates, as experience testifies, that some great calamity threatens the nations.

BERG
That being so I can readily enough set down as a portentous token what I heard a student say the other day as I passed through Alcala de Henares.

SCIP
What was that?

BERG
That of five thousand students this year attending the university—two thousand are studying medicine.

SCIP
And what do you infer from that?

BERG
I infer either that those two thousand doctors will have patients to treat, and that would be a woful thing, or that they must die of hunger.

SCIP
Be that as it may, let us talk, portent or no portent; for what heaven has ordained to happen, no human diligence or wit can prevent. Nor is it needful that we should fall to disputing as to the how or the why we talk. Better will it be to make the best of this good clay or good night at home; and since we enjoy it so much on these mats, and know not how long this good fortune of ours may last, let us take advantage of it and talk all night, without suffering sleep to deprive us of a pleasure which I, for my part, have so long desired.

BERG
And I, too; for ever since I had strength enough to gnaw a bone I have longed for the power of speech, that I might utter a multitude of things I had laid up in my memory, and which lay there so long that they were growing musty or almost forgotten. Now, however, that I see myself so unexpectedly enriched with this divine gift of speech, I intend to enjoy it and avail myself of it as much as I can, taking pains to say everything I can recollect, though it be confusedly and helter-skelter, not knowing when this blessing, which I regard as a loan, shall be reclaimed from me.

SCIP
Let us proceed in this manner, friend Berganza: to-night you shall relate the history of your life to me, and the perils through which you have passed to the present hour; and to-morrow night, if we still have speech, I will recount mine to you; for it will be better to spend the time in narrating our own lives than in trying to know those of others.

BERG
I have ever looked upon you, Scipio, as a discreet dog and a friend, and now I do so more than ever, since, as a friend, you desire to tell me your adventures and know mine; and, as a discreet dog, you apportion the time in which we may narrate them. But first observe whether any one overhears us.

SCIP
No one, I believe; since hereabouts there is a soldier going through a sweating-course; but at this time of night he will be more disposed to sleep than to listen to anything.

BERG
Since then we can speak so securely, hearken; and if I tire you with what I say, either check me or bid me hold my tongue.

SCIP
Talk till dawn, or till we are heard, and I will listen to you with very great pleasure, without interrupting you, unless I see it to be necessary.

BERG
It appears to me that the first time I saw the sun was in Seville, in its slaughter-houses, which were outside the Puerta do la Carne; wence I should imagine (were it not for what I shall afterwards tell you) that my progenitors were some of those mastiff's which are bred by those ministers of confusion who are called butchers. The first I knew for a master, was one Nicholas the Pugnosed, a stout, thick-set, passionate fellow, as all butchers are. This Nicholas taught me and other whelps to run at bulls in company with old dogs and catch them by the ears. With great ease I became an eagle among my fellows in this respect.

SCIP
I do not wonder, Berganza, that ill-doing is so easily learned, since it comes by a natural obliquity.

BERG
What can I say to you, brother Scipio, of what I saw in those slaughter-houses, and the enormous things that were done in them? In the first place, you must understand that all who work in them, from the lowest to the highest, are people without conscience or humanity, fearing neither the king nor his justice; most of them living in concubinage; carrion birds of prey; maintaining themselves and their doxies by what they steal. On all flesh days, a great number of wenches and young chaps assemble in the slaughtering place before dawn, all of them with bags which come empty and go away full of pieces of meat. Not a beast is killed out of which these people do not take tithes, and that of the choicest and most savoury pickings. The masters trust implicitly in these honest folk, not with the hope that they will not rob them (for that is impossible), but that they may use their knives with some moderation. But what struck me as the worst thing of all, was that these butchers make no more of killing a man than a cow. They will quarrel for straws, and stick a knife into a person's body as readily as they would fell an ox. It is a rare thing for a day to pass without brawls and bloodshed, and even murder. They all pique themselves on being men of mettle, and they observe, too, some punctilios of the bravo; there is not one of them but has his guardian angel in the Plaza de San Francesco, whom he propitiates with sirloins, and beef tongues.

SCIP
If you mean to dwell at such length, friend Berganza, on the characteristics and faults of all the masters you have had, we had better pray to heaven to grant us the gift of speech for a year; and even then I fear, at the rate you are going, you will not get through half your story. One thing I beg to remark to you, of which you will see proof when I relate my own adventures; and that is, that some stories are pleasing in themselves, and others from the manner in which they are told; I mean that there are some which give satisfaction, though they are told without preambles and verbal adornments; while others require to be decked in that way and set off by expressive play of features, hands, and voice; whereby, instead of flat and insipid, they become pointed and agreeable. Do not forget this hint, but profit by it in what you are about to say.

BERG
I will do so, if I can, and if I am not hindered by the great temptation I feel to speak; though, indeed, it appears to me that I shall have the greatest difficulty in constraining myself to moderation.

SCIP
Be wary with your tongue, for from that member flow the greatest ills of human life.

BERG
Well, then, to go on with my story, my master taught me to carry a basket in my mouth, and to defend it against any one who should attempt to take it from me. He also made me acquainted with the house in which his mistress lived, and thereby spared her servant the trouble of coming to the slaughter-house, for I used to carry to her the pieces of meat he had stolen over night. Once as I was going along on this errand in the gray of the morning, I heard some one calling me by name from a window. Looking up I saw an extremely pretty girl; she came down to the street door, and began to call me again. I went up to her to see what she wanted of me; and what was it but to take away the meat I was carrying in the basket and put an old clog in its place? ""Be off with you,"" she said, when she had done so; ""and tell Nicholas the Pugnosed, your master, not to put trust in brutes."" I might easily have made her give up what she had taken from me; but I would not put a cruel tooth on those delicate white hands.

SCIP
You did quite right; for it is the prerogative of beauty always to be held in respect.

BERG
Well, I went back to my master without the meat and with the old clog. It struck him that I had come back very soon, and seeing the clog, he guessed the trick, snatched up a knife, and flung it at me; and if I had not leaped aside, you would not now be listening to my story. I took to my heels, and was off like a shot behind St. Bernard's, away over the fields, without stopping to think whither my luck would lead me. That night I slept under the open sky, and the following day I chanced to fall in with a flock of sheep. The moment I saw it, I felt that I had found the very thing that suited me, since it appeared to me to be the natural and proper duty of dogs to guard the fold, that being an office which involves the great virtue of protecting and defending the lowly and the weak against the proud and mighty. One of the three shepherds who were with the flock immediately called me to him, and I, who desired nothing better, went up at once to him, lowering my head and wagging my tail. He passed his hand along my back, opened my mouth, examined my fangs, ascertained my age, and told his master that I had all the works and tokens of a dog of good breed. Just then up came the owner of the flock on a gray mare with lance and surge, so that he looked more a coast-guard than a sheep master.

""What dog is that!"" said he to the shepherd; ""he seems a good one."" ""You may well say that,"" replied the man; ""for I have examined him closely, and there is not a mark about him but shows that he must be of the right sort. He came here just now; I don't know whose he is, but I know that he does not belong to any of the flocks hereabouts.""

""If that be so,"" said the master, ""put on him the collar that belonged to the dog that is dead, and give him the same rations as the rest, treat him kindly that he may take a liking to the fold, and remain with it henceforth."" So saying he went away, and the shepherd put on my neck a collar set with steel points, after first giving me a great mess of bread sopped in milk in a trough. At the same time I had a name bestowed on me, which was Barcino. I liked my second master, and my new duty very well; I was careful and diligent in watching the flock, and never quitted it except in the afternoons, when I went to repose under the shade of some tree, or rock, or bank, or by the margin of one of the many streams that watered the country. Nor did I spend those leisure hours idly, but employed them in calling many things to mind, especially the life I had led in the slaughter-house, and also that of my master and all his fellows, who were bound to satisfy the inordinate humours of their mistresses. O how many things I could tell you of that I learned in the school of that she-butcher, my master's lady; but I must pass them over, lest you should think me tedious and censorious.

SCIP
I have heard that it was a saying of a great poet among the ancients, that it was a difficult thing to write satires. I consent that you put some point into your remarks, but not to the drawing of blood. You may hit lightly, but not wound or kill; for sarcasm, though it make many laugh, is not good if it mortally wounds one; and if you can please without it, I shall think you more discreet.

BERG
I will take your advice, and I earnestly long for the time when you will relate your own adventures; for seeing how judiciously you correct the faults into which I fall in my narrative, I may well expect that your own will be delivered in a manner equally instructive and delightful. But to take up the broken thread of my story, I say that in those hours of silence and solitude, it occurred to me among other things, that there could be no truth in what I had heard tell of the life of shepherds—of those, at least, about whom my master's lady used to read, when I went to her house, in certain books, all treating of shepherds and shepherdesses; and telling how they passed their whole life in singing and playing on pipes and rebecks, and other old fashioned instruments. I remember her reading how the shepherd of Anfriso sang the praises of the peerless Belisarda, and that there was not a tree on all the mountains of Arcadia on whose trunk he had not sat and sung from the moment Sol quitted the arms of Aurora, till he threw himself into those of Thetis, and that even after black night had spread its murky wings over the face of the earth, he did not cease his melodious complaints. I did not forget the shepherd Elicio, more enamoured than bold, of whom it was said, that without attending to his own loves or his flock, he entered into others' griefs; nor the great shepherd Filida, unique painter of a single portrait, who was more faithful than happy; nor the anguish of Sireno and the remorse of Diana, and how she thanked God and the sage Felicia, who, with her enchanted water, undid that maze of entanglements and difficulties. I bethought me of many other tales of the same sort, but they were not worthy of being remembered.

The habits and occupations of my masters, and the rest of the shepherds in that quarter, were very different from those of the shepherds in the books. If mine sang, it was no tuneful and finely composed strains, but very rude and vulgar songs, to the accompaniment not of pipes and rebecks, but to that of one crook knocked against another, or of bits of tile jingled between the fingers, and sung with voices not melodious and tender, but so coarse and out of tune, that whether singly or in chorus, they seemed to be howling or grunting. They passed the greater part of the day in hunting up their fleas or mending their brogues; and none of them were named Amarillis, Filida, Galatea, or Diana; nor were there any Lisardos, Lausos, Jacintos, or Riselos; but all were Antones, Domingos, Pablos, or Llorentes. This led me to conclude that all those books about pastoral life are only fictions ingeniously written for the amusement of the idle, and that there is not a word of truth in them; for, were it otherwise, there would have remained among my shepherds some trace of that happy life of yore, with its pleasant meads, spacious groves, sacred mountains, handsome gardens, clear streams and crystal fountains, its ardent but no less decorous love-descants, with here the shepherd, there the shepherdess all woe-begone, and the air made vocal everywhere with flutes and pipes and flageolets.

SCIP
Enough, Berganza; get back into your road, and trot on.

BERG
I am much obliged to you, friend Scipio; for, but for your hint, I was getting so warm upon the scent, that I should not have stopped till I had given you one whole specimen of those books that had so deceived me. But a time will come when I shall discuss the whole matter more fully and more opportunely than now.

SCIP
Look to your feet, and don't run after your tail, that is to say, recollect that you are an animal devoid of reason; or if you seem at present to have a little of it, we are already agreed that this is a supernatural and altogether unparalleled circumstance.

BERG
That would be all very well if I were still in my pristine state of ignorance; but now that I bethink me of what I should have mentioned to you in the beginning of our conversation, I not only cease to wonder that I speak, but I am terrified at the thought of leaving off.

SCIP
Can you not tell me that something now that you recollect it?

BERG
It was a certain affair that occurred to me with a sorntess, a disciple of la Camacha de Montilla.

SCIP
Let me hear it now, before you proceed with the story of your life.

BERG
No, not till the proper time. Have patience and listen to the recital of my adventures in the order they occurred, for they will afford you more pleasure in that way.

SCIP
Very well; tell me what you will and how you will, but be brief.

BERG
I say, then, that I was pleased with my duty as a guardian of the flock, for it seemed to me that in that way I ate the bread of industry, and that sloth, the root and mother of all vices, came not nigh me; for if I rested by day, I never slept at night, the wolves continually assailing us and calling us to arms. The instant the shepherds said to me, ""The wolf! the wolf! at him, Barcino,"" I dashed forward before all the other dogs, in the direction pointed out to me by the shepherds. I scoured the valleys, searched the mountains, beat the thickets, leaped the gullies, crossed the roads, and on the morning returned to the fold without having caught the wolf or seen a glimpse of him, panting, weary, all scratched and torn, and my feet cut with splinters; and I found in the fold either a ewe or a wether slaughtered and half eaten by the wolf. It vexed me desperately to see of what little avail were all my care and diligence. Then the owner of the flock would come; the shepherds would go out to meet him with the skin of the slaughtered animal: the owner would scold the shepherds for their negligence, and order the dogs to be punished for cowardice. Down would come upon us a shower of sticks and revilings; and so, finding myself punished without fault, and that my care, alertness, and courage were of no avail to keep off the wolf, I resolved to change my manner of proceeding, and not to go out to seek him, as I had been used to do, but to remain close to the fold; for since the wolf came to it, that would be the surest place to catch him. Every week we had an alarm; and one dark night I contrived to get a sight of the wolves, from which it was so impossible to guard the fold. I crouched behind a bank; the rest of the dogs ran forward; and from my lurking-place I saw and heard how two shepherds picked out one of the fattest wethers, and slaughtered it in such a manner, that it really appeared next morning as if the executioner had been a wolf. I was horror-struck, when I saw that the shepherds themselves were the wolves, and that the flock was plundered by the very men who had the keeping of it. As usual, they made known to their master the mischief done by the wolf, gave him the skin and part of the carcase, and ate the rest, and that the choicest part, themselves. As usual, they had a scolding, and the dogs a beating. Thus there were no wolves, yet the flock dwindled away, and I was dumb, all which filled me with amazement and anguish. O Lord! said I to myself, who can ever remedy this villany? Who will have the power to make known that the defence is offensive, the sentinels sleep, the trustees rob, and those who guard you kill you?

SCIP
You say very true, Berganza; for there is no worse or more subtle thief than the domestic thief; and accordingly there die many more of those who are trustful than of those who are wary. But the misfortune is, that it is impossible for people to get on in the world in any tolerable way without mutual confidence. However, let us drop this subject: there is no need that we should be evermore preaching. Go on.

BERG
I determined then to quit that service, though it seemed so good a one, and to choose another, in which well-doing, if not rewarded, was at least not punished. I went back to Seville, and entered the service of a very rich merchant.

SCIP
How did you set about getting yourself a master? As things are now-a-days, an honest man has great difficulty in finding an employer. Very different are the lords of the earth from the Lord of Heaven; the former, before they will accept a servant, first scrutinise his birth and parentage, examine into his qualifications, and even require to know what clothes he has got; but for entering the service of God, the poorest is the richest, the humblest is the best born; and whoso is but disposed to serve him in purity of heart is at once entered in his book of wages, and has such assigned to him as his utmost desire can hardly compass, so ample are they.

BERG
All this is preaching, Scipio.

SCIP
Well, it strikes me that it is. So go on.

BERG
With respect to your question, how I set about getting a master: you are aware that humility is the base and foundation of all virtues, and that without it there are none. It smooths inconveniences, overcomes difficulties, and is a means which always conducts us to glorious ends; it makes friends of enemies, tempers the wrath of the choleric, and abates the arrogance of the proud: it is the mother of modesty, and sister of temperance. I availed myself of this virtue whenever I wanted to get a place in any house, after having first considered and carefully ascertained that it was one which could maintain a great dog. I then placed myself near the door; and whenever any one entered whom I guessed to be a stranger, I barked at him; and when the master entered, I went up to him with my head down, my tail wagging, and licked his shoes. If they drove me out with sticks, I took it patiently, and turned with the same gentleness to fawn in the same way on the person who beat me. The rest let me alone, seeing my perseverance and my generous behaviour; and after one or two turns of this kind, I got a footing in the house. I was a good servant: they took a liking to me immediately; and I was never turned out, but dismissed myself, or, to speak more properly, I ran away; and sometimes I met with such a master, that but for the persecution of fortune I should have remained with him to this day.

SCIP
It was just in the same way that I got into the houses of the masters I served. It seems that we read men's thoughts.

BERG
I will tell you now what happened to me after I left the fold in the power of those reprobates. I returned, as I have said, to Seville, the asylum of the poor and refuge for the destitute, which embraces in its greatness not only the rude but the mighty and nourishing. I planted myself at the door of a large house belonging to a merchant, exerted myself as usual, and after a few trials gained admission. They kept me tied up behind the door by day, and let me loose at night. I did my duty with great care and diligence, barked at strangers, and growled at those who were not well known. I did not sleep at night, but visited the yards, and walked about the terraces, acting as general guard over our own house and those of the neighbours; and my master was so pleased with my good service, that he gave orders I should be well treated, and have a ration of bread, with the bones from his table, and the kitchen scraps. For this I showed my gratitude by no end of leaps when I saw my master, especially when he came home after being abroad; and such were my demonstrations of joy that my master ordered me to be untied, and left loose day and night. As soon as I was set free, I ran to him, and gambolled all round him, without venturing to lay my paws on him; for I bethought me of that ass in Æsop's Fables, who was ass enough to think of fondling his master in the same manner as his favourite lap-dog, and was well basted for his pains. I understood that fable to signify, that what is graceful and comely in some is not so in others. Let the ribald flout and jeer, the mountebank tumble,—let the common fellow, who has made it his business, imitate the song of birds and the gestures of animals, but not the man of quality, who can deserve no credit or renown from any skill in these things.

SCIP
Enough said, Berganza; I understand you; go on.

BERG
Would that others for whom I say this understood me as well! For there is something or other in my nature which makes me feel greatly shocked when I see a cavalier make a buffoon of himself, and taking pride in being able to play at thimblerig, and in dancing the chacona to perfection, I know a cavalier who boasted, that he had, at the request of a sacristan, cut out thirty-two paper ornaments, to stick upon the black cloth over a monument; and he was so proud of his performance that he took his friends to see it, as though he were showing them pennons and trophies taken from the enemy, and hung over the tombs of his forefathers. Well, this merchant I have been telling you of had two sons, one aged twelve, the other about fourteen, who were studying the humanities in the classes of the Company of Jesus. They went in pomp to the college, accompanied by their tutor, and by pages to carry their books, and what they called their Vademecum. To see them go with such parade, on horseback in fine weather, and in a carriage when it rained, made me wonder at the plain manner in which their father went abroad upon his business, attended by no other servant than a negro, and sometimes mounted upon a sorry mule.

SCIP
You must know, Berganza, that it is a customary thing with the merchants of Seville, and of other cities also, to display their wealth and importance, not in their own persons, but in those of their sons: for merchants are greater in their shadows than in themselves; and as they rarely attend to anything else than their bargains, they spend little on themselves; but as ambition and wealth burn to display themselves, they show their own in the persons of their sons, maintaining them as sumptuously as if they were sons of princes. Sometimes too they purchase titles for them, and set upon their breasts the mark that so much distinguishes men of rank from the commonalty.

BERG
It is ambition, but a generous ambition that seeks to improve one's condition without prejudice to others.

SCIP
Seldom or never can ambition consist with abstinence from injury to others.

BERG
Have we not said that we are not to speak evil of any one?

SCIP
Ay, but I don't speak evil of any one.

BERG
You now convince me of the truth of what I have often heard say, that a person of a malicious tongue will utter enough to blast ten families, and calumniate twenty good men; and if he is taken to task for it, he will reply that he said nothing; or, if he did, he meant nothing by it, and would not have said it if he had thought any one would take it amiss. In truth, Scipio, one had need of much wisdom and wariness to be able to entertain a conversation for two hours, without approaching the confines of evil speaking. In my own case, for instance, brute as I am, I see that with every fourth phrase I utter, words full of malice and detraction come to my tongue like flies to wine. I therefore say again that doing and speaking evil are things we inherit from our first parents, and suck in with our mother's milk. This is manifest in the fact, that hardly is a boy out of swaddling clothes before he lifts his hand to take vengeance upon those by whom he thinks himself offended; and the first words he articulates are to call his nurse or his mother a jade.

SCIP
That is true. I confess my error, and beg you will forgive it, as I have forgiven you so many. Let us pitch ill-nature into the sea—as the boys say—and henceforth backbite no more. Go on with your story. You were talking of the grand style in which the sons of your master the merchant went to the college of the Company of Jesus.

BERG
I will go on then; and though I hold it a sufficient thing to abstain from ill-natured remarks, yet I propose to use a remedy, which I am told was employed by a great swearer, who repenting of his bad habit, made it a practice to pinch his arm, or kiss the ground as penance, whenever an oath escaped him; but he continued to swear for all that. In like manner, whenever I act contrary to the precept you have given me against evil speaking, and contrary to my own intention to abstain from that practice, I will bite the tip of my tongue, so that the smart may remind me of my fault, and hinder me from relapsing into it.

SCIP
If that is the remedy you mean to use, I expect that you will have to bite your tongue so often, that there will be none of it left, and it will be put beyond the possibility of offending.

BERG
At least I will do my best; may heaven make up my deficiencies. Well, to resume: one day my master's sons left a note-book in the court-yard where I was; and as I had been taught to fetch and carry, I took it up, and went after them, resolved to put it into their own hands. It turned out exactly as I desired; for my masters seeing me coming with the note-book in my mouth, which I held cleverly by its string, sent a page to take it from me; but I would not let him, nor quitted it till I entered the hall with it, at which all the students fell a laughing. Going up to the elder of my masters, I put it into his hands, with all the obsequiousness I could, and went and seated myself on my haunches at the door of the hall, with my eyes fixed on the master who was lecturing in the chair. There is some strange charm in virtue; for though I know little or nothing about it, I at once took delight in seeing the loving care and industry with which the reverend fathers taught those youths, shaping their tender minds aright, and guiding them in the path of virtue, which they demonstrated to them along with letters. I observed how they reproved them with suavity, chastised them with mercy, animated them with examples, incited them with rewards, and indulged them with prudence; and how they set before them the loathsomeness of vice and the beauty of virtue, so that abhorring the one and loving the other, they might achieve the end for which they were created.

SCIP
You say very well, Berganza; for I have heard tell of this holy fraternity, that for worldly wisdom there are none equal to them; and that as guides and leaders on the road to heaven, few come up to them. They are mirrors of integrity, catholic doctrine, rare wisdom, and profound humility, the base on which is erected the whole edifice of beatitude.

BERG
That is every word true. But to return to my story: my masters were so pleased with my carrying them the note-book, that they would have me do so every day; and thus I enjoyed the life of a king, or even better, having nothing to do but to play with the students, with whom I grew so tame, that they would put their hands in my mouth, and the smallest of them would ride on my back. They would fling their hats or caps for me to fetch, and I would put them into their hands with marks of great delight. They used to give me as much to eat as they could; and they were fond of seeing, when they gave me nuts or almonds, how I cracked them like a monkey, let fall the shells, and ate the kernels. One student, to make proof of my ability, brought me a great quantity of salad in a basket, and I ate it like a human being. It was the winter season, when manchets and mantequillas abound in Seville; and I was so well supplied with them, that many an Antonio was pawned or sold that I might breakfast. In short, I spent a student's life, without hunger or itch, and that is saying everything for it; for if hunger and itch were not identified with the student's life, there would be none more agreeable in the world; since virtue and pleasure go hand in hand through it, and it is passed in learning and taking diversion. This happy life ended too soon for me. It appeared to the professors that the students spent the half-hour between the classes not in studying their lessons, but in playing with me; and therefore they ordered my masters not to bring me any more to the college. I was left at home accordingly, at my old post behind the door; and notwithstanding the order graciously given by the head of the family, that I should be at liberty day and night, I was again confined to a small mat, with a chain round my neck. Ah, friend Scipio, did you but know how sore a thing it is to pass from a state of happiness to one of wretchedness! When sorrows and distresses flood the whole course of life, either they soon end in death, or their continuance begets a habit of endurance, which generally alleviates their greatest rigour; but when one passes suddenly and unexpectedly from a miserable and calamitous lot to one of prosperity and enjoyment, and soon after relapses into his former state of woe and suffering: this is such a poignant affliction, that if it does not extinguish life, it is only to make it a prolonged torment. Well, I returned to my ordinary rations, and to the bones which were flung to me by a negress belonging to the house; but even these were partly filched from me by two cats, who very nimbly snapped up whatever fell beyond the range of my chain. Brother Scipio, as you hope that heaven will prosper all your desires, do suffer me to philosophise a little at present; for unless I utter the reflections which have now occurred to my mind, I feel that my story will not be complete or duly edifying.

SCIP
Beware, Berganza, that this inclination to philosophise is not a temptation of the fiend; for slander has no better cloak to conceal its malice than the pretence that all it utters are maxims of philosophers, that evil speaking is moral reproval, and the exposure of the faults of others is nothing but honest zeal. There is no sarcastic person whose life, if you scrutinise it closely, will not be found full of vices and improprieties. And now, after this warning, philosophise as much as you have a mind.

BERG
You may be quite at your ease on that score, Scipio. What I have to remark is, that as I was the whole day at leisure—and leisure is the mother of reflection—I conned over several of those Latin phrases I had heard when I was with my masters at college, and wherewith it seemed to me that I had somewhat improved my mind; and I determined to make use of them as occasion should arise, as if I knew how to talk, but in a different manner from that practised by some ignorant persons, who interlard their conversation with Latin apophthegms, giving those who do not understand them to believe that they are great Latinists, whereas they can hardly decline a noun or conjugate a verb.

SCIP
That is not so bad as what is done by some who really understand Latin; some of whom are so absurd, that in talking with a shoemaker or a tailor, they pour out Latin like water.

BERG
On the whole we may conclude, that he who talks Latin before persons who do not understand it, and he who talks it, being himself ignorant of it, are both equally to blame.

SCIP
Another thing you may remark, which is that some persons who know Latin are not the less asses for all that.

BERG
No doubt of it; and the reason is clear; for when in the time of the Romans everybody spoke Latin as his mother tongue, that did not hinder some among them from being boobies.

SCIP
But to know when to keep silence in the mother tongue, and speak in Latin, is a thing that needs discretion, brother Berganza.

BERG
True; for a foolish word may be spoken in Latin as well as in the vulgar tongue; and I have seen silly literati, tedious pedants, and babblers in the vernacular, who were enough to plague one to death with their scraps of Latin.

SCIP
No more of this: proceed to your philosophical remarks.

BERG
They are already delivered.

SCIP
How so?

BERG
In those remarks on Latin and the vulgar tongue, which I began and you finished.

SCIP
Do you call railing philosophising? Sanctify the unhallowed plague of evil speaking, Berganza, and give it any name you please, it will, nevertheless entail upon us the name of cynics, which means dogs of ill tongue. In God's name, hold your peace, and go on with your story.

BERG
How can I go on with my story, if I hold my peace?

SCIP
I mean go on with it in one piece, and don't hang on so many tails to it as to make it look like a polypus.

BERG
Speak correctly, Scipio: one does not say the tails but the arms of a polypus. But to my story: my evil fortune, not content with having torn me from my studies, and from the calm and joyous life I led amid them; not content with having fastened me up behind a door, and transferred me from the liberality of the students to the stinginess of the negress, resolved to rob me of the little ease and comfort I still enjoyed. Look ye, Scipio, you may set it down with me for a certain fact, that ill luck will hunt out and find the unlucky one, though he hides in the uttermost parts of the earth. I have reason to say this; for the negress was in love with a negro, also belonging to the house, who slept in the porch between the street-door and the inner one behind which I was fastened, and they could only meet at night, to which end they had stolen the keys or got false ones. Every night the negress came down stairs, and stopping my mouth with a piece of meat or cheese, opened the door for the negro. For some days, the woman's bribes kept my conscience asleep; for but for them, I began to fear that my ribs would come together, and that I should be changed from a mastiff to a greyhound. But my better nature coming at last to my aid, I bethought me of what was due to my master, whose bread I ate; and that I ought to act as becomes not only honest dogs, but all who have masters to serve.

SCIP
There now, Berganza, you have spoken what I call true philosophy; but go on. Do not make too long a yarn—not to say tail of your history.

BERG
But, first of all, pray tell me if you know what is the meaning of the word philosophy? For though I use it, I do not know what the thing really is, only I guess that it is something good.

SCIP
I will tell you briefly. The word is compounded of two Greek words, philo, love, and sophia, wisdom; so that it means love of wisdom, and philosopher a lover of wisdom.

BERG
What a deal you know, Scipio. Who the deuce taught you Greek words?

SCIP
Truly you are a simpleton, Berganza, to make so much of a matter that is known to every schoolboy; indeed, there are many persons who pretend to know Greek, though they are ignorant of it, just as is the case with Latin.

BERG
I believe it, Scipio; and I would have such persons put under a press, as the Portuguese do with the negroes of Guinea, and have all the juice of their knowledge well squeezed out of them, so that they might no more cheat the world with their scraps of broken Greek and Latin.

SCIP
Now indeed, Berganza, you may bite your tongue, and I may do the same; for we do nothing but rail in every word.

BERG
Ay, but I am not bound to do as I have heard that one Charondas, a Tyrian, did, who published a law that no one should enter the national assembly in arms, on pain of death. Forgetting this, he one day entered the assembly girt with a sword; the fact was pointed out to him, and, on the instant, he drew his sword, plunged it into his body, and thus he was the first who made the law, broke it, and suffered its penalty. But I made no law; all I did was to promise that I would bite my tongue, if I chanced to utter an acrimonious word; but things are not so strictly managed in these times as in those of the ancients. To-day a law is made, and to-morrow it is broken, and perhaps it is fit it should be so. To-day a man promises to abandon his fault, and to-morrow he falls into a greater. It is one thing to extol discipline, and another to inflict it on one's self; and indeed there is a wide difference between saying and doing. The devil may bite himself, not I; nor have I a mind to perform heroic acts of self-denial here on this mat, where there are no witnesses to commend my honourable determination.

SCIP
In that case, Berganza, were you a man you would be a hypocrite, and all your acts would be fictitious and false, though covered with the cloak of virtue, and done only that men might praise you, like the acts of all hypocrites.

BERG
I don't know what I should do if I were a man; but what I do know is that at present I shall not bite my tongue, having so many things yet to tell, and not knowing how or when I shall be able to finish them; but rather fearing that when the sun rises we shall be left groping without the power of speech.

SCIP
Heaven forbid it! Go on with your story, and do not run off the road into needless digressions; in that way only you will come soon to the end of it, however long it may be.

BERG
I say, then, that having seen the thievery, impudence, and shameful conduct of the negroes, I determined, like a good servant, to put an end to their doings, if possible, and I succeeded completely in my purpose. The negress, as I have told you, used to come to amuse herself with the negro, making sure of my silence on account of the pieces of meat, bread, or cheese she threw me. Gifts have much power, Scipio.

SCIP
Much. Don't digress: go on.

BERG
I remember, when I was a student, to have heard from the master a Latin phrase or adage, as they call it, which ran thus: habet bovem in lingua.

SCIP
O confound your Latin! Have you so soon forgotten what we have said of those who mix up that language with ordinary conversation?

BERG
But this bit of Latin comes in here quite pat; for you must know that the Athenians had among their coin one which was stamped with the figure of an ox; and whenever a judge failed to do justice in consequence of having been corrupted, they used to say, ""He has the ox on his tongue.""

SCIP
I do not see the application.

BERG
Is it not very manifest, since I was rendered mute many times by the negress's gifts, and was careful not to bark when she came down to meet her amorous negro? Wherefore I repeat, that great is the power of gifts.

SCIP
I have already admitted it; and were it not to avoid too long a digression, I could adduce many instances in point; but I will speak of these another time, if heaven grants me an opportunity of narrating my life to you.

BERG
God grant it! meanwhile I continue. At last my natural integrity prevailed over the negress's bribes; and one very dark night, when she came down as usual, I seized her without barking, in order not to alarm the household; and in a trice I tore her shift all to pieces, and bit a piece out of her thigh. This little joke confined her for eight days to her bed, for which she accounted to her masters by some pretended illness or other. When she was recovered, she came down another night: I attacked her again; and without biting, scratched her all over as if I had been carding wool. Our battles were always noiseless, and the negress always had the worst of them; but she had her revenge. She stinted my rations and my bones, and those of my own body began to show themselves through my skin. But though she cut short my victuals, that did not hinder me from barking; so to make an end of me altogether, she threw me a sponge fried in grease. I perceived the snare, and knew that what she offered me was worse than poison, for it would swell up in the stomach, and never leave it with life. Judging then that it was impossible for me to guard against the insidious attacks of such a base enemy, I resolved to get out of her sight, and put some space between her and me. One day, I found myself at liberty, and without bidding adieu to any of the family, I went into the street; and before I had gone a hundred paces, I fell in with the alguazil I mentioned in the beginning of my story, as being a great friend of my first master Nicholas the butcher. He instantly knew me, and called me by my name. I knew him too, and went up to him with my usual ceremonies and caresses. He took hold of me by the neck, and said to his men, ""This is a famous watch-dog, formerly belonging to a friend of mine: let us bring him home."" The men said, if I was a watch-dog, I should be of great use to them all, and they wanted to lay hold on me to lead me along; but the alguazil said, it was not necessary, for I knew him, and would follow him. I forgot to tell you, that the spiked collar I wore when I ran away from the flock was stolen from me at an inn by a gipsy, and I went without one in Seville; but my new master put on me a collar all studded with brass. Only consider, Scipio, this change in my fortunes, Yesterday I was a student, and to-day I found myself a bailiff.

SCIP
So wags the world, and you need not exaggerate the vicissitudes of fortune, as if there were any difference between the service of a butcher and that of a bailiff. I have no patience when I hear some persons rail at fortune, whose highest hopes never aspired beyond the life of a stable-boy. How they curse their ill-luck, and all to make the hearers believe that they have known better days, and have fallen from some high estate.

BERG
Just so. Now you must know that this alguazil was on intimate terms with an attorney; and the two were connected with a pair of wenches not a bit better than they ought to be, but quite the reverse. They were rather good looking, but full of meretricious arts and impudence. These two served their male associates as baits to fish with. Their dress and deportment was such that you might recognise them for what they were at the distance of a musket shot; they frequented the houses of entertainment for strangers, and the period of the fairs in Cadiz and Seville was their harvest time, for there was not a Breton with whom they did not grapple. Whenever a bumpkin fell into their snares they apprised the alguazil and the attorney to what inn they were going, and the latter then seized the party as lewd persons, but never took them to prison, for the strangers always paid money to get out of the scrape.

One day it happened that Colendres—this was the name of the alguazil's mistress—picked up a Breton, and made an appointment with him for the night, whereof she informed her friend; and they were hardly undressed before the alguazil, the attorney, two bailiffs, and myself entered the room. The amorous pair were sorely disconcerted, and the alguazil, inveighing against the enormity of their conduct, ordered them to dress with all speed, and go with him to prison. The Breton was dismayed, the attorney interceded from motives of compassion, and prevailed on the alguazil to commute the penalty for only a hundred reals. The Breton called for a pair of leather breeches he had laid on a chair at the end of the room, and in which there was money to pay his ransom, but the breeches were not to be seen. The fact was, that when I entered the room, my nostrils were saluted by a delightful odour of ham. I followed the scent, and found a great piece of ham in one of the pockets of the breeches, which I carried off into the street, in order to enjoy the contents without molestation. Having done so, I returned to the house, where I found the Breton vociferating in his barbarous jargon, and calling for his breeches, in one of the pockets of which he said he had fifty gold crowns. The attorney suspected that either Colendres or the bailiffs had stolen the money; the alguazil was of the same opinion, took them aside, and questioned them. None of them knew anything, and they all swore at each other like troopers. Seeing the hubbub, I went back to the street where I had left the breeches, having no use for the money in them; but I could not find them, for some one passing by had no doubt picked them up.

The alguazil, in despair at finding that the Breton had no money to bribe with, thought to indemnify himself by extorting something from the mistress of the house. He called for her, and in she came half dressed, and when she saw and heard the Breton bawling for his money, Colindres crying in her shift, the alguazil storming, the attorney in a passion, and the bailiffs ransacking the room, she was in no very good humour. The alguazil ordered her to put on her clothes and be off with him to prison, for allowing men and women to meet for bad purposes in her house. Then indeed the row grew more furious than ever. ""Señor Alguazil and Señor Attorney,"" said the hostess, ""none of your tricks upon me, for I know a thing or two, I tell you. Give me none of your blustering, but shut your mouth, and go your ways in God's name, otherwise by my faith I'll pitch the house out of the windows, and blow upon you all; for I am well acquainted with the Señora Colendres, and I know moreover that for many months past she has been kept by the Señor Alguazil; so don't provoke me to let out any more, but give this gentleman back his money, and let us all part good friends, for I am a respectable woman, and I have a husband with his patent of nobility with its leaden seals all hanging to it, God be thanked! and I carry on this business with the greatest propriety. I have the table of charges hung up where everybody may see it, so don't meddle with me, or by the Lord I'll soon settle your business. It is no affair of mine if women come in with my lodgers; they have the keys of their rooms, and I am not a lynx to see through seven walls.""

My masters were astounded at the harangue of the landlady, and at finding how well acquainted she was with the story of their lives; but seeing there was nobody else from whom they could squeeze money, they still pretended that they meant to drag her to prison. She appealed to heaven against the unreasonableness and injustice of their behaving in that manner when her husband was absent, and he too a man of such quality. The Breton bellowed for his fifty crowns; the bailiffs persisted in declaring that they had never set eyes on the breeches, God forbid! The attorney privately urged the alguazil to search Colindres' clothes, for he suspected she must have possessed herself of the fifty crowns, since it was her custom to grope in the pockets of those who took up with her company. Colindres declared that the Breton was drunk, and that it was all a lie about his money. All in short was confusion, oaths, and bawling, and there would have been no end to the uproar if the lieutenant corregidor had not just then entered the room, having heard the noise as he was going his rounds. He asked what it was all about, and the landlady replied with great copiousness of detail. She told him who was the damsel Colindres (who by this time had got her clothes on), made known the connection between her and the alguazil, and exposed her plundering tricks; protested her own innocence, and that it was never with her consent that a woman of bad repute had entered her house; cried herself up for a saint, and her husband for a pattern of excellence; and called out to a servant wench to run and fetch her husband's patent of nobility out of the chest, that she might show it to the Señor Lieutenant. He would then be able to judge whether the wife of so respectable a man was capable of anything but what was quite correct. If she did keep a lodging-house, it was because she could not help it. God knows if she would not rather have some comfortable independence to live upon at her ease. The lieutenant, tired of her volubility and her bouncing about the patent of gentility, said to her, ""Sister hostess, I am willing to believe that your husband is a gentleman, but then you must allow he is only a gentleman innkeeper."" The landlady replied with great dignity, ""And where is the family in the world, however good its blood may be, but you may pick some holes in its coat?"" ""Well, all I have to say, sister, is, that you must put on your clothes, and come away to prison."" This brought her down from her high flights at once; she tore her hair, cried, screamed, and prayed, but all in vain; the inexorable lieutenant carried the whole party off to prison, that is to say, the Breton, Colindres, and the landlady. I learned afterwards that the Breton lost his fifty crowns, and was condemned besides to pay costs; the landlady had to pay as much more. Colindres was let off scot free, and the very day she was liberated she picked up a sailor, out of whom she made good her disappointment in the affair of the Breton. Thus you see, Scipio, what serious troubles arose from my gluttony.

SCIP
Say rather from the rascality of your master.

BERG
Nay but listen, for worse remains to be told, since I am loth to speak ill of alguazil and attorneys.

SCIP
Ay, but speaking ill of one is not speaking ill of all. There is many and many an attorney who is honest and upright. They do not all take fees from both parties in a suit; nor extort more than their right; nor go prying about into other people's business in order to entangle them in the webs of the law; nor league with the justice to fleece one side and skin the other. It is not every alguazil that is in collusion with thieves and vagabonds, or keeps a decoy-duck in the shape of a mistress, as your master did. Very many of them are gentlemen in feeling and conduct; neither arrogant nor insolent, nor rogues and knaves, like those who go about inns, measuring the length of strangers' swords, and ruining their owners if they find them a hair's breadth longer than the law allows.[60]

BERG
My master hawked at higher game. He set himself up for a man of valour, piqued himself on making famous captures, and sustained his reputation for courage without risk to his person, but at the cost of his purse. One day at the Puerta de Xeres he fell in, single-handed, with six famous bravoes, whilst I could not render him any assistance, having a muzzle on my mouth, which he made me wear by day and took off at night. I was amazed at his intrepidity and headlong valour. He dashed in and out between the six swords of the ruffians, and made as light of them as if they were so many osier wands. It was wonderful to behold the agility with which he assaulted, his thrusts and parries, and with what judgment and quickness of eye he prevented his enemies from attacking him from behind. In short, in my opinion and that of all the spectators of the fight, he was a very Rhodomont, having fought his men all the way from the Puerta de Xeres to the statues of the college of Maese Rodrigo, a good hundred paces and more. Having put them to flight, he returned to collect the trophies of the battle, consisting of three sheaths, and these he carried to the corregidor, who was then, if I mistake not, the licentiate Sarmiento de Valladares, renowned for the destruction of the Sauceda.[61] As my master walked through the streets, people pointed to him and said, ""There goes the valiant man who ventured, singly, to encounter the flower of the bravoes of Andalusia.""

He spent the remainder of the day in walking about the city, to let himself be seen, and at night we went to the suburb of Triana, to a street near the powder-mill, where my master, looking about to see if any one observed him, entered a house, myself following him, and in the court-yard we found the six rogues he had fought with, all untrussed, and without cloaks or swords. One fellow, who appeared to be the landlord, had a big jar of wine in one hand and a great tavern goblet in the other, and, filling a sparkling bumper, he drank to all the company. No sooner had they set eyes on my master than they all ran to him with open arms. They all drank his health, and he returned the compliment in every instance, and would have done it in as many more had there been occasion—so affable he was and so averse to disoblige any one for trifles. Were I to recount all that took place there—the supper that was served up, the fights and the robberies they related, the ladies of their acquaintance whom they praised or disparaged, the encomiums they bestowed on each other, the absent bravoes whom they named, the clever tricks they played, jumping up from supper to exhibit their sleight of hand, the picked words they used, and, finally, the figure of the host, whom all respected as their lord and father,—were I to attempt this, I should entangle myself in a maze, from which I could never extricate myself. I ascertained that the master of the house, whose name was Monipodio, was a regular fence, and that my master's battle of the morning had been preconcerted between him and his opponents, with all its circumstances, including the dropping of the sword-sheaths, which my master now delivered, in lieu of his share of the reckoning. The entertainment was continued almost till breakfast time; and, by way of a final treat, they gave my master information of a foreign bravo, an out-and-outer, just arrived in the city. In all probability he was an abler blade than themselves, and they denounced him from envy. My master captured him the next night as he lay in bed; but had he been up and armed, there was that in his face and figure which told me that he would not have allowed himself to be taken so quietly. This capture, coming close upon the heels of the pretended fight, enhanced the fame of my poltroon of a master, who had no more courage than a hare, but sustained his valorous reputation by treating and feasting; so that all the gains of his office, both fair and foul, were frittered away upon his false renown.

I am afraid I weary you, Scipio, but have patience and listen to another affair that befel him, which I will tell you without a tittle more or less than the truth. Two thieves stole a fine horse in Antequera, brought him to Seville, and in order to sell him without risk, adopted what struck me as being a very ingenious stratagem. They put up at two different inns, and one of them entered a plaint in the courts of law, to the effect that Pedro de Losada owed him four hundred reals, money lent, as appeared by a note of hand, signed by the said Pedro, which he produced in evidence. The lieutenant corregidor directed that Losada should be called upon to state whether or not he acknowledged the note as his own, and if he did, that he should be compelled to pay the amount by seizure of his goods, or go to prison. My master and his friend the attorney were employed in this business. One of the thieves took them to the lodgings of the other, who at once acknowledged his note of hand, admitted the debt, and offered his horse in satisfaction of the amount. My master was greatly taken with the animal, and resolved to have it if it should be sold. The time prescribed by the law being expired, the horse was put up for sale; my master employed a friend to bid for it, and it was knocked down to him for five hundred reals, though well worth twelve or thirteen hundred. Thus one thief obtained payment of the debt which was not due to him, the other a quittance of which he had no need, and my master became possessed of the horse, which was as fatal to him as the famous Sejanus[62] was to his owners.

The thieves decamped at once; and two days afterwards my master, after having repaired the horse's trappings, appeared on his back in the Plaza de San Francisco, as proud and conceited as a bumpkin in his holiday clothes. Everybody complimented him on his bargain, declaring the horse was worth a hundred and fifty ducats as surely as an egg was worth a maravedi. But whilst he was caracolling and curvetting, and showing off his own person and his horse's paces, two men of good figure and very well dressed entered the square, one of whom cried out, ""Why, bless my soul! that is my horse Ironfoot, that was stolen from me a few days ago in Antequera."" Four servants, who accompanied him, said the same thing. My master was greatly chopfallen; the gentleman appealed to justice, produced his proofs, and they were so satisfactory that sentence was given in his favour, and my master was dispossessed of the horse. The imposture was exposed; and it came out how, through the hands of justice itself, the thieves had sold what they had stolen; and almost everybody rejoiced that my master's covetousness had made him burn his fingers.

His disasters did not end there. That night the lieutenant going his rounds, was informed that there were robbers abroad as far as San Julian's wards. Passing a cross-road he saw a man running away, and taking me by the collar, ""At him, good dog!"" he said, ""At him, boy!"" Disgusted as I was with my master's villanies, and eager to obey the lieutenant's orders, I made no hesitation to seize my own master and pull him down to the ground, where I would have torn him to pieces if the thief-takers had not with great difficulty separated us. They wanted to punish me, and even to beat me to death with sticks; and they would have done so if the lieutenant had not bade them let me alone, for I had only done what he ordered me. The warning was not lost upon me, so without taking my leave of anybody, I leaped through an opening in the wall, and before daybreak I was in Mayrena, a place about four leagues from Seville.

There by good luck I fell in with a party of soldiers, who, as I heard, were going to embark at Cartagena. Among them were four of my late master's ruffian friends; one of them was the drummer, who had been a catchpole and a great buffoon, as drummers frequently are. They all knew me and spoke to me, asking after my master as if I could reply; but the one who showed the greatest liking for me was the drummer, and so I determined to attach myself to him, if he would let me, and to accompany the expedition whether they were bound for Italy or Flanders. For in spite of the proverb, a blockhead at home is a blockhead all the world over, you must agree with me that travelling and sojourning among various people makes men wise.

SCIP
That is so true that I remember to have heard from a master of mine, a very clever man, that the famous Greek, Ulysses, was renowned as wise solely because he had travelled and seen many men and nations. I therefore applaud your determination to go with the soldiers, wherever they might take you.

BERG
To help him in the display of his jugglery, the drummer began to teach me to dance to the sound of the drum, and to play other monkey tricks such as no other dog than myself could ever have acquired. The detachment marched by very short stages; we had no commissary to control us; the captain was a mere lad, but a perfect gentleman, and a great christian; the ensign had but just left the page's hall at the court; the serjeant was a knowing blade, and a great conductor of companies from the place where they were raised to the port of embarkation. The detachment was full of ruffians whose insolent behaviour, in the places through which we passed, redounded in curses directed to a quarter where they were not deserved. It is the misfortune of the good prince to be blamed by some of his subjects, for faults committed by others of them, which he could not remedy if he would, for the circumstances attendant on war are for the most part inevitably harsh, oppressive, and untoward.

In the course of a fortnight, what with my own cleverness, and the diligence of him I had chosen for my patron, I learned to jump for the king of France, and not to jump for the good-for-nothing landlady; he taught me to curvet like a Neapolitan courser, to move in a ring like a mill horse, and other things which might have made one suspect that they were performed by a demon in the shape of a dog. The drummer gave me the name of the wise dog, and no sooner were we arrived at a halting place, than he went about, beating his drum, and giving notice to all who desired to behold the marvellous graces and performances of the wise dog, that they were to be seen at such a house, for four or eight maravedis a head, according to the greater or less wealth of the place. After these encomiums everybody ran to see me, and no one went away without wonder and delight. My master exulted in the gains I brought him, which enabled him to maintain six of his comrades like princes. The envy and covetousness of the rogues was excited, and they were always watching for an opportunity to steal me, for any way of making money by sport has great charms for many. This is why there are so many puppet showmen in Spain, so many who go about with peep shows, so many others who hawk pens and ballads, though their stock, if they sold it all, would not be enough to keep them for a day; and yet they are to be found in taverns and drinking-shops all the year round, whence I infer that the cost of their guzzling is defrayed by other means than the profits of their business. They are all good-for-nothing vagabonds, bread weevils and winesponges.

SCIP
No more of that, Berganza; let us not go over the same ground again. Continue your story, for the night is waning, and I should not like, when the sun rises, that we should be left in the shades of silence.

BERG
Keep it and listen. As it is an easy thing to extend and improve our inventions, my master, seeing how well I imitated a Neapolitan courser, made me housings of gilt leather, and a little saddle, which he fitted on my back; he put on it a little figure of a man, with lance in hand, and taught me to run straight at a ring fixed between two stakes. As soon as I was perfect in that performance, my master announced that on that day the wise dog would run at the ring, and exhibit other new and incomparable feats, which, indeed, I drew from my own invention, not to give my master the lie. We next marched to Montilla, a town belonging to the famous and great christian, Marquis of Priego, head of the house of Aguilar and Montilla. My master was quartered, at his own request, in a hospital; he made his usual proclamation, and as my great fame had already reached the town, the court-yard was filled with spectators in less than an hour. My master rejoiced to see such a plenteous harvest, and resolved to show himself that day a first-rate conjuror. The entertainment began with my leaping through a hoop. He had a willow switch in his hand, and when he lowered it, that was a signal for me to leap; and when he kept it raised, I was not to budge.

On that day (for ever memorable in my life) he began by saying, ""Come, my friend, jump for that juvenile old gentleman, you know, who blacks his beard; or, if you won't, jump for the pomp and grandeur of Donna Pimpinela de Plafagonia, who was the fellow servant of the Galician kitchen wench at Valdeastillas. Don't you like that, my boy? Then jump for the bachelor Pasillas, who signs himself licentiate without having any degree. How lazy you are! Why don't you jump? Oh! I understand! I am up to your roguery! Jump, then, for the wine of Esquivias, a match for that of Ciudad Real, St. Martin, and Rivadavia."" He lowered the switch, and I jumped in accordance with the signal. Then, addressing the audience, ""Do not imagine, worshipful senate,"" he said, ""that it is any laughing matter what this dog knows. I have taught him four-and-twenty performances, the least of which is worth going thirty leagues to see. He can dance the zaraband and the chacona better than their inventor; he tosses off a pint of wine without spilling a drop; he intones a sol, fa, mi, re, as well as any sacristan. All these things, and many others which remain to be told, your worships shall witness during the time the company remains here. At present, our wise one will give another jump, and then we will enter upon the main business.""

Having inflamed the curiosity of the audience, or senate, as he called them, with this harangue, he turned to me and said, ""Come now, my lad, and go through all your jumps with your usual grace and agility; but this time it shall be for the sake of the famous witch who is said to belong to this place."" The words were hardly out of his mouth, when the matron of the hospital, an old woman, who seemed upwards of seventy, screamed out, ""Rogue, charlatan, swindler, there is no witch here. If you mean Camacha, she has paid the penalty of her sin, and is where God only knows; if you mean me, you juggling cheat, I am no witch, and never was one in my life; and if I ever was reputed to be a witch, I may thank false witnesses, and the injustice of the law, and a presumptuous and ignorant judge. All the world knows the life of penance I lead, not for any acts of witchcraft, which I have never done, but for other great sins which I have committed as a poor sinner. So get out of the hospital, you rascally sheep-skin thumper, or by all the saints I'll make you glad to quit it at a run."" And with that she began to screech at such a rate, and pour such a furious torrent of abuse upon my master, that he was utterly confounded. In fine, she would not allow the entertainment to proceed on any account. My master did not care much about the row, as he had his money in his pocket, and he announced that he would give the performance next day in another hospital. The people went away cursing the old woman, and calling her a witch, and a bearded hag into the bargain. We remained for all that in the hospital that night, and the old woman meeting me alone in the yard, said, ""Is that you, Montiel, my son? Is that you?"" I looked up as she spoke, and gazed steadily at her, seeing which, she came to me with tears in her eyes, threw her arms round my neck, and would have kissed my mouth if I had allowed her; but I was disgusted, and would not endure it.

SCIP
You were quite right, for it is no treat, but quite the reverse, to kiss or be kissed by an old woman.

BERG
What I am now going to relate I should have told you at the beginning of my story, as it would have served to diminish the surprise we felt at finding ourselves endowed with speech. Said the old woman to me, ""Follow me, Montiel, my son, that you may know my room; and be sure you come to me to-night, that we may be alone together, for I have many things to tell you of great importance for you to know."" I drooped my head in token of obedience, which confirmed her in her belief that I was the dog Montiel whom she had been long looking for, as she afterwards told me. I remained bewildered with surprise, longing for the night to see what might be the meaning of this mystery or prodigy, and as I had heard her called a witch, I expected wonderful things from the interview. At last the time came, and I entered the room, which was small, and low, and dimly lighted by an earthenware lamp. The old woman trimmed it, sat down on a chest, drew me to her, and without speaking a word, fell to embracing me, and I to taking care that she did not kiss me.

""I did always hope in heaven,"" the old woman began, ""that I should see my son before my eyes were closed in the last sleep; and now that I have seen you, let death come when it will, and release me from this life of sorrow. You must know, my son, that there lived in this city the most famous witch in the world, called Camacha de Montilla. She was so perfect in her art, that the Erichtheas, Circes, and Medeas, of whom old histories, I am told, are full, were not to be compared to her. She congealed the clouds when she pleased, and covered the face of the sun with them; and when the whim seized her, she made the murkiest sky clear up at once. She fetched men in an instant from remote lands; admirably relieved the distresses of damsels who had forgot themselves for a moment; enabled widows to console themselves without loss of reputation; unmarried wives, and married those she pleased. She had roses in her garden in December, and gathered wheat in January. To make watercresses grow in a handbasin was a trifle to her, or to show any persons whom you wanted to see, either dead or alive, in a looking-glass, or on the nail of a newborn infant. It was reported that she turned men into brutes, and that she made an ass of a sacristan, and used him really and truly in that form for six years. I never could make out how this was done; for as for what is related of those ancient sorceresses, that they turned men into beasts, the learned are of opinion that this means only that by their great beauty and their fascinations, they so captivated men and subjected them to their humours, as to make them seem unreasoning animals. But in you, my son, I have a living instance to the contrary, for I know that you are a rational being, and I see you in the form of a dog; unless indeed this is done through that art which they call Tropelia, which makes people mistake appearances and take one thing for another.

""Be this as it may, what mortifies me is that neither your mother nor myself, who were disciples of the great Camacha, ever came to know as much as she did, and that not for want of capacity, but through her inordinate selfishness, which could never endure that we should learn the higher mysteries of her art, and be as wise as herself. Your mother, my son, was called Montiela, and next to Camacha, she was the most famous of witches. My name is Cañizares; and, if not equal in proficiency to either of these two, at least I do not yield to them in good will to the art. It is true that in boldness of spirit, in the intrepidity with which she entered a circle, and remained enclosed in it with a legion of fiends, your mother was in no wise inferior to Camacha herself; while, for my part, I was always somewhat timid, and contented myself with conjuring half a legion; but though I say it that should not, in the matter of compounding witches' ointment, I would not turn my back upon either of them, no, nor upon any living who follow our rules. But you must know, my son, ever since I have felt how fast my life is hastening away upon the light wings of time, I have sought to withdraw from all the wickedness of witchcraft in which I was plunged for many years, and I have only amused myself with white magic, a practice so engaging that it is most difficult to forego it. Your mother acted in the same manner; she abandoned many evil practices, and performed many righteous works; but she would not relinquish white magic to the hour of her death. She had no malady, but died by the sorrow brought upon her by her mistress, Camacha, who hated her because she saw that in a short time Montiela would know as much as herself, unless indeed she had some other cause of jealousy not known to me.

""Your mother was pregnant, and her time being come, Camacha was her midwife. She received in her hands what your mother brought forth, and showed her that she had borne two puppy dogs. 'This is a bad business,' said Camacha; 'there is some knavery here. But, sister Montiela, I am your friend, and I will conceal this unfortunate birth; so have patience and get well, and be assured that your misfortune shall remain an inviolable secret.' I was present at this extraordinary occurrence, and was not less astounded than your mother. Camacha went away taking the whelps with her, and I remained to comfort the lying-in woman, who could not bring herself to believe what had happened. At last Camacha's end drew near, and when she felt herself at the point of death, she sent for her and told her how she had turned her sons into dogs on account of a certain grudge she bore her, but that she need not distress herself, for they would return to their natural forms when it was least expected; but this would not happen 'until they shall see the exalted quickly brought low, and the lowly exalted by an arm that is mighty to do it.'

""Your mother wrote down this prophecy, and deeply engraved it in her memory, and so did I, that I might impart it to one of you if ever the opportunity should present itself. And in hopes to recognise you, I have made it a practice to call every dog of your colour by your mother's name, to see if any of them would answer to one so unlike those usually given to dogs; and, this evening, when I saw you do so many things, and they called you the wise dog, and also when you looked up at me upon my calling to you in the yard, I believed that you were really the son of Montiela. It is with extreme pleasure I acquaint you with the history of your birth, and the manner in which you are to recover your original form. I wish it was as easy as it was for the golden ass of Apuleius, who had only to eat a rose for his restoration; but yours depends upon the actions of others, and not upon your own efforts. What you have to do meanwhile, my son, is to commend yourself heartily to God, and hope for the speedy and prosperous fulfilment of the prophecy; for since it was pronounced by Camacha it will be accomplished without any doubt, and you and your brother, if he is alive, will see yourselves as you would wish to be. All that grieves me is that I am so near my end, that I can have no hope of witnessing the joyful event.

""I have often longed to ask my goat how matters would turn out with you at last; but I had not the courage to do so, for he never gives a straightforward answer, but as crooked and perplexing as possible. That is always the way with our lord and master; there is no use in asking him anything, for with one truth he mingles a thousand lies, and from what I have noted of his replies it appears that he knows nothing for certain of the future, but only by way of conjecture. At the same time he so be-fools us that, in spite of a thousand treacherous tricks he plays us, we cannot shake off his influence. We go to see him a long way from here in a great field, where we meet a multitude of warlocks and witches, and are feasted without measure, and other things take place which, indeed and in truth, I cannot bring myself to mention, nor will I offend your chaste ears by repeating things so filthy and abominable. Many are of opinion that we frequent these assemblies only in imagination, wherein the demon presents to us the images of all those things which we afterwards relate as having occurred to us in reality; others, on the contrary, believe that we actually go to them in body and soul; and for my part I believe that both opinions are true, since we know not when we go in the one manner or in the other; for all that happens to us in imagination does so with such intensity, that it is impossible to distinguish between it and reality. Their worships the inquisitors have had sundry opportunities of investigating this matter, in the cases of some of us whom they have had under their hands, and I believe that they have ascertained the truth of what I state.

""I should like, my son, to shake off this sin, and I have exerted myself to that end. I have got myself appointed matron to this hospital; I tend the poor, and some die who afford me a livelihood either by what they leave me, or by what I find among their rags, through the great care I always take to examine them well. I say but few prayers, and only in public, but grumble a good deal in secret. It is better for me to be a hypocrite than an open sinner; for my present good works efface from the memory of those who know me the bad ones of my past life. After all, pretended sanctity injures no one but the person who practises it. Look you, Montiel, my son, my advice to you is this: be good all you can; but if you must be wicked, contrive all you can not to appear so. I am a witch, I do not deny it, and your mother was one likewise; but the appearances we put on were always enough to maintain our credit in the eyes of the whole world. Three days before she died, we were both present at a grand sabbath of witches in a valley of the Pyrenees; and yet when she died it was with such calmness and serenity, that were it not for some grimaces she made a quarter of an hour before she gave up the ghost, you would have thought she lay upon a bed of flowers. But her two children lay heavy at her heart, and even to her last gasp she never would forgive Camacha, such a resolute spirit she had. I closed her eyes and followed her to the grave, and there took my last look at her; though, indeed, I have not lost the hope of seeing her again before I die, for they say that several persons have met her going about the churchyards and the cross-roads in various forms, and who knows but I may fall in with her some time or other, and be able to ask her whether I can do anything for the relief of her conscience?""

Every word that the old hag uttered in praise of her she called my mother went like a knife to my heart; I longed to fall upon her and tear her to pieces, and only refrained from unwillingness that death should find her in such a wicked state. Finally she told me that she intended to anoint herself that night and go to one of their customary assemblies, and inquire of her master as to what was yet to befal me. I should have liked to ask her what were the ointments she made use of; and it seemed as though she read my thoughts, for she replied to my question as though it had been uttered.

""This ointment,"" she said, ""is composed of the juices of exceedingly cold herbs, and not, as the vulgar assert, of the blood of children whom we strangle. And here you may be inclined to ask what pleasure or profit can it be to the devil to make us murder little innocents, since he knows that being baptised they go as sinless creatures to heaven, and every Christian soul that escapes him is to him a source of poignant anguish. I know not what answer to give to this except by quoting the old saying, that some people would give both their eyes to make their enemy lose one. He may do it for sake of the grief beyond imagination which the parents suffer from the murder of their children; but what is still more important to him is to accustom us to the repeated commission of such a cruel and perverse sin. And all this God allows by reason of our sinfulness; for without his permission, as I know by experience, the devil has not the power to hurt a pismire; and so true is this, that one day when I requested him to destroy a vineyard belonging to an enemy of mine, he told me that he could not hurt a leaf of it, for God would not allow him. Hence you may understand when you come to be a man, that all the casual evils that befal men, kingdoms, and cities, and peoples, sudden deaths, shipwrecks, devastations, and all sorts of losses and disasters, come from the hand of the Almighty, and by his sovereign permission; and the evils which fall under the denomination of crime, are caused by ourselves. God is without sin, whence it follows that we ourselves are the authors of sin, forming it in thought, word, and deed; God permitting all this by reason of our sinfulness, as I have already said.

""Possibly you will ask, my son, if so be you understand me, who made me a theologian? And mayhap you will say to yourself, Confound the old hag! why does not she leave off being a witch since she knows so much? Why does not she turn to God, since she knows that he is readier to forgive sin than to permit it? To this I reply, as though you had put the question to me, that the habit of sinning becomes a second nature, and that of being a witch transforms itself into flesh and blood; and amidst all its ardour, which is great, it brings with it a chilling influence which so overcomes the soul as to freeze and benumb its faith, whence follows a forgetfulness of itself, and it remembers neither the terrors with which God threatens it, nor the glories with which he allures it. In fact, as sin is fleshly and sensual, it must exhaust and stupefy all the feelings, and render the soul incapable of rising to embrace any good thought, or to clasp the hand which God in his mercy continually holds out to it. I have one of those souls I have described; I see it clearly; but the empire of the senses enchains my will, and I have ever been and ever shall be bad.

""But let us quit this subject, and go back to that of our unguents. They are of so cold a nature that they take away all our senses when we anoint ourselves with them; we remain stretched on the ground, and then they say we experience all those things in imagination which we suppose to occur to us in reality. Sometimes after we have anointed and changed ourselves into fowls, foals, or deer, we go to the place where our master awaits us. There we recover our own forms and enjoy pleasures which I will not describe, for they are such as the memory is ashamed to recal, and the tongue refuses to relate. The short and the long of it is, I am a witch, and cover my many delinquencies with the cloak of hypocrisy. It is true that if some esteem and honour me as a good woman, there are many who bawl in my ear the name imprinted upon your mother and me by order of an ill-tempered judge, who committed his wrath to the hands of the hangman; and the latter, not being bribed, used his plenary power upon our shoulders. But that is past and gone; and all things pass, memories wear out, lives do not renew themselves, tongues grow tired, and new events make their predecessors forgotten. I am matron of a hospital; my behaviour is plausible in appearance; my unguents procure me some pleasant moments, and I am not so old but that I may live another year, my age being seventy-five. I cannot fast on account of my years, nor pray on account of the swimming in my head, nor go on pilgrimages for the weakness of my legs, nor give alms because I am poor, nor think rightly because I am given to back-biting, and to be able to backbite one must first think evil. I know for all that that God is good and merciful, and that he knows what is in store for me, and that is enough; so let us drop this conversation which really makes me melancholy. Come, my son, and see me anoint myself; for there is a cure for every sorrow; and though the pleasures which the devil affords us are illusive and fictitious, yet they appear to us to be pleasures; and sensual delight is much greater in imagination than in actual fruition, though it is otherwise with true joys.""

After this long harangue she got up, and taking the lamp went into another and smaller room. I followed her, filled with a thousand conflicting thoughts, and amazed at what I had heard and what I expected to see. Cañizares hung the lamp against the wall, hastily stripped herself to her shift, took a jug from a corner, put her hand into it, and, muttering between her teeth, anointed herself from her feet to the crown of her head. Before she had finished she said to me, that whether her body remained senseless in that room, or whether it quitted it, I was not to be frightened, nor fail to wait there till morning, when she would bring me word of what was to befal me until I should be a man. I signified my assent by drooping my head; and she finished her unction, and stretched herself on the floor like a corpse. I put my mouth to hers, and perceived that she did not breathe at all. One thing I must own to you, friend Scipio, that I was terribly frightened at seeing myself shut up in that narrow room with that figure before me, which I will describe to you as well as I can.

She was more than six feet high, a mere skeleton covered with a black wrinkled skin. Her dugs were like two dried and puckered ox-bladders; her lips were blackened; her long teeth locked together; her nose was hooked; her eyes starting from her head; her hair hung in elf-locks on her hollow wrinkled cheeks;—in short, she was all over diabolically hideous. I remained gazing on her for a while, and felt myself overcome with horror as I contemplated the hideous spectacle of her body, and the worse occupation of her soul. I wanted to bite her to see if she would come to herself, but I could not find a spot on her whole body that did not fill me with disgust. Nevertheless, I seized her by one heel, and dragged her to the yard, without her ever giving any sign of feeling. There seeing myself at large with the sky above me, my fear left me, or at least abated, so much as to give me courage to await the result of that wicked woman's expedition, and the news she was to bring me. Meanwhile, I asked myself, how comes this old woman to be at once so knowing and so wicked? How is it that she can so well distinguish between casual and culpable evils? How is it that she understands and speaks so much about God, and acts so much from the prompting of the devil? How is it that she sins so much from choice, not having the excuse of ignorance?

In these reflections I passed the night. The day dawned and found us both in the court, she lying still insensible, and I on my haunches beside her, attentively watching her hideous countenance. The people of the hospital came out, and seeing this spectacle, some of them exclaimed, ""The pious Cañizares is dead! See how emaciated she is with fasting and penance."" Others felt her pulse, and finding that she was not dead, concluded that she was in a trance of holy ecstacy; whilst others said, ""This old hag is unquestionably a witch, and is no doubt anointed, for saints are never seen in such an indecent condition when they are lost in religious ecstacy; and among us who know her, she has hitherto had the reputation of a witch rather than a saint."" Some curious inquirers went so far as to stick pins in her flesh up to the head, yet without ever awaking her. It was not till seven o'clock that she came to herself; and then finding how she was stuck over with pins, bitten in the heels, and her back flayed by being dragged from her room, and seeing so many eyes intently fixed upon her, she rightly concluded that I had been the cause of her exposure. ""What, you thankless, ignorant, malicious villain,"" she cried, ""is this my reward for the acts I did for your mother and those I intended to do for you?"" Finding myself in peril of my life under the talons of that ferocious harpy, I shook her off, and seizing her by her wrinkled flank, I worried and dragged her all about the yard, whilst she shrieked for help from the fangs of that evil spirit. At these words, most present believed that I must be one of those fiends who are continually at enmity with good Christians. Some were for sprinkling me with holy water, some were for pulling me off the old woman, but durst not; others bawled out words to exorcise me. The witch howled, I tightened my grip with my teeth, the confusion increased, and my master was in despair, hearing it said that I was a fiend. A few who knew nothing of exorcisms caught up three or four sticks and began to baste me. Not liking the joke, I let go the old woman; in three bounds I was in the street, and in a few more I was outside the town, pursued by a host of boys, shouting, ""Out of the way! the wise dog is gone mad."" Others said ""he is not mad, but he is the devil in the form of a dog."" The people of the place were confirmed in their belief that I was a devil by the tricks they had seen me perform, by the words spoken by the old woman when she woke out of her infernal trance, and by the extraordinary speed with which I shot away from them, so that I seemed to vanish from before them like a being of the other world. In six hours I cleared twelve leagues; and arrived at a camp of gipsies in a field near Granada. There I rested awhile, for some of the gipsies who recognised me as the wise dog, received me with great delight, and hid me in a cave, that I might not be found if any one came in search of me; their intention being, as I afterwards learned, to make money by me as my master the drummer had done. I remained twenty days among them, during which I observed their habits and ways of life; and these are so remarkable that I must give you an account of them.

SCIP
Before you go any further, Berganza, we had better consider what the witch said to you, and see if there can possibly be a grain of truth in the great lie to which you give credit. Now, what an enormous absurdity it would be to believe that Camacha could change human beings into brutes, or that the sacristan served her for years under the form of an ass. All these things, and the like, are cheats, lies, or illusions of the devil; and if it now seems to ourselves that we have some understanding and reason—since we speak, though we are really dogs or bear that form—we have already said that this is a portentous and unparalleled case; and though it is palpably before us, yet we must suspend our belief until the event determines what it should be. Shall I make this more plain to you? Consider upon what frivolous things Camacha declared our restoration to depend, and that what seems a prophecy to you is nothing but a fable, or one of those old woman's tales, such as the headless horse, and the wand of virtues, which are told by the fireside in the long winter nights; for were it anything else it would already have been accomplished, unless, indeed, it is to be taken in what I have heard called an allegorical sense: that is to say, a sense which is not the same as that which the letter imports, but which, though differing from it, yet resembles it. Now for your prophecy:—""They are to recover their true forms when they shall see the exalted quickly brought low, and the lowly exalted by a hand that is mighty to do it."" If we take this in the sense I have mentioned, it seems to me to mean that we shall recover our forms when we shall see those who yesterday were at the top of fortune's wheel, to-day cast down in the mire, and held of little account by those who most esteemed them; so, likewise, when we shall see others who, but two hours ago, seemed sent into the world only to figure as units in the sum of its population, and now are lifted up to the very summit of prosperity. Now, if our return, as you say, to human form, were to depend on this, why we have already seen it, and we see it every hour. I infer, then, that Camacha's words are to be taken, not in an allegorical, but in a literal, sense; but this will help us out no better, since we have many times seen what they say, and we are still dogs, as you see. And so Carnacha was a cheat, Cañizares an artful hag, and Montiela a fool and a rogue—be it said without offence, if by chance she was the mother of us both, or yours, for I won't have her for mine. Furthermore, I say that the true meaning is a game of nine-pins, in which those that stand up are quickly knocked down, and the fallen are set up again, and that by a hand that is able to do it. Now think whether or not in the course of our lives we have ever seen a game of nine-pins, or having seen it, have therefore been changed into men.

BERG
I quite agree with you Scipio, and have a higher opinion of your judgment than ever. From all you have said, I am come to think and believe that all that has happened to us hitherto, and that is now happening, is a dream; but let us not therefore fail to enjoy this blessing of speech, and the great excellence of holding human discourse all the time we may; and so let it not weary you to hear me relate what befel me with the gipsies who hid me in the cave.

SCIP
With great pleasure. I will listen to you, that you in your turn may listen to me, when I relate, if heaven pleases, the events of my life.

BERG
My occupation among the gipsies was to contemplate their numberless tricks and frauds, and the thefts they all commit from the time they are out of leading-strings and can walk alone. You know what a multitude there is of them dispersed all over Spain. They all know each other, keep up a constant intelligence among themselves, and reciprocally pass off and carry away the articles they have purloined. They render less obedience to their king than to one of their own people whom they style count, and who bears the surname of Maldonado, as do all his descendants. This is not because they come of that noble line, but because a page belonging to a cavalier of that name fell in love with a beautiful gipsy, who would not yield to his wishes unless he became a gipsy and made her his wife. The page did so, and was so much liked by the other gipsies, that they chose him for their lord, yielded him obedience, and in token of vassalage rendered to him a portion of everything they stole, whatever it might be.

To give a colour to their idleness the gipsies employ themselves in working in iron, and you may always see them hawking pincers, tongs, hammers, fire-shovels, and so forth, the sale of which facilitates their thefts. The women are all midwives, and in this they have the advantage over others, for they bring forth without cost or attendants. They wash their new-born infants in cold water, and accustom them from birth to death to endure every inclemency of weather. Hence they are all strong, robust, nimble leapers, runners, and dancers. They always marry among themselves, in order that their bad practices may not come to be known, except by their own people. The women are well behaved to their husbands, and few of them intrigue except with persons of their own race. When they seek for alms, it is rather by tricks and juggling than by appeals to charity; and as no one puts faith in them, they keep none, but own themselves downright vagabonds; nor do I remember to have ever seen a gipsy-woman taking the sacrament, though I have often been in the churches. The only thoughts of their minds are how to cheat and steal. They are fond of talking about their thefts and how they effected them. A gipsy, for instance, related one day in my presence how he had swindled a countryman as you shall hear:

The gipsy had an ass with a docked tail, and he fitted a false tail to the stump so well that it seemed quite natural. Then he took the ass to market and sold it to a countryman for ten ducats. Having pocketed the money, he told the countryman that if he wanted another ass, own brother to the one he had bought, and every bit as good, he might have it a bargain. The countryman told him to go and fetch it, and meanwhile he would drive that one home. Away went the purchaser; the gipsy followed him, and some how or other, it was not long before he had stolen the ass, from which he immediately whipped off the false tail, leaving only a bare stump. He then changed the halter and saddle, and had the audacity to go and offer the animal for sale to the countryman, before the latter had discovered his loss. The bargain was soon made; the purchaser went into his house to fetch the money to pay for the second ass, and there he discovered the loss of the first. Stupid as he was, he suspected that the gipsy had stolen the animal, and he refused to pay him. The gipsy brought forward as witness the man who had received the alcabala[63] on the first transaction, and who swore that he had sold the countryman an ass with a very bushy tail, quite different from the second one; and an alguazil, who was present, took the gipsy's part so strongly that the countryman was forced to pay for the ass twice over. Many other stories they told, all about stealing beasts of burden, in which art they are consummate masters. In short, they are a thoroughly bad race, and though many able magistrates have taken them in hand, they have always remained incorrigible.

After I had remained with them twenty days, they set out for Murcia, taking me with them. We passed through Granada, where the company was quartered to which my master the drummer belonged. As the gipsies were aware of this, they shut me up in the place where they were lodged. I overheard them talking about their journey, and thinking that no good would come of it, I contrived to give them the slip, quitted Granada, and entered the garden of a Morisco,[64] who gladly received me. I was quite willing to remain with him and watch his garden,—a much less fatiguing business in my opinion than guarding a flock of sheep; and as there was no need to discuss the question of wages, the Morisco soon had a servant and I a master. I remained with him more than a month, not that the life I led with him was much to my liking, but because it gave me opportunities of observing that of my master, which was like that of all the other Moriscoes in Spain. O what curious things I could tell you, friend Scipio, about that half Paynim rabble, if I were not afraid that I should not get to the end of my story in a fortnight! Nay, if I were to go into particulars, two months would not be enough. Some few specimens, however, you shall hear.

Hardly will you find among the whole race one man who is a sincere believer in the holy law of Christianity. Their only thought is how to scrape up money and keep it; and to this end they toil incessantly and spend nothing. The moment a real falls into their clutches, they condemn it to perpetual imprisonment; so that by dint of perpetually accumulating and never spending, they have got the greater part of the money of Spain into their hands. They are the grubs, the magpies, the weasels of the nation. Consider how numerous they are, and that every day they add much or little to their hoards, and that as they increase in number so the amount of their hoarded wealth must increase without end. None of them of either sex make monastic vows, but all marry and multiply, for thrifty living is a great promoter of fecundity. They are not wasted by war or excessive toil; they plunder us in a quiet way, and enrich themselves with the fruits of our patrimonies which they sell back to us. They have no servants, for they all wait upon themselves. They are at no expense for the education of their sons, for all their lore is but how to rob us. From the twelve sons of Jacob, who entered Egypt, as I have heard, there had sprung, when Moses freed them from captivity, six hundred thousand fighting men, besides women and children. From this we may infer how much the Moriscoes have multiplied, and how incomparably greater must be their numbers.

SCIP
Means have been sought for remedying the mischiefs you have mentioned and hinted at; and, indeed, I am sure that those which you have passed over in silence, are even more serious than those which you have touched upon. But our commonwealth has most wise and zealous champions, who, considering that Spain produces and retains in her bosom such vipers as the Moriscoes, will, with God's help, provide a sure and prompt remedy for so great an evil. Go on.

BERG
My master being a stingy hunks, like all his caste, I lived like himself chiefly on maize bread and buckwheat porridge; but this penury helped me to gain paradise, in the strange manner you shall hear. Every morning, by daybreak, a young man used to seat himself at the foot of one of the many pomegranate trees. He had the look of a student, being dressed in a rusty suit of threadbare baize, and was occupied in writing in a note book, slapping his forehead from time to time, biting his nails, and gazing up at the sky. Sometimes he was so immersed in reverie, that he neither moved hand nor foot, nor even winked his eyes. One day I drew near him unperceived, and heard him muttering between his teeth. At last, after a long silence, he cried out aloud, ""Glorious! The very best verse I ever composed in my life!"" and down went something in his note book. From all this, it was plain that the luckless wight was a poet. I approached him with my ordinary courtesies, and when I had convinced him of my gentleness, he let me lie down at his feet, and resumed the course of his thoughts, scratching his head, falling into ecstacies, and then writing as before.

Meanwhile there came into the garden another young man, handsome and well dressed, with papers in his hand, at which he glanced from time to time. The new comer walked up to the pomegranate tree, and said to the poet, ""Have you finished the first act?""

""I have just this moment finished it in the happiest manner possible,"" was the reply.

""How is that?""

""I will tell you! His Holiness the Pope comes forth in his pontificals, with twelve cardinals in purple canonicals—for the action of my comedy is supposed to take place at the season of mutatio caparum, when their eminences are not dressed in scarlet but in purple—therefore propriety absolutely requires that my cardinals should wear purple. This is a capital point, and one on which your common run of writers would be sure to blunder; but as for me I could not go wrong, for I have read the whole Roman ceremonial through, merely that I might be exact as to these dresses.""

""But where do you suppose,"" said the other, ""that our manager is to find purple robes for twelve cardinals?""

""If a single one is wanting,"" cried the poet, ""I would as soon think of flying, as of letting my comedy be represented without it. Zounds! is the public to lose that magnificent spectacle! Just imagine the splendid effect on the stage of a supreme Pontiff and twelve grave cardinals, with all the other dignitaries, who will of course accompany them! By heavens, it will be one of the grandest things ever seen on the stage, not excepting even the nosegay of Duraja!""

I now perceived that one of these young men was a poet, and the other a comedian. The latter advised the former that he should cut out a few of his cardinals, if he did not want to make it impossible for the manager to produce the piece. The poet would not listen to this, but said they might be thankful that he had not brought in the whole conclave, to be present at the memorable event which he proposed to immortalise in his brilliant comedy. The player laughed, left him to his occupation, and returned to his own, which was studying a part in a new play. The poet, after having committed to writing some verses of his magnificent comedy, slowly and gravely drew from his pocket some morsels of bread, and about twenty raisins, or perhaps not so many, for there were some crumbs of bread among them, which increased their apparent number. He blew the crumbs from the raisins, and ate them one by one, stalks and all, for I did not see him throw anything away, adding to them the pieces of bread, which had got such a colour from the lining of his pocket, that they looked mouldy, and were so hard that he could not get them down, though he chewed them over and over again. This was lucky for me, for he threw them to me, saying, ""Catch, dog, and much good may it do you."" Look, said I to myself, what nectar and ambrosia this poet gives me; for that is the food on which they say these sons of Apollo are nourished. In short, great for the most part is the penury of poets; but greater was my need, since it obliged me to eat what he left.

As long as he was busy with the composition of his comedy he did not fail to visit the garden, nor did I want crusts, for he shared them with me very liberally; and then we went to the well, where we satisfied our thirst like monarchs, I lapping, and he drinking out of a pitcher. But at last the poet came no more, and my hunger became so intolerable, that I resolved to quit the Morisco and seek my fortune in the city. As I entered it, I saw my poet coming out of the famous monastery of San Geronimo. He came to me with open arms, and I was no less delighted to see him. He immediately began to empty his pockets of pieces of bread, softer than those he used to, carry to the garden, and to put them between my teeth without passing them through his own. From the softness of the bits of bread, and my having seen my poet come out of the monastery, I surmised that his muse, like that of many of his brethren, was a bashful beggar. He walked into the city, and I followed him, intending to take him for my master if he would let me, thinking that the crumbs from his table might serve to support me, since there is no better or ampler purse than charity, whose liberal hands are never poor.

After some time, we arrived at the house of a theatrical manager, called Angulo the Bad, to distinguish him from another Angulo, not a manager but a player, one of the best ever seen. The whole company was assembled to hear my master's comedy read; but before the first act was half finished, all had vanished, one by one, except the manager and myself, who formed the whole audience. The comedy was such that to me, who am but an ass in such matters, it seemed as though Satan himself had composed it for the utter ruin and perdition of the poet; and I actually shivered with vexation to see the solitude in which his audience had left him. I wonder did his prophetic soul presage to him the disgrace impending over him; for all the players—and there were more than twelve of them—came back, laid hold on the poet, without saying a word, and, had it not been for the authoritative interference of the manager, they would have tossed him in a blanket. I was confounded by this sad turn of affairs, the manager was incensed, the players very merry; and the poor forlorn poet, with great patience, but a somewhat wry face, took the comedy, thrust it into his bosom, muttering, ""It is not right to cast pearls before swine,"" and sadly quitted the place without another word. I was so mortified and ashamed that I could not follow him, and the manager caressed me so much that I was obliged to remain; and within a month I became an excellent performer in interludes and pantomimes. Interludes, you know, usually end with a cudgelling bout, but in my master's theatre they ended with setting me at the characters of the piece, whom I worried and tumbled one over the other, to the huge delight of the ignorant spectators, and my master's great gain.

Oh, Scipio! what things I could tell you that I saw among these players, and two other companies to which I belonged; but I must leave them for another day, for it would be impossible to compress them within moderate limits. All you have heard is nothing to what I could relate to you about these people and their ways, their work and their idleness, their ignorance and their cleverness, and other matters without end, which might serve to disenchant many who idolise these fictitious divinities.

SCIP
I see clearly, Berganza, that the field is large; but leave it now, and go on.

BERG
I arrived with a company of players in this city of Valladolid, where they gave me a wound in an interlude that was near being the death of me. I could not revenge myself then, because I was muzzled, and I had no mind to do so afterwards in cold blood; for deliberate vengeance argues a cruel and malicious disposition. I grew weary of this employment, not because it was laborious, but because I saw in it many things which called for amendment and castigation; and, as it was not in my power to remedy them, I resolved to see them no more, but to take refuge in an abode of holiness, as those do who forsake their vices when they can no longer practise them; but better late than never. Well, then, seeing you one night carrying the lantern with that good Christian Mahudes, I noticed how contented you were, how righteous and holy was your occupation. Filled with honest emulation, I longed to follow your steps; and, with that laudable intention, I placed myself before Mahudes, who immediately elected me your companion, and brought me to this hospital. What has occurred to me since I have been here would take some time to relate. I will just mention a conversation I heard between four invalids, who lay in four beds next each other. It will not take long to tell, and it fits in here quite pat.

SCIP
Very well; but be quick, for, to the best of my belief, it cannot be far from daylight.

BERG
The four beds were at the end of the infirmary, and in them lay an alchemist, a poet, a mathematician, and one of those persons who are called projectors.

SCIP
I recollect these good people well.

BERG
One afternoon, last summer, the windows being closed, I lay panting under one of their beds, when the poet began piteously to bewail his ill fortune. The mathematician asked him what he complained of.

""Have I not good cause for complaint?"" he replied. ""I have strictly observed the rule laid down by Horace in his Art of Poetry, not to bring to light any work until ten years after it has been composed. Now, I have a work on which I was engaged for twenty years, and which has lain by me for twelve. The subject is sublime, the invention perfectly novel, the episodes singularly happy, the versification noble, and the arrangement admirable, for the beginning is in perfect correspondence with the middle and the end. Altogether it is a lofty, sonorous, heroic poem, delectable and full of matter; and yet I cannot find a prince to whom I may dedicate it—a prince, I say, who is intelligent, liberal, and magnanimous. Wretched and depraved age this of ours!""

""What is the subject of the work?"" inquired the alchemist.

""It treats,"" said the poet, ""of that part of the history of king Arthur of England which archbishop Turpin left unwritten, together with the history of the quest of the Sangreal, the whole in heroic measure,—part rhymes, part blank-verse; and in dactyles moreover, that is to say, in dactylic noun substantives, without any admission of verbs.""

""For my part, I am not much of a judge in matters of poetry,"" returned the alchemist, ""and therefore I cannot precisely estimate the misfortune you complain of; but in any case it cannot equal my own in wanting means, or a prince to back me and supply me with the requisites, for prosecuting the science of alchemy; but for which want alone I should now be rolling in gold, and richer than ever was Midas, Crassus, or Croesus.""

""Have you ever succeeded, Señor Alchemist,"" said the mathematician, ""in extracting gold from the other metals?""

""I have not yet extracted it,"" the alchemist replied, ""but I know for certain that the thing is to be done, and that in less than two months more I could complete the discovery of the philosopher's stone, by means of which gold can be made even out of pebbles.""

""Your worships,"" rejoined the mathematician, ""have both of you made a great deal of your misfortunes; but after all, one of you has a book to dedicate, and the other is on the point of discovering the philosopher's stone, by means of which he will be as rich as all those who have followed that course. But what will you say of my misfortune, which is great beyond compare? For two and twenty years I have been in pursuit of the fixed point; here I miss it, there I get sight of it again, and just when it seems that I am down upon it so that it can by no means escape me, I find myself on a sudden so far away from it that I am utterly amazed. It is just the same with the quadrature of the circle. I have been within such a hair's breadth of it, that I cannot conceive how it is that I have not got it in my pocket. Thus I suffer a torment like that of Tantalus, who starves with fruits all round him, and burns with thirst with water at his lip. At one moment I seem to grasp the truth, at another it is far away from me; and, like another Sisyphus, I begin again to climb the hill which I have just rolled down, along with all the mass of my labours.""

The projector, who had hitherto kept silence, now struck in. ""Here we are,"" he said, ""four complainants, brought together by poverty under the roof of this hospital. To the devil with such callings and employments, as give neither pleasure nor bread to those who exercise them! I, gentlemen, am a projector, and have at various times offered sundry valuable projects to his majesty, all to his advantage, and without prejudice to the realm; and I have now a memorial in which I supplicate his majesty to appoint a person to whom I may communicate a new project of mine, which will be the means of entirely liquidating all his debts. But from the fate which all my other memorials have had, I foresee that this one also will be thrown into the dust-hole. Lest, however, your worships should think me crack-brained, I will explain my project to you, though this be in some degree a publication of my secret.

""I propose that all his majesty's vassals, from the age of fourteen to sixty, be bound once a month, on a certain appointed day, to fast on bread and water; and that the whole expenditure, which would otherwise be made on that day for food, including fruit, meat, fish, wine, eggs, and vegetables, be turned into money, and the amount paid to his majesty, without defrauding him of a doit, as each shall declare on oath. By this means, in the course of twenty years the king will be freed from all debts and incumbrances. The calculation is easily made. There are in Spain more than three millions of persons of the specified age, exclusive of invalids, old, and young, and there is not one of these but spends at least a real and a half daily; however, I am willing to put it at a real only, and less it cannot be, even were they to eat nothing but leeks. Now does it not strike your worships that it would be no bad thing to realise every month three millions of reals, all net and clear as if they were winnowed and sifted? The plan, moreover, instead of a loss to his majesty's subjects, would be a real advantage to them; for by means of their fasts they would make themselves acceptable to God and would serve their king, and some of them even might find it beneficial to their health. The project is in every way admirable, as you must confess; the money too might be collected by parishes, without the cost of tax gatherers and receivers, those plagues and bloodsuckers of the realm.""

The others all laughed at the projector's scheme, and even he himself joined in the laugh at last. For my part I found much matter for reflection in the strange conversation I had heard, and in the fact that people such as these usually end their days in a hospital.

SCIP
That is true, Berganza. Have you anything more to say?

BERG
Two things more and then I shall have done, for I think day is beginning to dawn. One day I accompanied Mahudes to ask for alms in the house of the corregidor of this city, who is a great cavalier and a very great Christian. We found him alone, and I thought fit to take advantage of that opportunity to give him certain counsels which I had gathered from the lips of an old invalid in this hospital, who was discussing the means of saving from perdition those vagabond girls who take to a life of vice to avoid labour,—an intolerable evil demanding an immediate and effectual remedy. Wishing to impart what I had heard to the corregidor, I lifted up my voice, thinking to speak; but instead of articulate speech I barked so loudly that the corregidor called out in a passion to his servants to drive me out of the room with sticks; whereupon one of them caught up a copper syphon, which Was the nearest thing at hand, and thrashed me with it so, that I feel it in my ribs to this hour.

SCIP
And do you complain of that, Berganza?

BERG
Nay; have I not reason to complain, since I feel the pain even now; and since it appears to me that my good intentions merited no such chastisement?

SCIP
Look you, Berganza, no one should interfere where he is not wanted, nor take upon himself a business that in no wise is his concern. Besides, you ought to know, that the advice of the poor, however good it may be, is never taken; nor should the lowly presume to offer advice to the great, who fancy they know everything. Wisdom in a poor man lies under a cloud, and cannot be seen; or if by chance it shines through it, people mistake it for folly, and treat it with contempt.

BERG
You are right, Scipio; and having had the lesson well beaten into me, I will henceforth act accordingly. That same night I entered the house of a lady of quality, who had in her arms a little lap-dog, so very diminutive that she could have hid it in her bosom. The instant it saw me, it flew at me out of its mistress's arms, barking with all its might, and even went so far as to bite my leg. I looked at it with disgust, and said to myself, ""If I met you in the street, paltry little animal, either I would take no notice of you at all, or I would make mince meat of you."" The little wretch was an example of the common rule—that mean-souled persons when they are in favour are always insolent, and ready to offend those who are much better than themselves, though inferior to them in fortune.

SCIP
We have many instances of this in worthless fellows, who are insolent enough under cover of their masters' protection; but if death or any other chance brings down the tree against which they leaned, their true value becomes apparent, since they have no other merit than that borrowed from their patrons; whilst virtue and good sense are always the same, whether clothed or naked, alone or accompanied. But let us break off now; for the light beaming in through those chinks shows that the dawn is far advanced.

BERG
Be it so; and I trust in heaven that to-night we shall find ourselves in a condition to renew our conversation.

The licentiate finished the reading of this dialogue, and the Alferez his nap, both at the same time. ""Although this colloquy is manifestly fictitious,"" said the licentiate, ""it is, in my opinion, so well composed, that the Señor Alferez may well proceed with the second part.""

""Since you give me such encouragement, I will do so,"" replied the alferez, ""without further discussing the question with you, whether the dogs spoke or not.""

""There is no need that we should go over that ground again,"" said the licentiate. ""I admire the art and the invention you have displayed in the dialogue, and that is enough. Let us go to the Espolon,[65] and recreate our bodily eyes, as we have gratified those of our minds.""

""With all my heart,"" said the alferez, and away they went.

Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go

[Brian Greenway: Guitar Solo]

Shadows movin' without a sound
From the hold of the sleepless town
Evil seems to be everywhere
Heed the spirit that brought despair
Trouble's comin' without control
No-one's stayin' that's got a hope
Hurricane at the very least
In the words of the gypsy queen

Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go

Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go

Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go",April Wine,1981,"[100, 96, 81, 57, 59, 67, 77, 87]",8
288,What Cha' Gonna Do For Me,"[Verse 1]
All night and day
Just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend
The time that I spend alone

The time that you lose
Exploiting the blues
Won't get the job done
As hard as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you

[Chorus]
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
When the chips are down

[Verse 2]
In the cool of the night
When nothing seems right
The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true

If you try to conceal
The way that you feel
You're asking for trouble
Just as sure as I cry
I'm keeping my eye on you

[Chorus]
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
When the chips are down

What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
When the chips are down

[Verse 3]
You don't have to tell me
I'm to blame for this
'Cause what you hold against me
Is what I miss",Ned Doheny,1981,"[91, 77, 64, 53, 55, 61, 70, 79, 87]",9
289,Say What,"[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, ""Damn, Drake fly""
And he just be like, ""Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em""
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, ""'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill""
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real

[Outro]
Yeah, that's all I can say",Drake,1981,"[94, 68, 37, 32, 32, 35, 37, 43, 53, 66, 77, 87]",12
290,Another Ticket,"[Verse 1]
Why can't it stay like this forever?
Why does it always have to change?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you think you've paid the price
Seems you've always got to pay it twice
Every time you think you're near the end
You turn around and find another ticket

[Chorus]
Oh my love, time is running out
Oh my love, time is running out

[Verse 2]
Why must we wait until tomorrow
When we already know the score?

Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm all right
That I ain't gonna die

Is a hole in the ground

With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head

We'll kick it when I hit the ground
Tell my friends I’m coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground

When I hit the ground

They business minded, but they in the wrong line of biz
Cause they busy minding mine instead of minding theirs

Doing that thing that I like ain’t gon’ get you no less
You a G, but that letter don’t fit you the best
Girl you got all them curves, so bitch you an S

294,I Can Take Care Of Myself,"Your wardrobe's purchased at the latest boutique
Your place is furnished like the President's suite
Your freezer's filled up with the finest of meat
Somehow you manage on a hundred a week

They say you like to feel white gold on your neck
They say when you make love you like to direct
And that new sports car you proceeded to wreck
They say I ought to ask who picked up the check

I can take care of myself
My friends all say I ought to think twice
I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
You're so nice

Attempts to charm you met with little success
I never met someone so hard to impress
Until one day by chance you saw my address
The next day you had on your lowest cut dress

I can take care of myself
My friends all say I ought to think twice
I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
You're so nice

They could be correct in their judgment of you
Maybe you'll take me and make me a fool
But I'm a big boy and I know what to do
It might be worth it to wake up next to you

I can take care of myself
My friends all say I ought to think twice
I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
You're so nice

I can take care of myself

295,Morning Train (Nine To Five),"I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
He's always on that morning train

297,Arc Of A Diver,"She bathes me in sweetness
I cannot reveal
For sharing dreams
I need my woman

This humble expression
Meagerly dressed
My eyes so mean
It has no meaning

But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate

I play the piano
No more running honey
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me

To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
I'm stronger, I'm stronger

Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up

Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here

But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate

This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me

To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer

Spawned on the streets
I hear it but with you
I had to go

'Cause my rock 'n' roll
Is putting on weight
And the beat it goes on

Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up

Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here

But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate

With you my love
We're going to raid the future
With you my love
We're going to stick up the past

We'll hold today to ransom

[Intro]
(Talking)
Uh, Hahaha, Uh
Only I can get away with something like this
Y'all know my name

[Verse 1]
I'm an uptown boy with Soho flava
The beat is D minor but I'm oh so major
I do my own thing so I owe no favors
Can't do it now then I won't do it later
Haters wanna see the boy get lost in the sauce
But it's gravy so boy get lost
Nah I ain't cocky I'm just stating the obvious
H-O the boss and I'm making his pockets rich
Hate it or not I am great and about to get greater
Hit the Peja like I play with Stojakovic
I keep it real and my ladies do the same
High class chicks that be crazy in the brain
Style so mean, swag is vicious
Smile O.D, ass delicious
Stay getting money no need for ebay
My heart is Harlem world, but I'm loving BK

[Hook]
I ain't got no problem wit girls out in Harlem but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
See I had a dope fling wit a girl on Queens but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but
(They ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
(Damn sure ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)
(D-Damn sure ain't nothing like a Brooklyn girl)

[Verse 2]
My girl Angie can't be a groupie or whore
She bout getting money in her juicy couture
Do she get bored with the Gucci of course
So the Louis she sports til it ain't new anymore
Then she cop another one makin hoes gettin madder
Gettin more money so the price don't matter
Ain't seen her in a minute know her ass got fatter
And if you think she bad then her friends are way badder
Kendra's a Christian never seen freakin
In church every weekend she need to be deacon
Had a model bitch name Viva we ain't speakin
But I had her screamin whenever I was beatin
She been callin, creepin, crawlin
Maybe she would chill if I would beat it often
And Rhonesha's fly and she sweeter than Splenda
Cause no one ever slows her agenda

(Hook)

[Verse 3]
As we smoke da la la la
BK gettin money no 9-5
Mamase mamasa mamakusa
It don't make sense but admit it, it's kinda hot
BK girls down wit that ride or die
So I always keep one right by my side
See I love New York I ain't gotta lie
So if you messin wit my ladies it's homicide
I gotta friend named Shayna
She like Bill Bellamy and how to be a player
Shorty is a player can't nobody play her
Can't nobody game her cause she ain't a gamer
Baby girl ballin kinda like the Lakers
If you would trade her like Shaq then see ya later
Player she do it so easy it's kinda like a layup
She could lay up wit your boy wit no make up
Keep doin her and I'mma keep doin me
Even on the road I'mma keep 2 or 3
Bad BK chicks that speak fluently
In the Hamilton language girl speak to me please
I remember when I couldn't get a girl for shit
Now I can't get rid of any girl for shit
So when they look at me I don't look away
I spread love it's the Brooklyn way
Now let the hook play

And I know that motor wagon is ready to fly

And you know some good ol' boys are ready to ride

Gonna push the clouds away, let the music have its way
Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm a-goin'

Outside, they're ringing, the night train is bringin' me home
When you hear that locomotion, get ready to ride

How it would be
If I could live without you

Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time, 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on

I call you on the telephone
My voice too rough with cigarettes
I sometimes think I should just go home
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets
I love to hear you say my name

But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex (Hmmmm)

I want those feeble minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture -- I just like your nose

I don't really mind how much you love me
Ooh, a little is alright
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight, tonight

When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet

I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying ""you better""
You better bet your life

You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now

[Verse 3]
I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I am so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier (oooh ooh)
I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometime (oooh ooh)
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I am giving
I have got it all down to a tee
And it's free

Hates that I said all those things to you and

Bigger than Yonge Street
Tell everyone we meet

Move a little closer
Just give me the green light

No party scenes takin' up my time
They don't mean nothin'
Nothin' to me
Jacks and kings don't impress my queen
I'm comin' up aces every time I'm played

So c'mon baby
You can lean on me
Just give me the green light

See the steel mills fire
Watch the traffic burn
Let's stay home tonight
And hide away from this world

318,You Like Me Don't You,"I remember when we met
Your eyes I can't forget
They told me a lot about you
From the look upon your face
This feeling I could trace
Girl ???? needed love
That smile you gave from my hello
Would light up my world all aglow
I just kept my cool

When you put your hand in mine
I knew that it was time
To let you know how I feel
When you kissed me by surprise
I got buterflies
Swiming around in my soul out of control
The kiss was so warm and so pure
Let's me know what I feel is for sure
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me
Don't you, Don't you

Girl you gave me many signs
I knew it all the time
When you first looked at me baby
You like me don't you
Girl you like me don't you
Oh I know what I feel is real
Girl I wasn't sure what to say to you
If I'm wrong I'm going to say it anyways
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me
Don't you

My mind didn't play tricks on me
I'm sure as sure can be
What I saw in your eyes was for real
That smile you gave from my hello
Would light up my world all aglow
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me
Don't you

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me

319,I Loved 'em Every One,"I've known some painted ladies that sparkled in the light
Country girls that loved the lovers moon
Some I never really knew, though I always wanted to
Some I only met once in a room

Some said they liked my smile, others of 'em stayed a while
While others left me on the run
This is the only way, only way I have to say
I loved 'em every one

Big, little or short or tall, wish I could've kept them all
I loved 'em every one
Like to thank 'em for their charms, holdin' me in their arms
And I hope they had some fun

Here's to the ladies in saloons and living rooms
Summer nights that lasted until dawn
Here's to the memories, everyone's a part of me
Oh, I loved 'em every one

Big, little or short or tall, wish I could've kept them all
I loved 'em every one
Like to thank 'em for their charms, holdin' me in their arms
And I hope they had some fun

You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it

Break the charm

I'll catch you
Destroy all that is keeping you down
And then I'll nurse you
I'll nurse you

Make that move right now, baby
So many times
By holding back I let the good things pass me by

And like an answer from above you came into my life

With love nothing is certain
You got to go for it when you feel it
Everybody, everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you, baby, so let's
Make that move right now, baby
You only go out once in a lifetime
Make that move right now, baby

Give in to feelings deep inside when love is due

Everybody, everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you, baby, so let's

323,Her Town Too,"[Verse 1]
She's been afraid to go out
She's afraid of the knock on her door
There's always a shade of a doubt
She can never be sure

[Verse 2]
Who comes to call?
Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend
Anyone at all
Anything but nothing again

[Chorus] [x2]
It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too

[Verse 3]
Seems like even her old girlfriends
Might be talking her down
She's got her name on the grapevine
Running up and down the telephone line

[Verse 4]
Talking 'bout someone said someone said something 'bout
Something else someone might have said about her
She always figured that they were her friends
But maybe they can live without her

[Chorus] [x2]

[Refrain 1]
Well, people gotten used to seeing them both together
But now he's gone and life goes on
Nothing lasts forever, oh no

[Verse 5]
She gets the house and the garden
He gets the boys in the band
Some of them his friends, some of them her friends
Some of them understand

[Verse 6]
Lord knows that this is just a small town city, yes
And everyone can see you fall
It's got nothing to do with pity
I just wanted to give you a call

[Chorus]
It used to be your town, it used to be my town, too
You never know until it all falls down
Somebody loves you, somebody loves you
Darling, somebody still loves you

I can still remember her
When it used to be her town, too

It used to your town, it used to be my town, too
You never know until it all falls down
Somebody loves you, somebody loves you",James Taylor,1981,"[97, 92, 72, 51, 29, 11, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 23, 29, 38]",14

Why? Why? Why?

[Verse 1: Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera, Both]
There you are in a darkened room
And you're all alone, looking out the window
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love
Like a broken arrow
Here I stand in the shadows (In the shadows)
Come to come, come to me
Can't you see that...

Run to me (Run to me) 'cause I'm dying

325,Wasn't That A Party,"[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning and whose clothes are these
I feel like shit there's lawn chairs in the tree
I live for the nights that we may not remember
Good times with friends tell me what could be better

Remember the time we snuck out on the town
Eyes real glazed hoping no one was around
Nights like this are what i crave
Say it with me now no one can stop our craze

[Chorus]
Wasn't that a party
We danced and sang the night away
We've been at this since Saturday

Wasn't that a party
I hope you'll come again my friend
These summer nights will never end

[Verse 2]
The morning after, its always the worst
Some boot and rally, some go to work
Even though we didn't know each others names
Honestly I'm the only one to blame

[Chorus]
Wasn't that a party
We danced and sang the night away
We've been at this since Saturday

Wasn't that a party
I hope you'll come again my friend
These summer nights will never end

Toe to toe dancing, very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
24 hour shopping in rapture

[Verse 2]
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ spinning I said ""My My""
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
François c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes the man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
And toe to toe, don't move too slow
Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eating bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure, take a tour
Through the sewer, don't strain your brain
Paint a train, you'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop to the punk rock

[Verse 3]
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on and now he's gone
Back up to space where he won't have a hassle
With the human race and you hip hop
And you don't stop, just blast off
Sure shot cause the man from Mars stopped eating cars
And eating bars and now he only eats guitars, get up",Blondie,1981,"[100, 93, 75, 52, 31, 14, 6, 6, 2, 2, 1, 1, 6, 7, 12, 15, 19, 32, 42, 61]",20
327,Next Time You'll Know,"[Verse 1:]
Looks like we're running out of time
Can't hide away
In nights
No longer yours or mine

All things must change
It's so painful
When nothing ever stays the same
But I must go on
While you run away from love, oh

[Chorus:]
Next time you'll know
Not to let my love go
When you feel afraid
And you can't love nobody

Next time you'll know
You must let your heart show
Till the dying day
My friend

[Verse 2:]
Maybe I hurt too easily
But is it wrong to
Feel betrayed when love can't be?

You could change your mind
No excuses could ever
Make me change mine
But I've got to be strong
And believe I'll find the love

But how can I forget
All the feelings we have shared

I can't say goodbye to you

Until you see what can be

When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

Find romance fake it
Because its all on you

Dont you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And dont you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day your way, oh your way

When theres no one left to leave you
Even you dont quite believe you
Thats when nothing can deceive you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you

Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

And that old gray wind is blowing
And theres nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going

334,One Day In Your Life,"[Verse 1]
I know that's just the way it goes
And you ain't right, for sure
You turned your back on love
For the last time
It won't take much longer now
Time makes me stronger
Well, there's nothing more to say

[Chorus]
One day in your life
Said, love will remind you
How could you leave it all behind?
One day in your life it's gonna find you
With the tears you let me cry
And, baby, I'm stronger than before
You've gotta lay it on the line
Maybe one day in your life

[Verse 2]
My love, did you think I'd break down and cry?
This thing we had, it meant the world to me
Guess I was blind
It won't take much longer now
See, time makes me stronger, well
And I know you'll be coming 'round some day

One day in your life
Said love will remind you
How could you leave it all behind?

With your velvet lines
So many sleepless nights
I wonder, is it time to say goodbye?
Ooh, yeah

Said love will remind you

335,Hurry Up And Wait,"[Verse 1]
Check it, Uhh
Most of Life is so Hurry up and Wait
That's why I love making love on the first date
If you're a slut I'm a slut, O.K
So tell them sluts you slut around but slut don't hate!

Life is so Hurry up and Wait
Like a city bus driver with the attitude that's late
In rush hour traffic
While they're standing room only
My job sucks too
Kill the attitude homie

Life is so Hurry up and Wait
That starving artist shit died in 08
I run with the sincere type, no fakes
And we work like a fixed gear bike, no brakes!
Man I'm as cold as they come
If I was holding a gun
I'd shoot a hole in the sun
And go ape shit bananas
No opposable thumbs
After the bread
Hansel and gretel
Leave a road full of crumbs

[Verse 2]
Life is so Hurry up and Wait
Man I feel like I'm Thirty Fucking Eight
I dress like I'm Eighteen still
But I act like I can't be killed
If I keep Rushin' man I could be called a Communist
I break speed limits, and laws and all my promises
But not on purpose man
I'm flawed just like all of us
And I never paid but keep yelling that god is ominous
He never answers
So I say I'm agnostic
Fuck a swagger jacker man
I'm so swagnostic
I might of accost them
Make em put on a costume
Or put some thought of what it cost em
Whenever I come across em

[Verse 3]
If I'm not the future of the west
Then the West has no future
I've met these media darlings
And they're all a bunch of losers
Living with their mommas
Dressing like their Idols
Wifing up the groupies
And getting suicidal
Like Sean Kingston
Why the same chicks are in my living room
Shot drinking with their twats leaking
And me I'm just trying to hook my neighbor up
Man
It get's annoying like a paper cut

But Life is so Hurry up and Wait
Fuck it I might as well kill em off and ate
Or release 6 mile
Like a race track 9
At a feast fixed night
With him squirming vermin
Leeches mice rats and fleas
With an upper lip
Stiff like an atrophy
These cats asleep
Passioned eased
Snicker helping fashion
Fiends jacking off
With the jacket sleeves
Acid please

Hearts can be blind to love gone astray
Always it's the same old song

340,Lately,"[Intro: Witt Lowry]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
Lately, I been reminded, they say that time's of the essence
You pulled me deep from the trenches, I guess we're here for confessions
And lately, I been reminded that love is patient and blind
I could write a million lines and never find the words to define us
I know it's best not to rush
I know you're unsure of your worth, I know how deep that can cut
He broke you down, so you don't feel much, there's forty-thousand strings
Holding back our past precaution, not often I let you in
It's not often you let me in, I get it, I mean why would you to
Take a chance on me then? I get it, I mean why should you?
'Cause me, I'm just a waiter with lucid dreams of the music
And you, you could find any guy, open mind in a student
I say it, in case we lose it, I hope that that never happens
I know our love runs deeper than just lust and attraction
I guess it's all the little things lately that make me think
I remember nights by the beach and us laughin' 'til we can't breathe
Or that CVS down the street, I don't know if you would agree
But I think

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry]
Lately, I been reminded that love is all that is timeless
The pain you paint on your face, I see strength behind both your eyelids
And lately I been reminded, I'm flawed, and nobody's perfect
The distance isn't easy, but nothin' is when it's worth it
I'm workin' to bring your wall down, I sense the weight that you carry
I wish you would let it all out and trust me, because I can't see
I wish you wouldn't compare me, he loved you without your clothes
But no, he's never seen you naked, never seen into your soul
And I love the way I see your mind wander when I get deep with you
I wonder why you cry when I tell you that I believe in you
I wish that I could take away the pain of how he treated you
My favorite nights were nights when it felt like it were just me and you
Damn, and if you ever cannot stand me
I hope that I made an impact and showed your heart what love can be
Envision us with a family, envision us where it's sandy
I feel you bringin' me closer in love with lovin' what can be
I know

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

[Verse 3: Witt Lowry]
I think about the nights you cried as you reminisce on your parents
And the way you know that money can't buy love is apparent
You're self-conscious of your ears, your hair's always down when you wear it
And you know I never drink when I'm Saké drunk, it's apparent
I know, I just love watching you grow, you feel the weight on my soul
I always mess with a temp, I'm always hot when you're cold
And if they told us our love was just for a season
I want you to know I loved you, I gave my all and I mean it
I know…

Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves

You and I now that's a hot couple
When it's off in the same club
Now you askin' for nothing but trouble

Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggas cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' it still

The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me

Slim Shady, Oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
From a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
So step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I say to the girl, I'm like, ""What up, girl? Shut up, girl!""
Then I showed her a cut up squirrel
She screamed ""bloody murder"" so loud everybody heard her
She slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon
""Yo, baby, what are you on?""
I looked at 'em both and I was like, ""Look
Check this out, toots, I'm lookin' for Cookie Puss
I need to speak to him immediately
They played my video on MTV last week""
And just when I was thinking I was all that and then some
Here comes Fred Durst, ""Now Shady, let me get some""

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead the girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose, I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick
Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me, wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no, he insisted we should go
And before I could drop him, Shady had to clock him
The music stopped, the party stood in shock
I looked around, grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

[Hook]
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you...

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Turn me loose
You better tell them to come reshingle the roof
‘Cause just keep giving me free drinks 'til I puke
Then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sitting at the bar and I'm not being approached
‘Cause Fred's over there stealing all of my hoes
""Yo, Fred, save me some""
I walked to these siamese twins
And asked to have a threesome
I told them two heads are better than one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up, like, ""Wait, where are you goin'?!""
Well, three strikes and I'm out
And I just struck out two times in a row (Ow!)
I ain't trying no more, fuck it, I'm chillin'
Did a shot of Jäger, fell asleep on the ceiling

[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead the girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose, I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick

Pour myself a cup of ambition

Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...
They let you dream
Just to watch them shatter
You're just a step
On the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day
Your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn
An' it's all gonna roll you away

9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life
And you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

What a fucking shame
And the devil left me stranded
When I called his name
Nothing hit me harder till I saw her face
Till I saw her face

I don't think I can stop it
And I know that it might hurt
But I can't do without it

Losing sleep, I toss and I turn
I wonder if you're aware
That I'm thinking of you, can't you see
You're the only one in my fantasy

Ooh-ooh, it must be heaven in your arms
I don't doubt it now
Ooh-ooh, it must be heaven in your arms
I need to know it now
Ooh-ooh, it must be heaven in your arms
Oh yeah

I'm alone, don't want no one else
I roam the streets of the city
I call you up from the payphone nearby
But you say you're too busy

You gotta run out in the night
Come my way, I'll hold you tight

Ooh-ooh, it must be heaven in your arms
I don't doubt it now
Ooh-ooh, it must be heaven in your arms
I need to know, whoa

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Ooh, I can live forever
In a moment of your love
You said I seem like a long lost, lonely boy
But you know what I'm in need of (it must be heaven in your arms)
It must be heaven in your arms (must be heaven in your arms)
Ooh, it must be heaven in your arms (must be heaven in your arms)
It must be heaven in your arms (must be heaven in your arms)

Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life quietly fading away

All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that, mommy?
*Beep*
Hi, daddy, how you doing? This is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night, mm
You actin' like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all of that
But you trying to tell me it wasn't good?
*Beep*
That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up with my girl and shit
You fucked her every time you see her
You don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you
""Why the fuck B.I.G. don't want me?""
*Beep*
Yo, B.I.G., this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that
*Beep*
Yeah, motherfucker, this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me
You be disappearing and shit, I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call, alright?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit (See shit)
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡Ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a four-four
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G, you see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back

[Chorus: Total & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?

Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me?
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with Benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York?
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo, I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I nut I got to split
Shit, backshots is my position
I got you wishing for an intermission, fuck the kissin'
Lickin' you down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me big for nuttin' all of a sudden

Living on a lighted stage
Approaches the unreal

In touch with some reality

Cast in this unlikely role
Ill-equipped to act
With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers

Caught in the camera eye
I have no heart to lie

And we are merely players
Performers and portrayers
Each another's audience
Outside the gilded cage

I got a unicorn that shits rainbows
From a father that loves face fucking lions
Oh, I got a squad full of ninjas
And that's a gang of gods on a Nimbus
Zenned out and playing with lightning
Unplugged, eating cake on a bison
See with this I can float above the atlas
And make it rain multicoloured acid
Magic, it's happening right now
Imagine a world where you finally defeat the dragon
But on the real, no jokes
I nearly died tryna live this life
Now all I think about now, is how many blessings I can give my tribe
And raise my seed off love, compassion, and empathy
Let them know that his soul is golden and we all hold that magical energy
Oh yeah, there it is I can feel it
That's what happens when you're dealing with the real shit
Fuck a beer I'll be happy to order
Some teriyaki chicken and a gallon of water

Somehow, we'll be lovers after all

In time we'll learn to understand
The meaning of together, my love

If we keep walking hand in hand
Then nothing else will matter

There will be no need to hide
Feelings that we keep inside

374,Right Away,"[Verse 1]
Well I was packing bags like a bat out of hell
And you were slipping on your dress
I was punching holes in a ticket to downtown mass
Where the spirit fled
Away from my body and away from my blood
Like a fire that we never lit
Have you ever seen a man so broken as that
One man that you are looking at
No, no

[Verse 2]
I could try again if you wanted me to
I swear I'd be a better man
If roses and daises won't do the trick
I'll create another perfect plan
I swear to the heavens I'll forget all the past
Just say that you need me again
Have you ever seen a man so broken as that
One man that you won't write back
Oh, I just need you, my river
Oh, I just need you, my love
Oh

[Verse 3]
You are looking east with the heaviest heart
That I can ever recall seeing
Time is not the answer you wanted
But time is what you're going to get
Have you ever seen a man burn brighter with love
Than the man that you are looking at
The answer is no, no, no
The answer is no
No, no, it's no

Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day

Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this
Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
I might just, might just, I don't know
Reinvention, that's my intention
Want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, I’m being real with ya
But it will hit ya like, ""goddamn!""
Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, I’m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life—no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

They gon' know my name until it fade—

377,Guitar Man,"[Verse 1]
Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
I left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went hunting them nights
Just looking for a place to play
Well, I thought my picking would set them on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

[Verse 2]
Well, I nearly about starved to death down in Memphis
I run out to money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started picking out some of them all night bars
Hoping I could make myself a dollar
Making music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There is no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son

[Verse 3]
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jamming
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed them what a band would sound like
With a swinging little guitar man
Show them, son

[Verse 4]
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Digging the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leading that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't you know, it's that swinging little guitar man

[Verse 5]
Well, I came a long way from the car wash
Got to where I said I'd get
Now that I'm here I know for sure
I really have not got there yet
Think I'll start all over
Swing my guitar over my back
I'm going to get myself back on the track
I'll never, never ever look back
I'll never be more than what I am
Wouldn't you know
I'm a swinging little Guitar man",Elvis Presley,1981,"[99, 80, 67, 65, 28, 28, 30, 32, 36, 43, 48, 54, 65, 77]",14

380,I Have The Skill,"[Verse 1]
Man, I think I’m changing
But it’s prolly a good thing
I don’t have a filter no more
I’m seeing red on my mood ring
I used to try to argue witcha
When I disagreed with your opinion
But when I step back and look at the world
It’s still gonna keep spinning
Now when anybody says some shit
That I don’t like, I listen and try to respect it
So I won’t attempt to destroy your viewpoint
I’ve erased that bullet from my checklist
Try to get along, so when I write a song
Like this, I only want to offer perspective
And I think we forget, we can never get
Closer to the truth, if we can’t be objective
I hate to be the one to break it
But humans take things in
The way they wanna take it
They adjust the story, and things they perceive
To fit in with ideas they believe
The past is a mystery, look
What will it say in the history books?
Mike Brown was a zero? Huh?
Darren Wilson a hero?
The people in Ferguson were just a buncha thugs right?
What woulda happened if he was white?
He suddenly isn't innocent
If his skin isn’t light?
I guess it isn’t
None of my business, aight
But I'll be God damned if I sit on the sofa
Rather than get up on my soap box
And see innocent black men
Get choked out and cold-cocked
And maybe it’s time we start to throw rocks
Cause we ain’t living in a glass house
If you’re telling me you wouldn’t fuckin' lash out
You prolly missed the video where Eric Gardner passed out
And you’re telling me it’s part of the past now?
Nope
We gotta make shit right, dude
Maybe you’ll get the point if you hear it from a white dude
They ain’t doing it just to spite you
You gotta re-write the book, before you let it write you

[Chorus]
So I don’t mean to stir no shit
When I address some things, like I’m about to
Cause when it comes to honesty
I just can’t shut my mouth dude
I really don’t know how to
I really don’t know how to
I really don’t know how to
Cause when it comes to honesty
I just can’t shut my mouth dude
I really don’t know how to

[Verse 2]
Now, There’s a little bit of good in everyone
But there’s a little bitty, bullet, in every gun
Now there’s 3,000 homeless, living in Rome
Every day, praying to God, to save our souls
By the Vatican, but are we giving em homes?
Cause the Catholic Capitol, is made of gold
You get what I’m saying, holmes?
Now it isn’t necessarily the fault of a person
It’s more a concern of society
But how can you expect a man not to question
An institution that done nothing but lie to me?
How the Hell do we make progress
When they got 40-year terms in Congress?
Give a fuck about the people in the projects
Any more than the money in their pockets?
""Dead presidents, in my wallet
Any residents in my knowledge?""
I figured that one out with a high school diploma
It don’t take no 4 years of college
And I won’t dish no apologies
Will you disagree with me?
Probably
But I’m feeling like the truth has been locked in a box
With me, and they forgot the key
This here, is that real shit
Just cause it isn't happening to you it isn't real shit
We really care about ourselves so much that we don't feel shit
We know the truth, but we conceal it
Out of sight, out of mind, right?
But if it's really out of sight, we must be blind, right?
Cause that man in the mirror
Is just as bad
If he can’t bring his thoughts into the limelight

[Chorus]
So I don’t mean to stir no shit
When I address some things, like I’m about to
Cause when it comes to honesty
I just can’t shut my mouth dude
I really don’t know how to
I really don’t know how to
I really don’t know how to
Cause when it comes to honesty
I just can’t shut my mouth dude

386,Hold On,"[Verse 1]
Loving and fighting
Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Verse 2]
Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Bridge]
I don't wanna let go
I know I'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you
Saying ""baby, let's go home""
Let's go home
Yeah, I just wanna take you home

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you",Chord Overstreet,1981,"[99, 92, 70, 56, 56, 66, 76, 86]",8

And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say
Know what we mean
We're all American girls

The day has finally come
We're reaching out for number one

It was a fight just to survive
You`d better get this straight

Wise up
Before it's too late
We`re not threatened by your lies
Or your goodbyes

We're all American girls
Sometimes the struggle gets rough
You give your all
But it`s not enough
A vacant job at the top

That right you`re not

So long rehearsed

Give us an equal share

392,Same Old Lang Syne,"[Verse 1]
Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

[Verse 2]
She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

[Verse 3]
We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged

[Verse 4]
Went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

[Chorus]
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

[Verse 5]
She said she'd married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie

[Verse 6]
I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I
Saw doubt or gratitude

[Verse 7]
She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell

[Chorus]
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another 'auld lang syne'

[Verse 8]
The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away

[Verse 9]
Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain

And feel the need to be adored

394,Proud,"[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?

[Verse 2]
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

401,(Ghost) Riders In The Sky,"[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 1]
An old cowpoke went ridin' out
One dark and windy day (yippie-I-ay)
Upon a ridge he rested
As he went along his way
When all at once a mighty bunch
Of red eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 2]
Their brands were still on fire
And their hoofs were made of steel (yippie-I-ay)
Their horns were black and shiny
And the hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
As they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders commin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 3]
Their faces gaunt
Their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat (yippie-I-ay)
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd
But they ain't caught 'em yet'
'Cause you've gotta ride forever
On that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on, hear their cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 4]
As the riders went on by him
He heard one call his name (yippie-I-ay)
If you want to save your soul
From ever ridin' on our range
Then cowboy change your way today
Or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd
Across the endless skies

405,Too Tight,"[Verse 1: MC Hammer]
Baby back up, if you asthmatic
This track'll have you going way back like bad habit
I heard you talking loud and clear you ain't saying nothing
This beat is pumping got you swerving in your ride when you play it bumpin'
I caught some player hating punks talking 'bout my style
I'm getting money doing this for a while
Bunch of immature squares using bad grammar
I hit the city have 'em screaming ""You the man Hammer""
Holla if you understand me, its new drag
Poppa got a new bag and its too bad
Come on, was getting hype in the back seat
Boom when the track meet
Me make 'em get up on they black feet
They told me Hammer wasn't popping so I changed the plan
And came back with a monster jam
Throw up your hands if you feel me, touch the sky
Cause you ain't got to be high to fly
Now what my people say

[Hook]
Everybody talking 'bout they down to ride, now that Hammer's bustin' too tight
But I don't think they know what we got tonight
Show 'em Hammer cause you're too tight

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]
You wonda' why they call me Hammer
I shake the whole state, earthquake the whole planet
I got you jumping out your chair like you're panicking
Quit being stiff its similar to watching mannequins
Throw up your hands up again and swing 'em back side to side
Hammer time in this mother sucker time to ride
Where you from Hammer? Oak Town I reside
Until I die, heart full of home town pride
Don't ask why things changed, am I still the same
Daddy never left the game, he just got strange
So peep game, cause the fame is a narcotic
The fans want to get a fix but the stars got it
And you'll be going through the stacks of junk
Packs of pumps, and still can't find a track that bumps
Well never worry cause your homie got your legs tonight
And all my people say its too tight
Now what my people say

[Hook]
Everybody talking 'bout they down to ride, now that Hammer's bustin' too tight
But I don't think they know what we got tonight
Show 'em Hammer cause we're too tight

The third verse getting worse for the wallflowers
Either hit the floor or hit the door coward
Since its a Death Row party got the cream and the crop
I keep it popping got the whole crowd screaming don't stop, until you drop
Music motivates a generation
All color barriers are broken when I rock the nation
From senior citizens to minors in the little league
From thugs and jocks, and even cops killing me
Consider me to be the one to put the love back
And can't nobody rock the show like the Hammer with a club track
And since my aim is for motion, I got a new potion
To groove you from coast to coast, so get close
Cause ain't nothing but a party y'all, we keep it going till the daylight
Cause this is too tight
Not only the women but all the men
As soon it end it start again
Now what my people say

They've got to catch me if they want me to hang

Nobody's gonna get me on another rap

Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?

He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

And though I'm shielded from the pretty faces
Their tongues still get to me

I can hear it in the way they look at me
And whisper to the others right behind my ears
Like, ""Yeah, he's kind of pretty and his songs ain't bad
But you know, I hear he is who he is

[Refrain 1]
Who he is
Who he is""

[Verse 3]
I think every woman in the world hates me
But lately I don't even need their help
See, I wonder if they might be right
It's been hard to stop myself

They say my biggest trouble seems to be patience
Oh, I never believed in wait and see
When you know you gotta go you outta go right then

So go I did
Oh, I did
Oh, I did
Oh

I got lonely this weekend
So I ran away
It just got worse the more I wandered
And the more I paid
And I saw inside those women's eyes
As I turned to hate

So until the hatred hails from someone else

Nor mark the tints the copses wear;

And constellated daisies there.

I hear not the contralto note
Of cuckoos hid on either hand,
The whirr that shakes the nighthawk's throat
When eve's brown awning hoods the land.

Some say each songster, tree, and mead -
All eloquent of love divine -
Receives their constant careful heed:
Such keen appraisement is not mine.

The tones around me that I hear,
The aspects, meanings, shapes I see,
Are those far back ones missed when near,
And now perceived too late by me!",Thomas Hardy,1981,"[91, 91, 92]",3

(coughs) I think I'm getting sick
Been in this room, like all the time

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Look, I'm posing a question
How many been empty and holding aggression?
Close to depression
Open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother
My mind is my weapon, I'm letting it go
Loading and pointing at negative energy
Telling me stop, they're telling me, ""No, don't""
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me I'd rather you not
Cause it's driving me crazy
The fact that you pay amaze me that's something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs
Drunk, fucking these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting
Why ain't you chasing your dreams, uh?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won't they give me a turn out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You're mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When 'em high roller homes in Vegas
Raid 'em with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left
You're holding your breath because you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm getting ballistic
Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers
Except I'm cool with Vader
And blowing up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on homie, we major

Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

There was a time, when we showed love
You know like how we, approach a young lady
You see a beautiful young lady you like
You say ""Damn, man, you're gorgeous""
I'll take off my coat right now and
Lay it down on the puddle and, make sure you don't miss a step

418,Flash's Theme Aka Flash,"THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of Emergency Medicine confirms it: Each year, between one and two dozen adult US males are admitted to ERs after having castrated themselves. With kitchen tools, usually, sometimes wire cutters. In answer to the obvious question, surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety. The desire for perfect release and the real-world impossibility of perfect, whenever-you-want-it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand.

It is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: “Stop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!” Because we believe we may have found an alternative.

Every spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs’ notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV’s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it’s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clichés of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.—the whole cynical postmodern deal—but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there’s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there’s still joy. That we think it’s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.

Your correspondents humbly offer an alternative.

Every January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.

Though the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter’s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA’s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood’s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream’s Big Red Son.

It is no accident that Adult Video News—a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials—and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early ’80s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.

From the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):

- The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year’s awards show, commemorating AVN’s 15th anniversary, celebrates “History”. [sic]

- Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.

- The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 “new” releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3

- By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic—meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].

From the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN’s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): “I want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.” [Laughter, cheers, ovation.]

From the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN’s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black’s Miscreants: “Jesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that’s another one where I read the script and said ‘Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that’s okay, ’cause all my friends’ll be there too!” [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]

From the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: “I know I’m looking good, though, like younger, ’cause I started using this special Grecian Formula—every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That’s a great joke. Fuck you.”

Bobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as “the woman I’m going to cut my dick off for,” and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we’d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The ’98 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he’s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men’s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998’s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men’s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them—whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth—laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.

… But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday’s climax.

The adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards’ categories is “Best Anal Themed Feature”; another is “Best Overall Marketing Campaign—Company Image.” Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry’s not only vulgar, it’s predictably vulgar. All the clichés are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who’s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone.

But of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum’s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.

Thirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN’s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.

An LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn’s yearly gross.

As you know if you’ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion’s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the “Old Vegas,” centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas’s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it’s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more “family-oriented” venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.

But Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip’s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah’s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny’s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK—WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra’s sandbox. Most of them built in the ’50s and ’60s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World’s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally’s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange—of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow’s abstract cost.

Nor let us forget Vegas’s synecdoche and beating heart. It’s kittycorner from Bally’s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It’s breathtaking. The winter’s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas’s Caesars for modern porn’s Awards show—here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you’d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn’t miss a trick.

The Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It’s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS’s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year’s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents’ hometowns. It’s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from “The First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch” to the world’s premier self-heating home satellite dish (“The Snow and Ice Solution!”).

But far and away the CES’s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer’s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn’s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night’s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies’ CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh.

The best way to describe the sonic environment at the ’98 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry’s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.

It takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video’s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:

A second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as “babe” and asks her to readjust so as to “give us a little more bush down there.” An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular “Let me out of here, I can’t wait to get out of here.”6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell—a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant—and the Sands’ former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress’s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress—an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name—has normal-size breasts, and there’s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max’s videos’ promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!” Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or “Bizarro-Sleaze” filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8

Next to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lamé spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty—she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford—and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There’s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor’s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.

The booth for XPlor Media—a company known for its “Southern Belles” video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website—is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth’s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor’s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what’s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause célèbre at the ’98 CES because he’s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday’s Awards banquet.10

Everyone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry’s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like “A porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.” Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough—winner of AVN’s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both ’96 and ’97—alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he’s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis’s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).

And 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year’s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel’s popular “Butt Row” video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today’s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, “Present”) their own line of videos, e.g. “Tom Byron’s Cumback Pussy” series, “Jon Dough’s Dirty Stories,” the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi’s “[Various European Cities] By Night” line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.

It is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you’ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we’ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers’ faces in orgasm—that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR’s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:

“Most of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,” veteran starlet Shane has explained. “I’ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.” The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation—the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro.
It is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today’s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product’s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C §2257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:

Censorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, “legal” morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.

These trailers always say they’re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the ’80s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.

Feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography’s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment’s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some “masculists” believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:

At the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image… . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a “greater” deity, a more powerful force… . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday’s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid.

This kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands’ casino, or maybe until one’s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now “in the flesh,” complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see—never want to see—in films.

Maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being… . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers’ being sidelined with something called a “prolapsed sphincter,” which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who’s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he’s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth’s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her—you turn your head to look even if you don’t seem to want to. It’s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn’t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets—they’re never alone. They’re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.

FYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire’s cult-celebrity status at the ’98 CES stems from her having broken the “World Gang Bang Record”16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures’ 1996 World’s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who’d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal—“the People’s Porn Star”—and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of tête-à-tête above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who’s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth—after your correspondents have remarked on how it’s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers—dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soirée a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you’re interested, appears as FN17 just below. Twenty feet away, over at XPlor, Mr. Farrel Timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world’s only authorized Kenny® Action Figure from the upcoming South Park merchandising line—fourteen inches tall, kind of heavy for a doll, w/ hood up and face obscured (not unlike F. Timlake’s own hood and face)—and is entertaining some of the IM crowd’s spillover by manipulating the doll’s limbs to simulate its “tok[ing] a bone.”

Not unlike urban gangs, police, carnival workers, and certain other culturally marginalized guilds, the US porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school. There are cliques, anticliques, alliances, betrayals, conflagratory rumors, legendary enmities, and public bloodlettings, plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence. You’re either In or you’re not. Performers, being the industry’s fissile core, are of course In. Despite their financial power, studio execs and producers are not very In, and directors (especially those who’ve never undergone the initiation of having on-camera sex themselves) are less In than the performers. Film reviewers and industry journalists are even less In than execs; and nonindustry journalists are way, way non-In, almost as low-caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves (for which fans the Insider term is: mook18 ).

The foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore’s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite’s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls—which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, but yr. corresps. clung almost like papooses to their backs, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn’t quick enough about slamming the door.
So yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.

For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films’ worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse—a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake—to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there’s a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore’s hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. Nevertheless the tension persists, despite the fact that the actresses are obviously tired and disassociated from the day’s CES,19 plus, it emerges, somewhat sore—it turns out that Max Hardcore is shooting one of his “Gonzo” porn spectaculars right here at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, using the CES as a hook and backdrop, and the girls have been alternating CES booth-duty and riding-crop shenanigans with a tight and SS-intensive filming schedule. (Max, being a firm believer in the fait accompli method of filmmaking, has not yet gotten around to chatting with the CES’s administration about his featuring the world’s biggest consumer-tech tradeshow by name in a “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL” video.)

Mr. Max Hardcore—a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner, né Paul Little—is 5'6"" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence), Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year’s AVN Awards, which issues are the career, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.

Pioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (“Buttman”) Stagliano, “Gonzo” has become one of this decade’s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It’s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion—Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There’s always a randy and salivous “host” talking directly to a handheld camera: “Well and we’re here at the Cannes Film Festival, and it looks like there’s going to be lots of excitement, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there’s also the world-famous beach, and I’m told there’s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach, so let’s us head on down.” (That’s the approximate lead-in to a recent Max-at-Cannes Gonzo, a type of signature lead-in that Max refers to with a 56-tooth grin as “always mercifully brief”—and please note the “little girls at the beach” thing, because this is another of Max’s professional signatures, the infantilization of his videos’ females as dramatic foils for his own film persona, which is always that of a sort of degenerate uncle or stepdad.) Then the shaky but ever-focused camera heads on down to the ocean or mall or CES or whatever, scoping out attractive women20 while the host moans and chews his knuckle in lust. Then pretty soon host and camera start actually coming up to the women they’ve been looking at and engaging them in little cameo “interviews” full of sideways leers and salacious entendres. Some of the interviewees are actual civilians, but some are always what Max refers to as “ringers,” meaning professional porn actresses. And so the viewer is treated to the classic frathouse fantasy of moving, via just a couple of singles-bar “Hey there babe” lines, from scoping out an attractive woman to having wild and anatomically diverse sex with her, all while one of his buddies captures the whole thing on tape.21

The issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team—Max’s shoots are described (by Max) as “almost military operations”; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian “little girls” on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in “mainstream” (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, after detailing for yr. correspondents the vo- and avocations that led him into the adult industry (a tale too literally incredible even to think about factchecking and trying to print), informs us that he is and always has been adult video’s “cutting-edge blade,” and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max’s, degradations of women as a blueprint for their own subsequent shabby and derivative films’ degradations.23 (Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, by the way, have heard Max hold forth many times before and are now outside the circle of discourse—D.F. in the bathroom for what seems like a peculiarly long time, H.H. on the couch with the actresses hashing out the implications of Seinfeld’s retirement for NBC’s ’98 lineup.)

Alone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite’s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine’s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the ’68 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown—there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn’t.

Asked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: “I fucking stole it.” It’s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy’s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, upon exiting the stage (he’s always a presenter every year, which he regards as the AVNAs’ way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it, “What the fuck, I fucking deserve it” and snagged one, hiding it in his enormous Stetson and deriving no little satisfaction from attending various post-Awards parties with an illicit statuette under his hat. Max’s crew all laugh very hard at this anecdote, though the actresses don’t.

Alex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then—perhaps mistaking your correspondents’ expressions for ones of disbelief—she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.

So much about today’s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the “smoldering” sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for—the vanity, the vulgarity, the rank commercialism—and not only makes them overt and grotesque but seems then to revel in that grotesquerie.

Good old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath—that’s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona—but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You’d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, while his red-suited acolytes laugh on cue and a jr. high dropout shows off her valves. In truth, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him—we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you’re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they’ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she’s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara’s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along, which eventually results in the B-girls and crewmen and yr. corresps.26 all standing there awkwardly at the maître d’s podium while Max personally conducts the starlet to her table and pulls out her chair and tucks a serviette into her cleavage and pulls out a platinum-plated money clip and announces in a voice audible to everyone in the restaurant and foyer that he “want[s] to take care of the little girl’s damages in advance” and shoves bills into the hanky-pocket of the maître d’s tuxedo and then leaves her there by herself and herds us all back out and into the elevator and jabs impatiently at the button for his suite’s floor, almost jumping up and down with fury at the elevator’s delay; and we’re all rushed back up to the suite because it’s occurred to Max that he wants to show your corresps. something from this week’s filming that he thinks will sum up his particular porn genius better than any amount of exposition could … and then, reseated, he starts flipping through a notebook to find something.

“What it is is we got this one little girl back in the [infamous MAXWORLD] trailer, and after some face-fucking27 and reaming her asshole and, like, your standard depravities, we get her to stick a pen—no, a what-do-you-call …”

Crewman: “Magic Marker.”

Max: “… Magic Marker, stick it up her asshole and write all this … this stuff,” holding up the notebook, opened to a page; again he has us pass it around:

is thereon written in a hand28 that seems impressively legible, considering. Dick Filth makes a waggish inquiry about future film plans involving this girl and a typewriter, but Max doesn’t laugh (we noticed that Max never laughs at a joke he hasn’t told), and so neither does anyone else.

Doubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it’s worth also observing—when this magazine’s assigned photographer (who’s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.’s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes—the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip—so the photographer’ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background—with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, or both. It is important to note that there are no audible scare-quotes, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max’s face as he sketches this photo’s tableau for us; he’s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max’s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max’s proposing this very photo—i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage—but the Premiere photographer, who is no actor, does such a poor job of disguising his repulsion at Max’s self-regard that the atmosphere of the whole suite gets stilted and complexly hostile, and the rest of the interview is kind of a fizzle-yield, and overall Dick Filth said that we failed, in his phrase, to “penetrate to the core of the essence of what it is to be Max Hardcore.”30

The 15th Annual AVN Awards are actually split over two consecutive nights, a tactic that Max H. thought the legit Oscars would do well to emulate: “Get all the bullshit out of the way the first night—best packaging, marketing, best gay, shit like that. Who wants to sit through that shit?”

Held in a different, slightly smaller Caesars Palace ballroom, Friday’s Awards show is indeed brisk. The ephemeral categories include Best Videography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Music. Each category’s nominees are listed in the program, but only the winners are announced onstage, and they’re announced four at a time, and applause is discouraged, and the master of ceremonies keeps telling the quartets of winners that “If you’ll come on up quickly and help keep things moving it’ll help us out a lot.” Friday’s only food is big wheels of vegetables and dip near the cash bar. The emcee is not headliner Robert Schimmel but a hypomanic guy named Dave Tyree, whose interpolated banter is 78 rpm and consists of stuff like “If God didn’t want us to jerk off he would’ve made our arms shorter.” There are maybe 1,000 people in attendance, most only slightly dressed up, and there are no assigned tables, and everybody in the ballroom is moving around and chattering and treating the onstage proceedings the way people in a cocktail lounge treat the piano player.

Q. $4,000,000,000 and 8,000 new releases a year—why is adult video so popular in this country?
A. Director and AVN-Hall-of-Fame inductee F. J. Lincoln: “It’s always a little funny how it’s called adult. What it really is, you get to be a kid again. You roll around and get dirty. It’s the adult sandbox.”
A. Veteran woodman Joey Silvera: “Dudes, let’s face it—America wants to jerk off.”
A. Industry journalist Harold Hecuba: “It’s the new Barnum. Nobody ever goes broke overestimating the rage and misogyny of the average American male.”
A. Porn starlet Jacklyn Lick: “I think a lot of fans are very lonely people.”
Q. There don’t seem to be a whole lot of condoms used in hard-core scenes.
A. Harold Hecuba: “Never have been. They’re viewed as a turn-off. This business is about engineering fantasies.”
Q. But even just venerially—all these anal shenanigans and everything. Is there much worry in the industry about HIV?
A. Harold Hecuba: “There’s not as much worry about AIDS now. Everybody gets tested on a schedule.”
Q. What about herpes?
A. H.H.: “I think it’s rampant.”

Last year’s Best-Sex-Scene-in-a-Film winner Vince Vouyer’s real name turns out to be John LaForme. Rhetorical Q.: How, if one’s real name was John LaForme, could that person possibly feel the need for a nom de guerre?

Mr. Tom Byron describes being able to tumesce and ejaculate more or less on demand as an exercise in “control, like meditation or surfing. It’s like a gymnast staying on the balance beam. You practice enough, you can do anything.”31

Former woodman and current auteur Paul Thomas was a member of the original Broadway cast of Jesus Christ Superstar.

The tall, crazed-looking, and ever-rampant Mike Horner, three-time Best Actor winner and a member of the AVN Hall of Fame,32 is actually a classically trained opera singer.

Deceased starlet Nancy Kelly’s real name was Kelly Van Dyke. She was the daughter of TV’s Jerry Van Dyke and so, of course, the niece of Dick.

Exotic rookie actress Midori, one of the nominees in the ’98 AVNAs’ Best New Starlet category, is the sister of ’80s pop star Jodi Whatley. Midori has stated publicly that she views upscale contemporary porn as a stepping-stone to a mainstream career, not unlike becoming Miss America or doing a couple seasons on SNL. Harold Hecuba characterizes Midori’s career strategy as “grievously ill-advised.”

Adult Video News VP and Executive Editor Gene Ross, presenting the aforementioned 1998 AVN Award for Best Director/Video to Miscreants’ Rob Black, will hail Mr. Black as “a guy who can take buttholes, midgets, and fried fish, and make a love story.”33

From The New Yorker’s 1995 article on the psychosexual plight of the adult industry’s woodman: “The Cal Jammers who are part of this feminization feel they have stormed the walls of female ornament to reclaim male prerogative, only to find themselves lost in a garden of gender irony.”

Mr. John “Buttman” Stagliano—CEO of Evil Angel Inc., a man described by US News & World Report as “the nation’s leading director of hard-core videos”—not only has publicly announced testing positive for HIV but has identified the infection’s vector as a transsexual prostitute in São Paulo with whom Stagliano had unprotected anal intercourse in 1995. He’s anxious that people not get the wrong idea: “I am not particularly interested in guys, but I am interested in dicks. Forbidden taboos lead to all sorts of neurotic behavior, which leads to me being fucked in the ass without a rubber.”

Are the AVN Awards possibly rigged? Max Hardcore (he of the purloined statuette, keep in mind) calls the Awards “a total conflict of interests.” After all, he explains, Adult Video News is heavily ad-dependent,34 and they’re under “pressure from the big hitters like Vivid and VCA to like, you know, give the nod.”

Ms. Ellen Thompson, AVN Associate Editor and an Awards judge who votes under the n.d.g. Ida Slapter:35 “We’ve heard this for years. I hear this complaining also goes on in the mainstream. I don’t like insulting anybody, but sometimes there’s sour grapes. What are we supposed to say? Vivid and VCA put out good product. We truly, honestly do vote fairly.”

Mr. Dick Filth: “The best perception, backed up by tons of anecdotal evidence, is that they are totally, totally fixed and rigged.”
Saturday’s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES, and they are seriously dolled up. There are cerise halters and pear-colored Lycra bodysuits with open-toed pumps of burgundy suede. There are platinum lamé gowns slit all the way to the tenth rib. Bottoms less covered than shellacked look like they by all rights should have panty- or at least thong lines but do not have such lines. There are lime-green vinyl leotards and toile bellbottoms and fishscale bustiers and miniskirts the same texture and length as a tutu’s ruffle. Garter straps flash and Merry Widow bodices shade the interiors of translucent blouses. Several of the outfits defy very basic precepts of modern physics. Coiffures are towering and complex. The starlets are all on the arms of men, but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4""+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase “Va Va Voom,” which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl—arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that’s mostly fringe—has inflated her breasts to what’s got to be maximum capacity.

Woodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there’s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk à la British punks of the late 1970s.

Inside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace’s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we’d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it’s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone’s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes, several of the male Insiders—including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi—are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry’s elite woodmen are short—5'6"", 5'7""36 —and most of their companions tower over them. Dick Filth confirms that the contemporary industry’s 5'6"" standard helps a prodigious male organ look even more prodigious on videotape, a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.

Tickets for Saturday’s main event are $195 per, in advance. It’s unclear whether any Insiders’ tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it’s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket, tonight’s attendance can confidently be fixed at 2,500.
The Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the—as it were—joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards’ audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is “The History of Adult”) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.

Both Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.’s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom’s L’s northern leg, hundreds of yards from even the nearest video screen. “They always put the print guys out in mookland,” Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice, have brought in their own picnic hampers.

Now moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts’ fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously, the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4"" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house, accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, who is here to receive a Special AVN Achievement Award for His Lifelong Defense of the First Amendment. Black is so resoundingly In this year that even the starched linen napkins at everyone’s place settings are black. The wineglasses all have little frosted cameos of J. Caesar on them. Humorless men with walkie-talkies stand guard at each of the ballroom’s fire doors—apparently last year there were some problems with unauthorized Caesars Palace employees sneaking in to watch the gala. The video screens are now showing the climactic scene of Debbie Does Dallas, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes “NEXT?” The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41

The closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba’s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic), who himself is not up for many ’98 Awards because he spent a good part of the past year in court and/or detention for helping operate an escort service which authorities alleged was not a bona fide escort service at all.

It turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can’t run any sort of tab—you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, with additional complications if certain people are buying drinks for certain tablemates but not for certain other tablemates, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom’s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure, who are taking some serious abuse about the pay-as-you-go beverage policy from mooks with cigars at the nearby tables, despite the fact that the waiters don’t make the rules and must surely find having to remember and make change for six to eight different customers per table a piercing pain in the ass44 ) have only rudimentary ESL skills and tend to confuse both drink orders and currency denominations. Dick Filth leans over and shouts: “Now you can maybe see why this is a multibillion-a-year industry—they’re tight as a duck’s butt!”45

The crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners’ serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:

“Fellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!” intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he’s long deserved. “I want to thank my mother, who spread her legs and made all this possible.” Large sections of the crowd are on their feet—Goldstein is a porn icon. He was distributing NYC’s Screw on photostat when most of the people in this room were still playing with their toes. He’s been a First Amendment ninja. He drinks in the applause and loves it and is hard not to sort of almost actually like. He’s clearly an avatar of contemporary porn’s unabashedness, its modern Yeah-OK-I’m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:

“I salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They’re the real heroes.” Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.

This has followed Robert Schimmel’s intro and a 20-minute “Musical Salute to the History of Adult,” in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified, and they all have flared collars and tight perms—it’s like watching The Brady Bunch’s final season through borrowed binoculars. The stage is lit by autotrack spotlights whose colors alternate w/o discernible scheme.

The whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don’t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures’ Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, gets repeatedly pronounced “Satter.” Winners are supposed to exit stage-left after their acceptance speeches, but even people who’ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters—not many, but some—who are obviously coked to the gills.

Probably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them “an opening” or “a shot” or “my big shot” and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists’ table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who’s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show’s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN’s Gene Ross pays tribute to ’98’s Male Performer of the Year by saying: “You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Tom Byron’s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.” Rob Black’s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there’s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48

To be fair, some of the nominated products’ titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene—along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin’—but loses out to a scene the Program entitles “Anal Food Express”49 from a video called My Girlfriend’s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas’s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel’s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, and Best Anal Sex Scene/Film50 for Lauren and Steven St. Croix. Best Compilation Tape honors go to The Voyeur’s Favorite Blow Jobs & Anals. David Cronenberg’s mainstream Crash comes out of absolutely nowhere to win something called Best Alternative Adult Feature Film. Ms. Stephanie Swift wins Best Actress/Video and tells the crowd: “Thanks, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.”51

Max Hardcore, to Table 189’s immense and unkind delight, doesn’t win one single thing.

An actor named Jim Buck wins AVN’s Gay Performer of the Year Award, and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10"" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears, even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It’s Jim Buck’s little brother. “Jim can’t be here tonight because he’s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans,” the little boy says (correspondential expressions of bug-eyed inquiry at Hecuba and Filth—Shakespeare festival? sending a prepubescent relative to collect your excellence-in-filmed-sodomy prize?—are met with bemused shrugs), “but I’m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.” [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]

A strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men’s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum’s men’s room’s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:

“Found this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can’t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.”

“You going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?”

“Nah. That’s the whole point. I’m the director. This is my package now.”

“Oh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big” [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].

“Well, we’ll see.” [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.]

The Awards Show’s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars’ feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end—though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 —but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr’actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition “Psycho Magnet,” a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song’s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, but Ms. Lauren struts and contorts and punctuates her phrasing with uppercuts to the air like a genuine MTV diva. The downside is that vocally, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette, and H. Hecuba chimes in by shouting: “Say whatever you want about the song-and-dance numbers here, they sure beat what Wahlberg and Reilly were coming up with in Boogie Nights!”

Hecuba’s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as “Doctor Dirty—the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,” proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. “Just got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin’./Goo goo goo drippin’ out my back door” is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, though titles like “Sit on a Happy Face” and “It’s a Small Dick After All” have proved maddeningly hard to forget. Nobody at or around our table has ever heard of Doctor Dirty before, but almost everyone agrees that he’s the ’98 gala’s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz’s 1997 seminude rendition of “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There’s also the ’98 ceremony’s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as “the Spicy Girls” and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.

Something else happens every year. It’s never part of AVN’s videotape of the gala, but it’s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom’s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum’s waiters. A lot of this year’s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, who pulls down the starboard side of her strapless taffeta and allows the waiter to cup her right breast while Table 189’s own personal waiter55 snaps the photo. Another waiter goes around behind Ms. Ann Amoré—a very personable black lady with a 50-inch bust and gang tattoos all down both arms—and hunches over behind her as she bends forward and releases her breasts from confinement, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he’s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend’s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they’re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank, distant way that they were with the mooks at the Adult CES.

Trying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo’d glasses they’ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel’s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, and the crowd parts slightly to allow a narrow passage for the Awards’ attendees, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It’s late, and everyone’s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand’s spectators earlier. Now it’s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars, and there’s a weird mix of adulation and derision:

“Love you, Brittany!”

“How’d you get that dress on, baby?”

“Look over here!”

“Does your mother know where you’re at right now?”

One florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don’t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.

Mr. Dick Filth is behind us with one hand on each of yr. corresps.’ shoulders (we’re basically supporting him out). Everyone’s ears are still ringing, and Filth knows enough to almost shout:

“You know,” he says, “we’ve also got the XRCO Awards in February. X-Rated Critics Organization Awards—you get me? They’re not in Vegas, and they’re not rigged. And yet they manage to be just as ridiculous.”",David Foster Wallace,1981,"[99, 82, 54, 53, 42, 42, 46, 52, 64, 79]",10

All night we play the horizontal bop right between her sheets

423,"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da","[Verse 1]
Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
The only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

[Chorus]
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

[Verse 2]
Poets, priests, and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no one's jamming their transmission
Because when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Proof died, what happened? (What happened?)
Marshall stopped rapping (Damn!)
I guess that makes me the captain (Uh-huh)
Hit the mattress (Okay)
Pistol-packing (Uh-huh), sick assassin (Yeah)
Hit the gas and (Okay), get to mashing
D12 broke up? Who you bitches asking?
Our clique's relaxing in the hills of Aspen
Popping pills and Aspirin
And I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life
Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight
So I figured that I would grab the mic
Like a nigga 'bout to rhyme right after Christ
Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight
Grab an O and I have to light
That's only right, living like a rock star is the only life!
And we are six grown men who are old friends
To my nigga Bugz, DeShaun Holton
All the way down, I'ma hold them
D12 nigga, 'til the world end (D12!)

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!

Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 2: Swifty]
A lot of niggas try to underestimate me
'Til I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea
Y'all been placed on a contract for hating
I'ma waste them, one by one, for tainting
My ability to kill a facility, I'ma send them to Satan
Fast as a child rapist facing
Life or trifle, Henny has made me in waiting
They gon' lock me up under the basement
I'm a one-man army, marine, and navy
You done made me angry, I'm crazy, insane
And maybe I bite the face of your baby
For anyone who try to diss Proof or Hailie
I'ma break their Halo
Put them on the reaper's payroll
Erase them and hang their soul
It ain't no hoes here, McVay got a scroll
With names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!

Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I know you thought we were done, we rose up
Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up
They hit us with the best shot and we're still standing
So tell the world it can lick our scrotum
Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt?
Who wanna be the fall guy? Who want the pump?
Who wanna get slumped just for looking at me sideways
Every time I roll up I'ma keep it blunt
Where did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall?
Y'all did it big like Costco
And we back in this bitch like a tampon
Still, talk dirty, Em's clean like a bar of soap
And you will soon slip on some buffoon shit
My hand's on a sweeper, yours on a broomstick
So stop looking all stupid, I'm rude and abusive
And strapped, don't make me use it

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place! (A'ight, here's where I come in at)

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I came in this game with bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin
So you might wanna button it like Benjamin
I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men
Step right in this mark with my henchmen and
Walk, straight to the stage
I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
Fall back, little cocksucker
I ain't A&W, don't get your cold mugs in my way
Get 'em? Shattered, fucking A
Been this way since B.C., what can I say?
I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
Don't get turned to a vegetable, dick face!
You ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois
D12 spitting flames like flamethrowers
Spit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors
That cut with the same force as chainsaws
Hope you're coming with your A game
'Cause things have changed in this game
Isn't the same game, boys
The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!

425,Another One Bites The Dust,"[Intro]
Ooh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh

[Verse 3]
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

426,Fireflies,"[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus (Extended)]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

427,Time Is Time,"Time it goes on waits for nobody special
In the prime of my life I'll remember you
Living and breathing and some misbelieving
But I can't hold you woman, no piece of you
You were the magic , my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right

Time it goes on waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistaking
But I'll follow you woman , eternally
You were the magic , my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right , all right

Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

428,Don't You Know What Love Is,"In some respects
I suspect you've got a respectable side
When pushed and pulled and pressured
You seldom run and hide
But it's for someone elses benefit
Not for what you wanna do
Until I realize that you've realized
I'm gonna say these words to you

You don't know what love is
You do as you're told
Just as a child at ten might act
But you're far too old
You're not hopeless or helpless
And I hate to sound cold
But you don't know what love is...
You just do as you're told

I can see your man
Can't help but win
Any problems that may arise
But in his mind there can be no sin
If you never criticize
You just keep on repeating
All those empty ""I love you's""
Until you say you deserve better
I'm gonna lay right into you

You don't know what love is
You just do as you're told
Just as a child of ten might act
But you're far too old
Your not hopeless or helpless
And I hate to sound cold
But you don't know what love is
No you don't know what love is
No you don't know what love is

429,I Made It Through The Rain,"We dreamers have our ways
Of facing rainy days
And somehow we survive

We keep the feelings warm
Protect them from the storm
Until our time arrives

Then one day the sun appears
And we come shining through those lonely years

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through

When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid

Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade

Cause when I chased my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through...

It's about to be some grown folks talkin here, okay?

Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be (okay)
Like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry (tell 'em!)
Talkin 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name? (woo!)
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session (okay)
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession (hey!)
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya about a grand so start savin your change (DTP!)
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps (uh-huh)
Sign yourself TO yourself and start signin ya own checks (woo!)
Hit the booth and start recordin at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowin, could be speed or weed (what else?)
Get it mixed and mastered (hey) pressed up and plastered (okay)
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be (hey!)

Most of these label heads, they don't care nothin about ya (nah)
If you stop sellin records they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixin business with pleasure so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other DAY (for real!)
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass (true that)

I wish his ass well but I don't want NOTHIN to do with him (woo!)
Some don't own they publishin; me? I never fool with 'em (nah)
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em (believe it)
Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant (DTP!)
Unless I'm still in competition with my president (what up Jay?)
And believe that I'm supportin the Hova
Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over (okay!)
But the first rule to accumulation of wealth (what's that?)
Is don't trust nobody but your GOD damned self!

Não te serve neste bar

A luz do dia em mim
Não cega, não me faz ver mal

Mais uma dança só pra mim

Mais uma dança só pra mim

[Verso 2]
Chega de sorriso largo
Quer me dar o que não tem
Não desvia o olhar
Quer saber o que já sei
Sem sentir
Quer saber o que eu já sei

Dá as costas traça planos
Para à noite me encontrar
Ponho o salto e o batom
Sei o que me faz dançar
Que o sentido neste jogo
Era para te mostrar
Que a miúda do café
Não dá cartas sem ganhar

435,Love On The Airwaves,"Looking out my window
Then I saw you walking by
Is it wishful thinking
Or just a trick of the light

Cause I should know better
Oh what a way to spend my time
But I just can't help it

Bridge:
Here I go turning on the radio
I hope they'll play my song for you

Refrain
Can you hear it
Am I getting through
Coz I'm sending this out to reach you
Can you hear me
I'm calling out your name
On the airwaves

Took a walk 'round your place
With every step I think of you
I kept seeing your face

And I know one day
Hey you'll meet me out there
Take my hand and fly away",Regine Velasquez,1981,"[100, 87, 88]",3
436,More Than I Can Say,"[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
I'm trying to put it all in words, but it's
More than I can say
It would take a whole lifetime to tell you
More than I can say
Every time I wrote a line it’s still
More than I can say
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
More than I can say

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure
The sickness: dreaming of riches
Reality was the cure. My doctor
Physician was music, I'm sure
The prescription was super-model sandwiches
And suicide doors. I used to stand in my mirror
Fixing up my hat right
DMV don't make licenses for the fast life
Was taught never drop my head when I'm doing right
And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights
I just want the whole world to bop their heads
Someone to stop my bread
If my pops was here, he'd be like ""son, you the one
They gotta crown you, a gift from around you
Know they don't understand you, but what can they handle?
If they was wearing Gucci loafers, they'd be through, over
Just stay on point, do what you do
Soldier: remember I'm with you when the world get colder..

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]

[Verse 2 - Nas]
Keep having the same dream
About a mic, a gun, a cross, they all
In the middle of flames
An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain
Hear a voice that asks what do I claim?
I ask what it means. It's sort of a trance
As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands
I could do what I wish with it, and waking up
To study my dreambook, see if it links up
Looking for some significance, like does the dream
Represent this cold world I'm living in?
Ask my man, then his laughter begin
He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun
Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic
The cross, I had it all my life, the same height
I'm trying to sneak sleep, so that my mind won't find out
Time out: my body won't wind down",Nas,1981,"[91, 91, 62, 49, 42, 29, 17, 10, 2]",9
437,Shine On,"[Hook: Joanna Newsom]
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on, it was right on

[Verse]
Uh, now, they lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
Got it, capisce? Hungry as hell trying to eat now
Success is the only thing that can complete us
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this (Logic)
Now I've accepted I'm not from the hood
Cause sellin' crack and bustin' gats don't make my raps good
See this is me, L.O.G.I.C. reppin' MD to the fullest
Push us to the limit but never pull us, now
I can't wait 'til I see my name in neon
That fly shit I be on flowin' for eons
Every day I take chances, Celine Dion
Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion, let's get it
I'm a diamond in the rough, but I shine like disco
Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though
Bumping up in they city like, ""oh my God, this go""
My business getting better every year like fiscal
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm a original see but they trace like stencil
A stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
'Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time
'Cause when I flow the crowd never roll 'cause I rock
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit

We should shine a light on, a light on

439,Who's Making Love,"All you fellows, gather round me
And let me give you some good advice
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
You better think about it twice
While you're out cheatin' on your woman
There is something you never even thought of
And that is:
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
I've seen so, so many fellows
All in that same old bag
Thinkin' that a woman is made to
To be beat on and treated so bad
Oh, fellows, let me ask you somethin'
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of
And that is:
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
I know that other women
Give the other excuse
I'm not tryin' to run your life
Boy, that's up to you, oh you
Oh oh, you you
Reason why I ask this question
I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late
Oh yeah, that's when it all happened
Something I never ever dreamed of
Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady
While I was out makin' love
Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady
While I was out makin' love
Now, who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady

440,Suddenly,"[Verse 1]
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it

[Bridge]
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

[Verse 2]
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly

[Outro]
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise

441,Fool That I Am,"Fool that I am
For falling in love with you
And a, fool that I am
For thinking you loved me, too

You took my heart
Then played the part of little coquette
And, all my dreams just disappeared
Like the smoke from a cigarette

Fool that I am
For hoping you'd understand
And thinking you
Would listen, too
And, oh, the things I had planned

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So, darling, darling, darling
This is goodbye
But I still care, but I still care

Don't run out that door
I want you just as much as before
I got no place
I'm in a hurry too

My feelings are deep and true
From the way it's going

Tried to take control of the love
Love took control of me

Love took control of me

444,I Don't Want To Know Your Name,"I see you just like the movies
I see your face
Across a crowded room
And I have learned through
Simple trial and error
Not to speak too soon

Your eyes just like a magnet
They're drawing my eyes around
And I can't hear one
Word of conversation
I can't hear a sound

I see you looking at me
You see me looking at you

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna know your name
And I don't wanna play this game
Where two lovers meet
And one lover parts in pain

I feel this urge to meet you
I feel this urge to run
Repairing hearts so easily shattered
Is never any fun

I see you looking at me
You see me looking at you

I seen a girl on a one-way corridor
Stealing down a wrong-way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on, on her feet
Well, the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the rollergirl, she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah, here she comes

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd

But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long

She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says, ""Toro, toro, taxi, see you tomorrow, my son""
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her, no, no, no
She got her own world in the city
Because the city's been so rude to her

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd

Or a glance given pause at the cost of our desired wrongs
It's second nature to love you, it's first to die
And we were killed upon waking, killed upon waking to the life
We weren't prepared to live but rebelled to realize
We were killed upon the pavement, Bonnie we're immortalized in

[Chorus]
Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying ""You were all I ever needed""
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank
Down in hotel rooms, to feel warm in cold love

[Verse 2]
What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same, you and I, we're the same
Not the same, we hurt differently, but consistent in our pain
Equal and equidistant in the way we laugh
To lay bare the weight of our cold love affair
Recalling the days where we were, we weren't, we were
Wrong for the papers, wrong for the dinner tables
Of the inner rings of the rich and famous anythings
It's gone, not bad, just gone, my bad, just wrong, we had
And we had, and we were then in

[Chorus]
Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying ""You were all I ever needed""
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank
Down in hotel rooms, to feel warm

[Outro]
What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same, you and I, we're the same
What's harder, harder to fake?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay the same for you?
Chained to a lie, who's to blame? Let it die, we're the same
In blood, cold, cold love, we were still young

451,My Mother's Eyes,"[Verse 1]
I can't believe you love me
After all the things I've done
I think I've been the devil
Since the day that I turned one
Like when I stole your money
Just to buy a pack of gum
I know it wasn't funny
Can't believe I was so dumb

[Pre-Chorus]
I blame it on my age
But even now, I'm not so young
I'm still stuck in my ways
I can't believe what I've become
Somehow, you feel the same
I guess that's motherly love
Motherly love
Wish I could find the piece in me
To see the good things that you see
It's not that easy

[Chorus]
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes

[Verse 2]
I can't believe you love me
After all the things I did
Like when I said I hated you when we were in Madrid
Like when I didn't answer you cause I was on the road
But you cooked my favorite dinner for me right when I get home

[Pre-Chorus]
I blame it on my stress
Cause I've been feeling so high strung
I'm looking for excuses
And I know that isn't one
Somehow, you feel the same
I guess that's motherly love
Motherly love
Wish I could find the piece in me
To see the good things that you see
It's not that easy

[Chorus]
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me

[Outro]
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes
Through my mother's eyes
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me
If I saw me through your eyes

453,Woman In Love,"[Verse 1]
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
I kissed the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right, I defend
Over and over again
What do I do

[Verse 2]
With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away
You feel my love, I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

I am a woman in love and I do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right, I defend

455,"Wynken, Blynken And Nod","Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
Sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew
""Where are you going, and what do you wish?""
The old moon asked the three
""We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beautiful sea;
Nets of silver and gold have we!""
Said Wynken, Blynken, And Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in the wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew
The little stars were the herring fish
That lived in that beautiful sea--
""Now cast your nets wherever you wish
Never afeard are we"";
So cried the stars to the fishermen three:
Wynken, Blynken, And Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home;
'T was all so pretty a sail it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought 't was a dream they 'd dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three:
Wynken, Blynken, And Nod

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle-bed
So shut your eyes while mother sings
Of wonderful sights that be
And you shall see the beautiful things
As you rock in the misty sea
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:

Trapped in the system, traffickin' drugs

Don't shit on my past, you ain't come from manure

But bitch I ain't come for no ruin
Just know all of my niggas, we struggled for it
Had to hustle for it, cried puddles for it
My pops watched his sister get locked for it
I done seen my niggas get knocked for it like {gunshot}
Gimme that, I carry Del Amo like a piggyback
I carry my city like guilt that ain't got no forgiveness
No way out, shit we locked in the system
Catch a case and they not gon' forgive ya
White skin, you be out before Christmas
Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
Tears from me, had to pray those days
Had to slave those days
Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood giveaways those days
Thank God for every inch that he gave us
Thank God for everything cause he made us
Like when that car bent the block, blat blat
Hit the homie but we made it to ER and he saved us
Thinkin' that he could've died, nigga
We was prayin' to the sky and his momma cried rivers
Healed up, but tough luck, he tried to get revenge
Had to drop, bullets popped and they killed him

I was standing in the rain in the middle of the trenches
Running from polices, jumping over fences
Serving in the them hotboxes living life relentless
Taking penitentiary chances still dodging the penitentiary
The teachers taught my cousins go to school and you done listen
Make your outlook on life different, damn you look suspicious
My granddad died a boss, and that's been on my memory
If you listen closer to me, feel the pain in my delivery

Flyer then the plain, moving faster then the train
Get the fuck up out my lane, some things gotta change

When the po-po ran up on me in Mexico
I dropped the blow I swear I never ran that fast before
And when I play it back in my memory in the studio
I swear I grind and I grind going hard every time
Going hard on my grind
Selling damaged bricks, shit be at a bunch of licks
I write a hundred songs every time I think of this
Take a 2 liter fill it up with codeine

Teacher teacher I haven't heard shit
I've been sitting in your class and I haven't learned shit
Teacher teach I can't sit it in my seat
I'm a pretty smart kid why you giving me D's
Teacher teacher somebody got to say it
What they're teaching you to teach me is all outdated
It's all out crazy and truthfully I know you're not a fan of this
Fuck your lesson plan and your Algebra and Calculus now
Teacher teacher I ain't gon lie
I ain't really focused cuz my uncle just died
And my daddy keep drinking and my momma keep crying
And I swear it's getting worse but I know to keep quiet
Teacher teach you ain't giving a fuck
I understand though they don't really pay you enough
You show up you ain't appreciated enough
And half my homies skip class just to face them a blunt

Painting visions of the past like a passage
Both a little bruised up but you know we managed
And that bond will never vanish
Used to hang out every day shit
We were so close your parent's took me on vacations
School was cool but it was never my thing
I was focused on ball trying better my game
At thirteen man I really thought I would play in the league
Fucked my whole winter up when I got cut from the team man
And I don't know about a god but I asked advice
A few years down the road is when I grabbed the mic
He told me grind 5 years as a sacrifice
Now the worlds mine mother fucker I'ma shine

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

Forced their way inside, now
They want us to surrender, us to surrender
But I could go all night right here
Between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send the message
We're saying ""give it up, give it up""

Caught up in the rodeo
Oh no, please God tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns

Wait for the dust to settle down around us, around us
And stick to what we know
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again, to breathe again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The world is in your palm now
So take a breath and calm down
Cause you have been selected, you've been selected
A few will ever find out
And if you don't see why, well
At least you've got your nest egg, you've got your nest egg
So live it up, live it up!

468,Girls Can Get It,"Girls have it made
Girls have more fun
Girls have their way
To get lovers anytime they want
Anytime she needs some lovin'
Anytime she just gives a sign
It won't take her long to find a man to oblige

Guys got to plot
Guys got to plan
Guys got to lie, cheat, steal
Do anything he can
Anything to get her to love him
Anything to make her agree
That's the way it's been since Adam and Eve

Girls can get it anytime they want
Girls can get it where a man often won't
Everybody's always after some lovin' now and then
A woman gets it faster than any man can

Girls can get it anytime they like
Girls can get it a fact of life
If she calls you for some lovin' in the middle of the night
She can get a man runnin' at the speed of light

We all look for love
Somewhere, sometime
Girls find it first
They find it morning, noon and night
And it's a wonder of nature, eighth wonder of the world
That a man's got to chase her if he's gonna get the girl

Oh, when a woman wants love
A woman gets love
And it's for sure she's gonna find it
Before the sun comes up

Girls can get it, they pick and choose
Girls can get it, men are always in the mood
If she calls you for some lovin' in the middle of the night
She can get a man runnin' at the speed of light

Girls can get it anytime they like
Girls can get it a fact of life
Oh, you know she'll find it easy
You know that she can
It's like givin' a little water to a thirsty man

Girls can get it anytime they want
Girls can get it where a man often won't",Dr. Hook,1981,"[84, 66, 57, 54, 35]",5
469,Sequel,"[Intro: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two
Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Whole game tighter now
Moving a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggas to see
Time to start the arising now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, ""Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff""
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, ""Jigga, whattup?""

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & (Jay-Z)]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
But had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate
But it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached (""Whattup Bleek?"") and I paused

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & Jay-Z]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Yeah, you done came up (uhh), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (uhh), now it's yo' time to shine (yeah)
Time to change up, no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, ""And what?""
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer (woo!)
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek, (Jay-Z) & Both]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line

I done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (game up), now it's yo' time to shine

Can I heal it on my own?

So I try to remember
Your face uh
It's hard I know
But the lightness grows

Everywhere I go
There are people I don't know
If I stay ordinary
Maybe they won't notice me

But I know that deep inside
No matter how hard I hide
You will find me on my own
When I'm with you I am home

So I try to remember your face uh
This place uh
It's hard I know
But the lightness grows

Getting fat where I sit down do you suppose it's old age coming
I get this feeling I'm no good for nothing life has led me wrong
Once in a while it makes it all worthwhile if I can sing this song

Got to rock on I can't be this way
I'm hanging around but wait till music's in season
That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all I need for a reason

Can't think straight can't think at all staring out the window
Hear the band I hear them call everything will disappear and

I get the feeling I can conquer anything gets in my way
Don't need no doctor 'caus I know exactly what I need today I

Got to rock on I can't be this way
I'm hanging around but wait till music's in season
That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all I need for a reason

The sun beats down upon me and it looks as tough that spring
Has waited long enough to get here she knows that I must
Sing about her future oh sing about her past I love to play my music
And I try to make it last but sometimes summer comes too fast

I got to rock on I can't be this way (cont.)",Kansas,1981,"[92, 76, 80, 90]",4

Just as on the cool stone
Of the spring, the water
Opens a wide flash of foam,
So is the smile of your face,
Lovely one.

Lovely one,
With delicate hands and slender feet
Like a silver pony,
Walking, flower of the world,
Thus I see you,
Lovely one.

Lovely one,
With a nest of copper entangled
On your head, a nest
The color of dark honey
Where my heart burns and rests,
Lovely one.

Lovely one,
Your eyes are too big for your face,
Your eyes are too big for the earth.

There are countries, there are rivers,
In your eyes,
My country is your eyes,
I walk through them,
They light the world
Through which I walk,
Lovely one.

Lovely one,
Your breasts are like two loaves made
Of grainy earth and golden moon,
Lovely one.

Lovely one,
Your waist,
My arm shaped it like a river when
It flowed a thousand years through your sweet body,
Lovely one.

Lovely one,
There is nothing like your hips,
Perhaps earth has
In some hidden place
The curve and the fragrance of your body,
Perhaps in some place,
Lovely one.

Lovely one, my lovely one,
Your voice, your skin, your nails,
Lovely one, my lovely one,
Your being, your light, your shadow,
Lovely one,
All that is mine, lovely one,
All that is mine, my dear,
When you walk or rest,
When you sing or sleep,
When you suffer or dream,
Always,
When you are near or far,
Always,
You are mine, my lovely one,
Always.

Bella,
como en la piedra fresca
del manantial, el agua
abre un ancho relámpago de espuma,
así es la sonrisa en tu rostro,
bella.

en tu cabeza, un nido
color de miel sombría
donde mi corazón arde y reposa,

Bella,
no te caben los ojos en la cara,
no te caben los ojos en la tierra.
Hay países, hay ríos,
en tus ojos,

yo camino por ellos,
ellos dan luz al mundo
por donde yo camino,

Bella,
tus senos son como dos panes hechos
de tierra cereal y luna de oro,

Bella,
tu cintura
la hizo mi brazo como un río cuando
pasó mil años por tu dulce cuerpo,

Bella,
no hay nada como tus caderas,
tal vez la tierra tiene
en algún sitio oculto
la curva y el aroma de tu cuerpo,
tal vez en algún sitio,
bella.

Bella, mi bella,
tu voz, tu piel, tus uñas,
bella, mi bella,
tu ser, tu luz, tu sombra,

24, staring in your face like it’s the front of the door
I know right now is hard cause this all feels like a chore
I don’t want this as a job help me find something more
I cannot tell the ceiling from the floor
Is this really what you want?
Swear I never meant to haunt
All I ever do is taunt
Couldn’t handle how you flaunt
Now it’s quiet on the front
Has been for so many months
Now it’s wild to remember I was in love with you once

[Chorus]
It's all love now, upside down
It's all love now, upside down

[Verse 2]
Let me go, cut the leash before
I lose us in a bad undertow
Have to channel how you made me feel
To play every show
Make my snide suggestions about
The things I don’t know
I will not catch a feeling I’ll just float
All that time across the pond
All this resin in my lungs
No more room to shoulder on
Am I even having fun?
Colin’s sleeping with his gun
Scott is looking for the one
Mertz is going by Ryan now that we’ve all had our run

It's all love now, upside down
It's all love now, upside down

So what can you get a Wookiee for Christmas
When he already owns a comb?
It's really a problem

What can you get a Wookiee for Christmas
When he already owns a comb?
What can you get in a hurry for a furry kind of friend like that
To take home?
No, he'll never wear galoshes
Or a hat upon his furry dome
So what can you get a Wookiee for Christmas
When he already owns a comb?

Let's give him love and understanding
Good will to men
We wrap it all up in bright colored ribbon
And we give it to him all over again
And that's what you get a Wookiee for Christmas
When he already owns a comb

That's what you get in a hurry for a furry kind of friend like that
To take home
'Cause he doesn't need a tie clip
And he doesn't need shaving foam

492,Without Your Love,"[Introduction]

[Verse 1]
Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes

[Verse 2]
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day

[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime

[Bridge]
The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day

Without your love
And I'm just doing my time

498,Merry Christmas In The NFL,"To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51 years (that is, since present management took over), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $155,501, a rate of 19.2% compounded annually.*

During the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really counts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of our resources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the tax that would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part “marked to market.”

By the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift that diminished the relevance of balance-sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the accounting rules that apply to controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities. The carrying value of the “losers” we own is written down, but “winners” are never revalued upwards.

We’ve had experience with both outcomes: I’ve made some dumb purchases, and the amount I paid for the economic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire’s book value. We’ve also had some winners — a few of them very big — but have not written those up by a penny.

Over time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gap between intrinsic value and book value. Today, the large — and growing — unrecorded gains at our “winners” make it clear that Berkshire’s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. That’s why we would be delighted to repurchase our shares should they sell as low as 120% of book value. At that level, purchases would instantly and meaningfully increase per-share intrinsic value for Berkshire’s continuing shareholders.

The unrecorded increase in the value of our owned businesses explains why Berkshire’s aggregate market- value gain — tabulated on the facing page — materially exceeds our book-value gain. The two indicators vary erratically over short periods. Last year, for example, book-value performance was superior. Over time, however, market-value gains should continue their historical tendency to exceed gains in book value.

    * All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500th of those shown for A.
The Year at BerkshireCharlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalized earning power to increase every year. (Actual year-to-year earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of weakness in the U.S. economy or, possibly, because of insurance mega-catastrophes.) In some years the normalized gains will be small; at other times they will be material. Last year was a good one. Here are the highlights:
             The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to better earnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service to customers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capital expenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annual depreciation charge. It was money well spent.

BNSF moves about 17% of America’s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whether transported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among the seven large American railroads (two of which are Canadian-based), carrying 45% more ton-miles of freight than our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to our shippers’ welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy.

For most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earnings weakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion* (a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks and deserve yours.

* Throughout this letter, all earnings are stated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.                       BNSF is the largest of our “Powerhouse Five,” a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Marmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies — our five most profitable non-insurance businesses — earned $13.1 billion in 2015, an increase of $650 million over 2014.

Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003. Subsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased the number outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire by the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.                       Next year, I will be discussing the “Powerhouse Six.” The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), a business that we purchased a month ago for more than $32 billion of cash. PCC fits perfectly into the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earning power.

Under CEO Mark Donegan, PCC has become the world’s premier supplier of aerospace components (most of them destined to be original equipment, though spares are important to the company as well). Mark’s accomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by Jacob Harpaz at IMC, our remarkable Israeli manufacturer of cutting tools. The two men transform very ordinary raw materials into extraordinary products that are used by major manufacturers worldwide. Each is the da Vinci of his craft.

PCC’s products, often delivered under multi-year contracts, are key components in most large aircraft. Other industries are served as well by the company’s 30,466 employees, who work out of 162 plants in 13 countries. In building his business, Mark has made many acquisitions and will make more. We look forward to having him deploy Berkshire’s capital.

A personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance of our own Todd Combs, who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educate me about both the business and Mark. Though Todd and Ted Weschler are primarily investment managers — they each handle about $9 billion for us — both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to Berkshire in other ways as well. Hiring these two was one of my best moves.                       With the PCC acquisition, Berkshire will own 10 1⁄4 companies that would populate the Fortune 500 if they were stand-alone businesses. (Our 27% holding of Kraft Heinz is the 1⁄4.) That leaves just under 98% of America’s business giants that have yet to call us. Operators are standing by.                       Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.7 billion last year, up from $5.1 billion in 2014. Within this group, we have one company that last year earned more than $700 million, two that earned between $400 million and $700 million, seven that earned between $250 million and $400 million, six that earned between $100 million and $250 million, and eleven that earned between $50 million and $100 million. We love them all: This collection of businesses will expand both in number and earnings as the years go by.                       When you hear talk about America’s crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they’re not talking about Berkshire. We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed in the United States.

I told you earlier about BNSF’s record capital expenditures in 2015. At the end of every year, our railroad’s physical facilities will be improved from those existing twelve months earlier.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) is a similar story. That company has invested $16 billion in renewables and now owns 7% of the country’s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation. Indeed, the 4,423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is six times the generation of the runner-up utility.

We’re not done. Last year, BHE made major commitments to the future development of renewables in support of the Paris Climate Change Conference. Our fulfilling those promises will make great sense, both for the environment and for Berkshire’s economics.                       Berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2015 — that makes 13 years in a row — and increased its float. During those years, our float — money that doesn’t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit — grew from $41 billion to $88 billion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire’s earnings, float generates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.

Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $26 billion during the 13-year period, including $1.8 billion earned in 2015. Without a doubt, Berkshire’s largest unrecorded wealth lies in its insurance business. We’ve spent 48 years building this multi-faceted operation, and it can’t be replicated.                       While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on acquisitions. Last year we contracted for 29 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $634 million in aggregate. The cost of these purchases ranged from $300,000 to $143 million.

Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons, if they are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us most definitely aren’t.) These purchases deploy capital in operations that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. That means no additional work for us, yet more earnings for Berkshire, a combination we find highly appealing. We will make many dozens of bolt-on deals in future years.                       Our Heinz partnership with Jorge Paulo Lemann, Alex Behring and Bernardo Hees more than doubled its size last year by merging with Kraft. Before this transaction, we owned about 53% of Heinz at a cost of
$4.25 billion. Now we own 325.4 million shares of Kraft Heinz (about 27%) that cost us $9.8 billion. The new company has annual sales of $27 billion and can supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with your Oscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favorite meal. (We will have the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile at the annual meeting — bring your kids.)

Though we sold no Kraft Heinz shares, “GAAP” (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) required us to record a $6.8 billion write-up of our investment upon completion of the merger. That leaves us with our Kraft Heinz holding carried on our balance sheet at a value many billions above our cost and many billions below its market value, an outcome only an accountant could love.

Berkshire also owns Kraft Heinz preferred shares that pay us $720 million annually and are carried at $7.7 billion on our balance sheet. That holding will almost certainly be redeemed for $8.32 billion in June (the earliest date allowed under the preferred’s terms). That will be good news for Kraft Heinz and bad news for Berkshire.

Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners. We share with them a passion to buy, build and hold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires. We follow different paths, however, in pursuing this goal.

Their method, at which they have been extraordinarily successful, is to buy companies that offer an opportunity for eliminating many unnecessary costs and then — very promptly — to make the moves that will get the job done. Their actions significantly boost productivity, the all-important factor in America’s economic growth over the past 240 years. Without more output of desired goods and services per working hour — that’s the measure of productivity gains — an economy inevitably stagnates. At much of corporate America, truly major gains in productivity are possible, a fact offering opportunities to Jorge Paulo and his associates.

At Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we follow an approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run by cost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, our role is simply to create an environment in which these CEOs — and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded — can maximize both their managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs. (With this hands-off style, I am heeding a well-known Mungerism: “If you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure to marry someone with the intent of changing their behavior.”)

We will continue to operate with extreme — indeed, almost unheard of — decentralization at Berkshire. But we will also look for opportunities to partner with Jorge Paulo, either as a financing partner, as was the case when his group purchased Tim Horton’s, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, as at Heinz. We also may occasionally partner with others, as we have successfully done at Berkadia.

Berkshire, however, will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions. To be sure, certain hostile offers are justified: Some CEOs forget that it is shareholders for whom they should be working, while other managers are woefully inept. In either case, directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant to make the change required. That’s when new faces are needed. We, though, will leave these “opportunities” for others. At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.                       Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments — American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing our ownership to 8.4% versus 7.8% at yearend 2014) and Wells Fargo (going to 9.8% from 9.4%). At the other two companies, Coca-Cola and American Express, stock repurchases raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.2% to 9.3%, and our interest in American Express increased from 14.8% to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren’t important, consider this math: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire’s portion of their annual earnings by about $500 million.

These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. Their returns on tangible equity range from excellent to staggering. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.

If Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2015 earnings amounted to $4.7 billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends they pay us — about $1.8 billion last year. But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies’ earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.

The earnings our investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock — a move that increases Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. The retained earnings of these companies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time. If gains do indeed materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and so, too, will our unrealized capital gains.

Our flexibility in capital allocation — our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled businesses — gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they will operate. Woody Allen once explained that the advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chance of finding a date on Saturday night. In like manner — well, not exactly like manner — our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire’s endless gusher of cash. Beyond that, having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpile of funds that can be tapped when an elephant-sized acquisition is offered to us.       * * * * * * * * * * * *

It’s an election year, and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems (which, of course, only they can solve). As a result of this negative drumbeat, many Americans now believe that their children will not live as well as they themselves do.

That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.

American GDP per capita is now about $56,000. As I mentioned last year that — in real terms — is a staggering six times the amount in 1930, the year I was born, a leap far beyond the wildest dreams of my parents or their contemporaries. U.S. citizens are not intrinsically more intelligent today, nor do they work harder than did Americans in 1930. Rather, they work far more efficiently and thereby produce far more. This all-powerful trend is certain to continue: America’s economic magic remains alive and well.

Some commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP — and, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate. But let’s do some simple math using the much-lamented 2% figure. That rate, we will see, delivers astounding gains.
America’s population is growing about .8% per year (.5% from births minus deaths and .3% from net migration). Thus 2% of overall growth produces about 1.2% of per capita growth. That may not sound impressive. But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in real GDP per capita. (Compounding’s effects produce the excess over the percentage that would result by simply multiplying 25 x 1.2%.) In turn, that 34.4% gain will produce a staggering $19,000 increase in real GDP per capita for the next generation. Were that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four. Today’s politicians need not shed tears for tomorrow’s children.

Indeed, most of today’s children are doing well. All families in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth. His unparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is — to name just a few — transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he could not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.

Though the pie to be shared by the next generation will be far larger than today’s, how it will be divided will remain fiercely contentious. Just as is now the case, there will be struggles for the increased output of goods and services between those people in their productive years and retirees, between the healthy and the infirm, between the inheritors and the Horatio Algers, between investors and workers and, in particular, between those with talents that are valued highly by the marketplace and the equally decent hard-working Americans who lack the skills the market prizes. Clashes of that sort have forever been with us — and will forever continue. Congress will be the battlefield; money and votes will be the weapons. Lobbying will remain a growth industry.

The good news, however, is that even members of the “losing” sides will almost certainly enjoy — as they should — far more goods and services in the future than they have in the past. The quality of their increased bounty will also dramatically improve. Nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want — nor, even more so, in delivering what people don’t yet know they want. My parents, when young, could not envision a television set, nor did I, in my 50s, think I needed a personal computer. Both products, once people saw what they could do, quickly revolutionized their lives. I now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online. And, as I write this letter, “search” is invaluable to me. (I’m not ready for Tinder, however.)

For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. America’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America’s social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America’s kids will live far better than their parents did.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Considering this favorable tailwind, Berkshire (and, to be sure, a great many other businesses) will almost certainly prosper. The managers who succeed Charlie and me will build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by following our simple blueprint of: (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. Management will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.
Intrinsic Business ValueAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). It is possible, however, to make a sensible estimate. In our 2010 annual report we laid out the three elements — one of them qualitative — that we believe are the keys to an estimation of Berkshire’s intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 113-114.

Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased 8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses — including insurance underwriting income — increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factor the dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-counting of value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortization and minority interests. Income taxes, though, are not deducted. That is, the earnings are pre-tax.

I used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwriting income in business earnings. We did not do that when we initially introduced Berkshire’s two quantitative pillars of valuation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn’t blow and the earth didn’t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe would produce red ink. In order to be conservative then in stating our business earnings, we consistently assumed that underwriting would break even over time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value.

Today, our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because we have deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year, our underwriting income contributed $1,118 per share to the $12,304 per share of earnings referenced in the second paragraph of this section. Over the past decade, annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share, and we anticipate being profitable in most years. You should recognize, however, that underwriting in any given year could well be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so.

Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our earnings (including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operating earnings.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them (though there are important and enduring economic advantages to having them all under one roof). Our intent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being the reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (Don’t get excited; this is not a switch we are considering.)
InsuranceLet’s look first at insurance. The property-casualty (“P/C”) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world, as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is far in excess of the value at which it is carried on our books.

One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums — money we call “float” — that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:

TABLE

Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specialized operations are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will be very gradual — at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire’s economic fortress. It will never be compromised.

If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money — and, better yet, get paid for holding it.

Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest rates the world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many years to come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It’s a good bet that industry results over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize in reinsurance.

As noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $26.2 billion. That’s no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.

So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of float as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims and related expenses — a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 — and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float.
If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises — because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute — is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out the door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.

A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying our insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.

Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of  our insurance goodwill — what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it — to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion we carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripled our float. Its value today is one reason — a huge reason — why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.

First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.

Indeed, Berkshire is far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe — a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced — Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.

When Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in the insurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to our reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.

At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate premium can’t be obtained.
Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,” spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.

Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge float has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.

It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused commentators — and me as well, briefly — to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Re is now a gem.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 65 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 54 years of service in 2015. Tony became CEO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is no better manager than Tony. In the 40 years that I’ve known him, his every action has made great sense.

When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO would succeed because it deserved to succeed.

No one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them — and only a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with GEICO. So stop reading — right now! — and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.

GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after year. (We ended 2015 with 11.4% of the market compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) The company’s low costs create a moat — an enduring one — that competitors are unable to cross.

All the while, our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. I love hearing the little guy deliver his message: “15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.” (Of course, there’s always a grouch in the crowd. One of my friends says he is glad that only a few animals can talk, since the ones that do speak seem unable to discuss any subject but insurance.)

* * * * * * * * * * * *

In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies that primarily write commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation that consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually much better than that reported by their competitors. Indeed, over the past 13 years, this group has earned $4 billion from underwriting — about 13% of its premium volume — while increasing its float from $943 million to $9.9 billion.

Less than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”), which we include in this group. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge. That move was a home run: BHSI has already developed $1 billion of annual premium volume and, under Peter’s direction, is destined to become one of the world’s leading P/C insurers.
Here’s a recap of underwriting earnings and float by division:

TABLE

Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by wide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.
Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. Together, they last year accounted for 37% of Berkshire’s after-tax operating earnings.

A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would far exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF’s interest coverage was more than 8:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest, not EBITDA/ interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)

At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an essential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This economic fact benefits both us and our customers.

All told, BHE and BNSF invested $11.6 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment to key components of America’s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise reasonable returns — and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.

Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need huge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providers in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.

Low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE’s average retail rate is 6.8¢ per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.5¢. Here are the comparable industry figures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0¢, Missouri 9.3¢, Illinois 9.3¢, Minnesota 9.7¢. The national average is 10.4¢. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.
At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried. To supply a very crude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was just under 3¢ last year, while shipping costs for customers of the other four major U.S.-based railroads were at least 40% higher, ranging from 4.2¢ to 5.3¢.

Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no state comes close to Iowa, where last year megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 47% of all megawatt-hours sold to our retail customers. (Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take that figure to 58% in 2017.)

BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost 500 miles. That makes the railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads alleviate highway congestion — and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic — in a major way.

Here are the key figures for BHE and BNSF:

TABLE

I currently expect increased after-tax earnings at BHE in 2016, but lower earnings at BNSF.
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing OperationsOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let’s look, though, at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group.

TABLE

* Earnings for 2013 have been restated to exclude Marmon’s leasing operations, which are now included in the Finance and Financial Products results.

Our income and expense data conforming to GAAP is on page 38. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP because they exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.

I won’t explain all of the adjustments — some are tiny and arcane — but serious investors should understand the disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no way lose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recording charges against other intangibles, such as customer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rules and clearly does not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated — even though, from an investor’s viewpoint, they could not differ more.
In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have been deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non- existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real amortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies.

The table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by GAAP. We now have $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years. Eventually, of course, every dollar of these “assets” will be charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even if true earnings are flat. (My gift to my successor.)

I suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs. But it is with some trepidation that I do that, knowing that it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real. “Stock-based compensation” is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: “compensation.” If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?

Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring “earnings” figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don’t know any better. Or maybe they fear losing “access” to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else is playing the game, why shouldn’t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty of propagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.

Depreciation charges are a more complicated subject but are almost always true costs. Certainly they are at Berkshire. I wish we could keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge, but in 51 years I’ve yet to figure out how to do so. Indeed, the depreciation charge we record in our railroad business falls far short of the capital outlays needed to merely keep the railroad running properly, a mismatch that leads to GAAP earnings that are higher than true economic earnings. (This overstatement of earnings exists at all railroads.) When CEOs or investment bankers tout pre-depreciation figures such as EBITDA as a valuation guide, watch their noses lengthen while they speak.

Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however, you should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report. You should also subtract something to reflect BNSF’s inadequate depreciation charge.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Let’s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.

A few, however — these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation — have very poor returns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. At other times, I stumbled in evaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. I will commit more errors; you can count on that. If we luck out, they will occur at our smaller operations.

Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average of $25.6 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and using only token amounts of leverage, earned 18.4% after-tax on that capital.
Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price. We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large figure we show for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Earnings from the group should grow substantially in 2016 as Duracell and Precision Castparts enter the fold.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their competitors — both current and potential — read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if others knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of our operations on pages 88-91.
Finance and Financial ProductsOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and Marmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). These companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. At each of the three, we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors, and that’s paid off. Dealing from strength is one of Berkshire’s enduring advantages.

Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the second-largest home builder in America. Last year, the company sold 34,397 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought by Americans. In contrast, the company was number three in the field, with a 14% share, when Berkshire purchased it in 2003.

Manufactured homes allow the American dream of home ownership to be achieved by lower-income citizens: Around 70% of new homes costing $150,000 or less come from our industry. About 46% of Clayton’s homes are sold through the 331 stores we ourselves own and operate. Most of Clayton’s remaining sales are made to 1,395 independent retailers.

Key to Clayton’s operation is its $12.8 billion mortgage portfolio. We originate about 35% of all mortgages on manufactured homes. About 37% of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation, with the balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market only the homes of our competitors.

Lenders other than Clayton have come and gone. With Berkshire’s backing, however, Clayton steadfastly financed home buyers throughout the panic days of 2008-2009. Indeed, during that period, Clayton used precious capital to finance dealers who did not sell our homes. The funds we supplied to Goldman Sachs and General Electric at that time produced headlines; the funds Berkshire quietly delivered to Clayton both made home ownership possible for thousands of families and kept many non-Clayton dealers alive.

Our retail outlets, employing simple language and large type, consistently inform home buyers of alternative sources for financing — most of it coming from local banks — and always secure acknowledgments from customers that this information has been received and read. (The form we use is reproduced in its actual size on page 119.)
Mortgage-origination practices are of great importance to both the borrower and to society. There is no question that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008, which in turn led to the Great Recession. In the years preceding the meltdown, a destructive and often corrupt pattern  of  mortgage  creation  flourished  whereby  (1)  an  originator  in,  say,  California  would  make  loans  and (2) promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in, say, New York, which would package many mortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgage-backed securities to be (3) sold to unwitting institutions around the world.

As if these sins weren’t sufficient to create an unholy mess, imaginative investment bankers sometimes concocted a second layer of sliced-up financing whose value depended on the junkier portions of primary offerings. (When Wall Street gets “innovative,” watch out!) While that was going on, I described this “doubling-up” practice as requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single security being offered.

Both the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven by volume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applications while mortgage originators looked the other way. Naturally, the gamiest credits generated the most profits. Smooth Wall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable to understand. (It’s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the more complex structures. But rate them they did.)

Barney Frank, perhaps the most financially-savvy member of Congress during the panic, recently assessed the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, saying, “The one major weakness that I’ve seen in the implementation was this decision by the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages.” Today, some legislators and commentators continue to advocate a 1%-to-5% retention by the originator as a way to align its interests with that of the ultimate lender or mortgage guarantor.

At Clayton, our risk retention was, and is, 100%. When we originate a mortgage we keep it (leaving aside the few that qualify for a government guarantee). When we make mistakes in granting credit, we therefore pay a price — a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home. Last year we had to foreclose on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages at a cost to us of $157 million.

The average loan we made in 2015 was only $59,942, small potatoes for traditional mortgage lenders, but a daunting commitment for our many lower-income borrowers. Our buyer acquires a decent home — take a look at the home we will have on display at our annual meeting — requiring monthly principal-and-interest payments that average $522.

Some borrowers, of course, will lose their jobs, and there will be divorces and deaths. Others will get over- extended on credit cards and mishandle their finances. We will lose money then, and our borrower will lose his down payment (though his mortgage payments during his time of occupancy may have been well under rental rates for comparable quarters). Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their payment behavior during the Great Recession was far better than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by people earning multiples of our typical borrower’s income.

The strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we’ve done well with our mortgage portfolio. Equally important, we have financed much of the portfolio with floating-rate debt or with short- term fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us a constantly-widening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio, which bears fixed rates. (Incidentally, we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought long-term bonds and financed the position in some short-term manner.)
Normally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing at Clayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however, we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn short-term rates. More often, our short-term investments are in the $40 billion to $60 billion range. If we have, say, $60 billion invested at ¼% or less, a sharp move to higher short-term rates would bring benefits to us far exceeding the higher financing costs we would incur in funding Clayton’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. In banking terms, Berkshire is — and always will be — heavily asset-sensitive and will consequently benefit from rising interest rates.

Let me talk about one subject of which I am particularly proud, that having to do with regulation. The Great Recession caused mortgage originators, servicers and packagers to come under intense scrutiny and to be assessed many billions of dollars in fines and penalties.

The scrutiny has certainly extended to Clayton, whose mortgage practices have been continuously reviewed and examined in respect to such items as originations, servicing, collections, advertising, compliance, and internal controls. At the federal level, we answer to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dozens of states regulate us as well. During the past two years, indeed, various federal and state authorities (from 25 states) examined and reviewed Clayton and its mortgages on 65 occasions. The result? Our total fines during this period were $38,200 and our refunds to customers $704,678. Furthermore, though we had to foreclose on 2.64% of our manufactured-home mortgages last year, 95.4% of our borrowers were current on their payments at yearend, as they moved toward owning a debt-free home.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Marmon’s rail fleet expanded to 133,220 units by yearend, a number significantly increased by the company’s purchase of 25,085 cars from General Electric on September 30. If our fleet was connected to form a single train, the engine would be in Omaha and the caboose in Portland, Maine.

At yearend, 97% of our railcars were leased, with about 15-17% of the fleet coming up for renewal each year. Though “tank cars” sound like vessels carrying crude oil, only about 7% of our fleet carries that product; chemicals and refined petroleum products are the lead items we transport. When trains roll by, look for the UTLX or Procor markings that identify our tank cars. When you spot the brand, puff out your chest; you own a portion of that car.

Here’s the earnings recap for this sector:

Held under contract of sale for this amount. Berkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At yearend these shares were worth $11.8 billion. We are likely to purchase them just before expiration of our option and, if we wish, we can use our $5 billion of Bank of America 6% preferred to fund the purchase. In the meantime, it is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth largest equity investment — and one we value highly.
Productivity and ProsperityEarlier, I told you how our partners at Kraft Heinz root out inefficiencies, thereby increasing output per hour of employment. That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America’s remarkable gains in living standards since the nation’s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of “secret” is appropriate: Too few Americans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity. To see that connection, let’s look first at the country’s most dramatic example — farming — and later examine three Berkshire-specific areas.

In 1900, America’s civilian work force numbered 28 million. Of these, 11 million, a staggering 40% of the total, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to its production and the yield per acre was 30 bushels, for a total output of 2.7 billion bushels annually.

Then came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivity as planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn. Productivity, however, has improved yields to more than 150 bushels per acre, for an annual output of 13-14 billion bushels. Farmers have made similar gains with other products.

Increased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have been accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (“human input”). Today about three million people work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods have allowed tens of millions of present-day workers to utilize their time and talents in other endeavors, a reallocation of human resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farm goods and services they would otherwise lack.

It’s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agricultural innovations have been — not just for farmers but, more broadly, for our entire society. We would not have anything close to the America we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity. (It was fortunate that horses couldn’t vote.) On a day-to-day basis, however, talk of the “greater good” must have rung hollow to farm hands who lost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could. We will examine this flip-side to productivity gains later in this section.

For the moment, however, let’s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences for Berkshire subsidiaries. Similar transformations have been commonplace throughout American business.
       In  1947,  shortly  after  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  American  workforce  totaled  44  million.  About

1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved by Class I railroads that year totaled 655 billion.

By 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only 187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-related employees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggering improvement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by 55% since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annually in current dollars.

Another startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would need well over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employment would raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today’s volume would actually move.)
Our own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe. In 1996, the merged company’s first full year of operation, 411 million ton-miles of freight were transported by 45,000 employees. Last year the comparable figures were 702 million ton-miles (plus 71%) and 47,000 employees (plus only 4%). That dramatic gain in productivity benefits both owners and shippers. Safety at BNSF has improved as well: Reportable injuries were 2.04 per 200,000 man-hours in 1996 and have since fallen more than 50% to 0.95.             A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures cars and their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies — the kind dealing in fire insurance. This agency-centric approach included high commissions and other underwriting expenses that consumed about 40¢ of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver’s seat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another when commissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine — except for the consumer.

And then some American ingenuity came into play: G. J. Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, came up with the idea of a captive sales force that would sell the insurance products of only a single company. His baby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses — moves that permitted lower prices — and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been the runaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner’s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with a direct distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwriting expenses of about 25%.

In the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (“USAA”), a mutual-like company, was writing auto insurance for military officers on a direct-to-the-customer basis. This marketing innovation rose from a need that military personnel had to buy insurance that would stay with them as they moved from base to base. That was business of little interest to local insurance agencies, which wanted the steady renewals that came from permanent residents.

The direct distribution method of USAA, as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by State Farm and Allstate and therefore delivered an even greater bargain to customers. That made Leo and Lillian Goodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution model beyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated Government Employees Insurance Co. (later compressing this mouthful to GEICO).

Their fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did
$22.6 billion, more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the second mouse gets the cheese.) GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAA being the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA but spends considerably more on advertising aimed at promoting growth.)

With the price advantage GEICO’s low costs allow, it’s not surprising that several years ago the company seized the number two spot in auto insurance from Allstate. GEICO is also gaining ground on State Farm, though it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 — my 100th birthday — I plan to announce that GEICO has taken over the top spot. Mark your calendar.

GEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at the workforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe, however, that the number would be at least 60,000, a combination of what the insurer would need in direct employment and the personnel required at supporting agencies.           In its electric utility business, our Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) operates within a changing economic model. Historically, the survival of a local electric company did not depend on its efficiency. In fact, a “sloppy” operation could do just fine financially.

That’s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at a level that gave them a prescribed return upon the capital they employed. The joke in the industry was that a utility was the only business that would automatically earn more money by redecorating the boss’s office. And some CEOs ran things accordingly.

That’s all changing. Today, society has decided that federally-subsidized wind and solar generation is in our country’s long-term interest. Federal tax credits are used to implement this policy, support that makes renewables price-competitive in certain geographies. Those tax credits, or other government-mandated help for renewables, may eventually erode the economics of the incumbent utility, particularly if it is a high-cost operator. BHE’s long-established emphasis on efficiency — even when the company didn’t need it to attain authorized earnings — leaves us particularly competitive in today’s market (and, more important, in tomorrow’s as well).

BHE acquired its Iowa utility in 1999. In the year before, that utility employed 3,700 people and produced 19 million megawatt-hours of electricity. Now we employ 3,500 people and produce 29 million megawatt- hours. That major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years, a period during which industry rates increased 44%.

The safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015 compared to the rate of 7.0 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation.

In 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before our purchase PacifiCorp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year the numbers were 5,700 employees and 56.3 million megawatt-hours. Here, too, safety improved dramatically, with the accident-rate-per-100-employees falling from 3.4 in 2005 to .85 in 2015. In safety, BHE now ranks in the industry’s top decile.

Those outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a utility in their jurisdiction. The regulators know the company will run an efficient, safe and reliable operation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense. (BHE has never paid a dividend to Berkshire since we assumed ownership. No investor-owned utility in America comes close to matching BHE’s enthusiasm for reinvestment.)     * * * * * * * * * * * *

The productivity gains that I’ve just spelled out — and countless others that have been achieved in America have delivered awesome benefits to society. That’s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed — and will continue to enjoy — major gains in the goods and services they receive.

To this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largely benefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay a terrible price when innovation or new efficiencies upend their worlds.

We need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of public shareholders). It’s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from good decisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrong choices. Moreover, investors who diversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winning investments have always far more than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20th Century, the Dow Jones Industrial Average — an index fund of sorts — soared from 66 to 11,497, with its component companies all the while paying ever-increasing dividends.)
A long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact to produce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decent employment elsewhere; for others, that is not an option.

When low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded, putting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they could learn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood they could not replace. The same scenario unfolded in slow-motion at our original New England textile operation, which struggled for 20 years before expiring. Many older workers at our New Bedford plant, as a poignant example, spoke Portuguese and knew little, if any, English. They had no Plan B.

The answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity. Americans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever be employed in farming.

The solution, rather, is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing to work but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformed and expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that would try to make sure America works for those willing to work.) The price of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for the unfortunate.
Important RisksWe, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog “risk factors” in our 10-K. I can’t remember, however, an instance when reading a 10-K’s “risk” section has helped me in evaluating a business. That’s not because the identified risks aren’t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known. Beyond that, a 10-K’s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening event actually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss. A threat that will only surface 50 years from now may be a problem for society, but it is not a financial problem for today’s investor.

Berkshire operates in more industries than any company I know of. Each of our pursuits has its own array of possible problems and opportunities. Those are easy to list but hard to evaluate: Charlie, I and our various CEOs often differ in a very major way in our calculation of the likelihood, the timing and the cost (or benefit) that may result from these possibilities.

Let me mention just a few examples. To begin with an obvious threat, BNSF, along with other railroads, is certain to lose significant coal volume over the next decade. At some point in the future — though not, in my view, for a long time — GEICO’s premium volume may shrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our auto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for when purchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storage capabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers and certain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us — but even the most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.

None of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire’s long-term well-being. When we took over the company in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: “The northern textile business in which all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.” That development, however, was no death knell. We simply adapted. And we will continue to do so.
Every day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changing world. Just as vigorously, Charlie and I focus on where a steady stream of funds should be deployed. In that respect, we possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believe that Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I’ve itemized above — and many more — and to emerge with ever-greater earning power.

There is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I are powerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a “successful” (as defined by the aggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States. That is a risk Berkshire shares with all of American business.

The probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It’s been more than 70 years since I delivered a Washington Post newspaper headlining the fact that the United States had dropped the first atomic bomb. Subsequently, we’ve had a few close calls but avoided catastrophic destruction. We can thank our government — and luck! — for this result.

Nevertheless, what’s a small probability in a short period approaches certainty in the longer run. (If there is only one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in a century is 96.6%.) The added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps even nations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country. Their means of doing so have increased exponentially during my lifetime. “Innovation” has its dark side.

There is no way for American corporations or their investors to shed this risk. If an event occurs in the U.S. that leads to mass devastation, the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated.

No one knows what “the day after” will look like. I think, however, that Einstein’s 1949 appraisal remains apt: “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”

I am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this year’s annual meeting. The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might present to our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.

It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say “highly likely” rather than “certain” because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most “experts” about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger.

This issue bears a similarity to Pascal’s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued that if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because the rewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance the planet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now is foolhardy. Call this Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear.

It’s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by climate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that property losses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- or twenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.
Think back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company’s average loss-per-policy was then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increase to about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn’t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.

Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans involved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So, paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had remained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather than one doing $23 billion.

Up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather- related events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years, which is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely — though far from certain — effect on Berkshire’s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable.

As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.
The Annual MeetingCharlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21st th. The Yahoo! webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews with managers, directors and shareholders. Then, at 9:30, Charlie and I will commence answering questions.

This new arrangement will serve two purposes. First, it may level off or modestly decrease attendance at the meeting. Last year’s record of more than 40,000 attendees strained our capacity. In addition to quickly filling the CenturyLink Center’s main arena, we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms at the adjoining Omaha Hilton. All major hotels were sold out notwithstanding Airbnb’s stepped-up presence. Airbnb was especially helpful for those visitors on limited budgets.

Our second reason for initiating a webcast is more important. Charlie is 92, and I am 85. If we were partners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look in occasionally to make sure we hadn’t drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come to Omaha to monitor how we look and sound. (In making your evaluation, be kind: Allow for the fact that we didn’t look that impressive when we were at our best.)

Viewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consume enough Coke, See’s fudge and See’s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman. Long ago we discovered a fundamental truth: There’s nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you’re really hungry — and want to stay that way.

Shareholders planning to attend the meeting should come at 7 a.m. when the doors open at CenturyLink Center and start shopping. Carrie Sova will again be in charge of the festivities. She had her second child late last month, but that did not slow her down. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in those who work with her. She is aided by hundreds of Berkshire employees from around the country and by our entire home office crew as well, all of them pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners.
Last year we increased the number of hours available for shopping at the CenturyLink. Sales skyrocketed — so, naturally, we will stay with the new schedule. On Friday, April 29th you can shop between noon and 5 p.m., and on Saturday exhibits and stores will be open from 7 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.

On Saturday morning, we will have our fifth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target will again be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager — in my one brief flirtation with honest labor — I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good at this game. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).

The competition begins at 7:15, when contestants will make preliminary tosses. The eight throws judged most accurate — four made by contestants 12 or under, and four made by the older set — will compete against me at 7:45. The young challengers will each receive a prize. But the older ones will have to beat me to take anything home.

And be sure to check out the Clayton home itself. It can be purchased for $78,900, fully installed on land you provide. In past years, we’ve made many sales on the meeting day. Kevin Clayton will be on hand with his order book.

At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer period, which (including a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour or so and can safely be skipped by those craving a little last-minute shopping.

Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will be captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our subsidiaries. Your children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.

We will have a new and very special exhibit in the hall this year: a full-size model of the world’s largest aircraft engine, for which Precision Castparts makes many key components. The real engines weigh about 20,000 pounds and are ten feet in diameter and 22 feet in length. The bisected model at the meeting will give you a good look at many PCC components that help power your flights.

Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to you with your meeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanut brittle take their toll.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.

A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from around the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend the savings on our other products.
Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new titles. Andy Kilpatrick will introduce (and be glad to sign) the latest edition of his all-encompassing coverage of Berkshire. It’s 1,304 pages and weighs 9.8 pounds. (My blurb for the book: “Ridiculously skimpy.”) Check out Peter Bevelin’s new book as well. Peter has long been a keen observer of Berkshire.

We will also have a new, 20-page-longer edition of Berkshire’s 50-year commemorative book that at last year’s meeting sold 12,000 copies. Since then, Carrie and I have uncovered additional material that we find fascinating, such as some very personal letters sent by Grover Cleveland to Edward Butler, his friend and the then- publisher of The Buffalo News. Nothing from the original edition has been changed or eliminated, and the price remains $20. Charlie and I will jointly sign 100 copies that will be randomly placed among the 5,000 available for sale at the meeting.

My friend, Phil Beuth, has written Limping on Water, an autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital Cities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. These two were the best managerial duo — both in what they accomplished and how they did it — that Charlie and I ever witnessed. Much of what you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy. Start with Tom Murphy, and you’ll never need a second exemplar.

Finally, Jeremy Miller has written Warren Buffett’s Ground Rules, a book that will debut at the annual meeting. Mr. Miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of Buffett Partnership Ltd. and of explaining how Berkshire’s culture has evolved from its BPL origin. If you are fascinated by investment theory and practice, you will enjoy this book.

An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs. Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2 1⁄2 hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to
$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week encompassing the meeting, the store did a record $44,239,493 of business. If you repeat that figure to a retailer, he is not going to believe you. (An average week for NFM’s Omaha store — the highest-volume home furnishings store in the United States except for our new Dallas store — is about $9 million.)

To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26th and Monday, May 2nd inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend” NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to which you are all invited.

At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, April 29th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1st, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. During last year’s Friday-Sunday stretch, the store wrote a sales ticket every 15 seconds that it was open.

We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25th through Saturday, May 7th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing you own our stock.

On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. I will join them and hope to have Ajit and Charlie there also.

My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met Ariel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a junior at Princeton, having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.

Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1st, serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before). As for my other favorite restaurant, Piccolo’s, I’m sad to report it closed.



From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is asked.)

An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will be Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.

Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough, for sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as many questioners as possible a shot at us.

All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 64 in total.) The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.
While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his savings.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of our managers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.

Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,400-page Federal income tax return — that’s up 6,000 pages from the prior year! — oversees the filing of 3,530 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities, fact-checks this letter — and the list goes on and on.

They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy and pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt with the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day. In fact, my job becomes more fun every year.

In 2015, Berkshire’s revenues increased by $16 billion. Look carefully, however, at the two pictures on the facing page. The top one is from last year’s report and shows the entire Berkshire home-office crew at our Christmas lunch. Below that photo is this year’s Christmas photo portraying the same 25 people identically positioned. In 2015, no one joined us, no one left. And the odds are good that you will see a photo of the same 25 next year.

Can you imagine another very large company — we employ 361,270 people worldwide — enjoying that kind of employment stability at headquarters? At Berkshire we have hired some wonderful people — and they have stayed with us. Moreover, no one is hired unless he or she is truly needed. That’s why you’ve never read about “restructuring” charges at Berkshire.

On April 30th, come to Omaha — the cradle of capitalism — and meet my gang. They are the best.

499,Gypsy Spirit,"She said, meet me at the crossroads at midnight
With a raven's caw, it's half past twelve and there’s no one here to see me
I know your eyes, my dreams have cried, the longing I have lived
From another life another time I hear you in the night

From our gypsy incarnation
It was a gypsy incarnation
Our gypsy incarnation we loved

Many lives and many loves have passed since last I saw your face
Still, I remember the love we shared that we’d meet in some new place
We made the vow at full moon's glow to find each other again
From another life another time I hear you in the night

From our gypsy incarnation
It was a gypsy incarnation
Our gypsy incarnation we loved

Come and find me
I feel your call
Each passing moment
Is much too long, much too long

From our gypsy incarnation
It was a gypsy incarnation
Our gypsy incarnation we loved

From our gypsy incarnation
It was a gypsy incarnation
Our gypsy incarnation we loved",Todd Alan,1981,"[89, 89]",2
500,Spend The Night In Love,"[Hook: P.O.S]
My girl gave me a bolt cutter
We love to break in
Reclaim all the spaces
They forgot they had taken
And all this is ours
It's gonna be what we make it
If only the stars were close enough we would paint them

[Verse 1: Sims]
Yeah
They said we couldn't have that
Said yeah yeah
We going to take it anyway that’s that
Anyways we don't feed out your hand
Look what we built with a grain of sand
It's the end of the golden era
We don't find terror
We define terror
Me and my girl we on the run
But we shoot back when the law man come
Hard to sleep when the darkness creeps
We won't quit till the job is done
We were trying to be quiet
But you incited a riot
Conquer divide it
We learn and applied it
Arrogance, audacity, your love is from a magazine
My love load a magazine
And she be shootin on you mother fucks
Duck

[Verse 2: Dessa]
You know I've seen a little glory
And your trinket isn't it
Save your voice I know the story
Man abandons sinking ship
I heard you did your dissertation
On the rise and fall of man
You said the golden era's over but we'll rise and fall again
We lost some ground, we lost some time
Man look alive we lost enough
Yeah look around we're finders now
Clean that shit up you're losing blood
This ain’t Kansas
Show of hands if you've said your prayers
Now put them down if you've got answers
This place it takes the faith of a man

[Verse 3: Mike Mictlan]
She wants to spend the night in graveyards
Loves fair Plays hard
Look that’s for keeps yeah that’s for keeps
You break my skin with a needle
Break my hand in the face
Questions are equal
Yeah that’s for creeps
There ain't no ground where I’m looking
I climb the twisted stairs it’s funny
Cause I'm so high I’m more twisted
Then when I see your
We're going up to the top
She wants to see our city
Drippin in electric pedals
It's crazy but kinda pretty
Phony, watch your step, follow close
Fuck it if you get caught
The strongest links in the chain are the first to get cut
Together till we all fade
Keep the blade in the gut
They keep us in a cage too long
Don’t think they care about us

[Hook: P.O.S]
My girl gave me a bolt cutter
We love to break in
Reclaim all the spaces
They forgot they had taken
And all this is ours
It's gonna be what we make it
If only the stars were close enough we would paint them

[Verse 4: POS]
Yeah
The sign said something easily forgotten clearly
And time is not my problem she reminds me nearly hourly
I know this till I don't
All rules respected less with every step neglecting
Lessons about trespass
Passing old plans
Lost to the rent
Laugh till we sick
Passing a twist
So savage
We nag at your standards and spit
With a generally messed up view (Says who?)
That handle is safe
And we typically don't give much weight to a life with a worms eye view
We play like birds prey
Any place warm stay love it
We own our space
Roam home
Anyplace aim, go",Doomtree,1981,"[91, 91]",2
501,Once A Night,"Come back to bed
You've been away too long
I need to hold you tight

Can't close my eyes
Til you lay beside me
Warming up the sense through the night

Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
Hold me, show me
Everything's alright
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
And if we get down to it
We can do it twice is right

Spoil me oh so bad
When the day is done
My mind just begs to rest
But I've been saving all the best for last

Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
Just hold me, show me
Everything's alright
Hold me, love me
Do it once a night
And if we get down to it

That you love me, really love me
So touch me tonight
And show me you're not a dream

502,I Can't Stop The Feelin',"[Intro]
Dear Dad
Things didn't turn out quite like I wanted them to
Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode
Everybody want to see you down for the count
But that isn't what being a real man's about
The brave and the bold hang around for the kill
So the bigger the hole, the bigger we fill it
Fill it!
They can hit us with all they got
But cha know what?
What?

[Verse 1]
I can't stop this feeling I got
I feel it right down to my toes
I can't stop this feeling I got
My body got to have it you know
I can't stop this feeling I got
I'll write a letter to the whole world
I can't stop this feeling I got
Every man, woman, boy and girl

[Chorus]
Can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got

[Verse 2]
I can't stop this feeling I got
You know I can't sleep at night
I can't stop, you know I love it a lot
I'm talking about an everlasting light
I can't stop this feeling I got
I get to shaking all in my shoes
I can't stop this feeling I got
The doctor say there's nothing that he can do

[Chorus]
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
Gonna sing it now

[Bridge]
Can't stop
Try to tell me how to paint my palace
That isn't where it's at
That's like trying to tell Columbus that the world is flat
If the song we're singing truly is the best
Then that my brothers is the ultimate test
All in favor say Aye
We can change anything at all
I, I, I can't stop. can't stop
I'm in a butt kicking mood tonight ya'll

[Chorus]
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
(no, no, no, no)
Feeling, feeling, feeling, hey!

[Intrlude]
Hey, pardon me for living, (pardon me for living)
But this is my world, (this is my world)
You can't make me change (you can't make me change)
Maybe we all got to rearrange (rearrange)
Our brains (our brains)
Only we can change the world
Only we can change the world
Only we can change the world

[Chorus]
1, 2, 1, 2, 3
I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got

503,Help Me!,"[Verse 1: Daniel Seavey]
What do I wear?
I only told you 12 times
The first dress that you put on is still your best find
We've been sitting in this dressing room for hours
I need a break baby, I don't have the brainpower

[Pre-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jonah Marais]
When you ask me my opinion
I'm always sure to be your minion
Girl, you're kinda like long division
Everything is difficult

[Chorus: Logan Paul & Why Don’t We]
Help me help you
Girl what you trying to do?
'Cause I don't got a clue
No, I ain't no Scooby Doo
Help me help you
'Cause I'm hungrier than you
I just wanna get some food
And you about to kill my mood
Help me help you
""Do these jeans make me look fat?""
Yeah, I know you want the answer
But I'm smart and that's a trap
Help me help you
Oh, and here's a random fact
You still got my favorite hoodie
And you need to give it back

[Verse 2: Corbyn Besson & Jack Avery]
It ain't that I ain't calling back
It's just you said you needed space
And so I'm staying out your way
It ain't that I ain't got your back
But you went out of your way to make that ""k"" a lowercase

[Pre-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jonah Marais]
When you ask me my opinion
I'm always sure to be your minion
Girl, you're kinda like long division
Everything is difficult

[Chorus: Logan Paul & Why Don't We]
Help me help you
Girl, what you trying to do?
'Cause I don't got a clue
No, I ain't no Scooby Doo
Help me help you
'Cause I'm hungrier than you
I just wanna get some food
And you about to kill my mood
Help me help you
""Do these jeans make me look fat?""
Yeah, I know you want the answer
But I'm smart and that's a trap
Help me help you
Oh, and here's a random fact
You still got my favorite hoodie
And you need to give it back

[Outro: Logan Paul & Why Don't We]
Baby girl, when I ask you if there's a problem
Don't tell me you're fine, I know you're not fine
I just don't understand you, you steal the covers and then you want me to cuddle you are you hot or are you cold?
Don't ask me if I think another girl is cute, that's a loaded question
What are you trying to do?
What are you trying to make me girl?
We're on the same team, so just please
Just listen to me and hear what I have to say, baby girl
Help me help you",Logan Paul,1981,"[98, 97]",2
504,One-Trick Pony,"You say, you're identical to none
But you're identical to some
Who wants to be a some?
Not me

I am not a one-trick pony
I am not a one-trick pony
I really feel no one can own me
I really feel nothing can hold me

Nobody can control me
Nobody can conform me
Nobody can disown me
Nobody can ignore me

So slow down
One-trick pony

I am not a one-trick pony
I am not a one-trick pony
For you I will not dance
And for you I will not prance

And where I was last
I'll never be at
And after that
I've already passed

Slow down
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
(It's got a price tag on it)
And hear this sound
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
(It's what you really wanted)
One-trick pony

Yeah, you do it for a price
I can see it in your eyes
See that role was never mine
I don't want to stand in line
See how that one-trick story goes
If she weren't on top you'd never know
Cause a one-trick pony steals the show

You're just a pony

So back down
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
(It's got a price tag on it)
To the ground
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
(It's got a price tag on it)
And chill out
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)

Girl, you better shape up
Girl, you better shape up
Yeah the ride is so, so, so, so, so fast
Yeah, you better shape up
Yeah, just keep your chin up
No half ass... no half ass

505,Jesse,"[Verse]
What ever happened to predictability?
The milk man, the paper boy, the evening TV?
How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me please
This old world's confusing me

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird who knows your tune
Then a little voice inside you whispers
""Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!""

[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face of somebody who needs you
Everywhere you look

When you're lost out there and you're all alone
A light is waiting to carry you home
Everywhere you look
Everywhere you look
