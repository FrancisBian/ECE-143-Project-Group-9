0,Because I Love You (The Postman Song),"I got your letter from the postman just the other day
So I decided to write you this song
And just to let you know exactly the way I feel
And let you know my love's for real

Because I love you
And I'll do anything
I'll give you my heart, my everything
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide

If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I'll always be around

Because I love you
My heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide

If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose your ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I will always be around

Because I love you
My heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you
I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide",Stevie B,1990,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 27, 37, 50, 61, 80]",13
1,Justify My Love,"[Verse 1]
I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what, so now what?

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

[Verse 2]
I want to know you
Not like that
I don't want to be your mother
I don't want to be your sister either
I just want to be your lover
I want to have your baby
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

[Verse 3]
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Talk to me, tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I want to be your baby

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love
To justify my love
Wanting, to justify
Waiting, to justify my love
Praying, to justify
To justify my love
I'm open, to justify my love",Madonna,1990,"[2, 2, 4, 10, 23, 36, 46]",7
2,From A Distance,"[Intro]
Young Ugly God, bruh
The title explains everything, nigga
I don't got to say shit

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to Dollar General
To buy a pack of Skittles
Then I saw a girl she looked delicious
She walked down my aisle
So I turned around
Then I saw that booty from a distance

[Chorus]
Booty from a distance, booty from a distance

[Interlude]
And don't even act like this message is just for the boys
Girls y'all be looking at ass, too. I be seeing y'all
But you know when you see a big thick booty bitch in the mall
You can't do shit but just look at that booty from a distance

[Verse 1]
Booty from afar, same difference
Young Ugly God spot your booty from a distance
20/20 vision, nigga, I know I ain't trippin'
I just saw a booty from a whole 'nother district
I'm walking in my Sketchers ready for whatever
Booty from a distance, bitch I'm finna bring the pressure
Never disrespect the booty treat it like a treasure
Never disrespect the booty listen to your elders
40 booties from a distance, damn I must be dreamin
I sense another booty from a whole different region
Booty from a distance got me feeling like a demon
Never cuff a bitch, my hoes change like the seasons

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to Dollar General
To buy a pack of Skittles
Then I saw a girl she looked delicious
She walked down my aisle

Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

[Verse 2]
Young Ugly God explore the booty like a forest
My teeny weeny dick came hard like my chorus
Little Dick Clique and I don't wanna be enormous
I open up the booty like a god damn thesaurus
My name is Ugly God but all my hoes is gorgeous
Hoes on my dick cause I just got a abortion
Ugly God get three hoes and have a foursome
I'm ugly but my self esteem higher than your mortgage
Booty from a distance I see booty out in orbit
I could fuck your bitch but your momma more important
Made your bitch come out her shell like a tortoise
Young Ugly God make these other rappers forfeit

[Pre-Chorus]

3,Impulsive,"[Verse 1: 909Memphis]
I know I'm impulsive, I'm sorry
I ain't mean to hurt you, baby, but you know that this not sorry
You know that I'm all about you even though I caught you lyin'
I don't wanna talk about it, baby, you can keep on cryin'

Lately

4,Tom's Diner,"I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee

And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in

""It is always nice to see you""
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella

And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them
Instead, I pour the milk

I open up the paper
There's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of

And I'm turning to the horoscope
And looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me
And so I raise my head

There's a woman on the outside
Looking inside, does she see me?
No, she does not really see me
Cause she sees her own reflection

And I'm trying not to notice
That she's hitching up her skirt
And while she's straightening her stockings
Her hair has gotten wet

Oh, this rain it will continue
Through the morning as I'm listening
To the bells of the cathedral
I am thinking of your voice

And of the midnight picnic once upon a time
Before the rain began...
And I finish up my coffee
And it's time to catch the train",Suzanne Vega,1990,"[5, 5, 7, 9, 12, 19, 24, 31, 38, 46, 57, 70, 87]",13

You are my citadel you are my wishing well my baby blue

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to like liquor to get me inspired
But you look so beautiful, my new supplier
I used to like smoking to stop all the thinking
But I found a different buzz

They bottle it, call it medicine
But I don’t need drugs

You got me you got me good
I’m already high enough

Open the streets and watch our beliefs

'Cause I need freedom, too!

11,"Miracle (From ""Young Guns II"")","The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.

THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)

I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.


(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.

STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay
Tell him he may

HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)",James Joyce,1990,"[12, 12, 13, 18, 18, 22, 30, 35, 41, 47]",10

Hoo! Ha! Hoo!
Hoo! Ha! Hoo!

[Verse 1]
It gets old when you talk to the sun
In a tongue understood by no one
Can it be that I hear what he's saying?
Is there a reason why I'm still awake?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And he says, ""I've got you written in a black book by the railroad track. You see, I know your fate."" (Ooh)
And I say, ""You've got to listen; I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate."" (Oh, oh, oh!)

[Chorus 1]
I'll give you something to believe in (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Burn up a basement full of demons (Oh-oh oh-oh)
Realize you're a slave to your mind, break free
Now give me something to believe in

Just give me (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Just give me something to believe in

[Verse 2]
Everyday when I speak to the moon
Pale as a ghost in the afternoon
Tragedy has a hold of my mind
But I can see the light between the lines

And I say, ""You've got to listen; I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate.""

[Chorus 2]

13,Love Takes Time,"[Verse 1]
I had it all but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

[Bridge]
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do, inside

Love takes time

16,Miles Away,"[Verse 1: Matty Mullins]
I pack my bags and say goodbye to my wife
For what seems like the millionth time
They said it gets easier, but they lied
She looks at me and says ""Really baby, I will be just fine.""
But then she looks away so I don't have to see her cry
And that is when I ask myself

[Chorus: Matty Mullins]
How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, because I left my heart at home
She needs me, but I know they need me too
So God give me the strength to do, what you created me to do

[Verse 2: Matty Mullins]
Well really I'm so thankful for the people I meet, the places I've been and the things I've seen
But when she's not here it doesn't feel like I'm living my dreams
I know they say, that no one is perfect, but I swear she's perfect for me
And that makes it so much harder to leave

[Chorus: Matty Mullins]
How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, because I left my heart at home
She needs me, but I know they need me too
So God give me the strength to do what you created me to do

[Verse 3: Kellin Quinn]
If you miss me, I'm just a phone call away
Please be strong, be strong for me
I need you to show me how to change the inside of me
For my heart, for their sake, please be strong, be strong for me

How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?
When I feel so alone, so alone
How am I supposed to be everything they expect me to be?

19,After The Rain,"The worlds full of pain
Days are the same
Our spirit gets broken but our hope still remains
The worlds full of pain
With nothing to gain
Remember there's always a rainbow shining after the rain

Beware the world, ima put a warning sign up saying ""enter at will""
The scary thrill
That's why people commit suicide by taking every pill
But life ain't about quitting stop bullshitting all the hurting the world's exerting causes burning
Your heart is yearning for not just flirting
Close the curtain these hoes for certain
Take off their clothes and start their earning
That's coz they left school so they stopped their learning
The world is turning
Just remember that

The worlds full of pain
Days are the same
Our spirit gets broken but our hope still remains
The worlds full of pain
With nothing to gain
Remember there's always a rainbow shining after the rain

When the rain is gone the pain may show
This is too much to handle if your brain waves slow
You can't jus forget it coz the way thangs go
Every dead end has a lane that's closed
Remember there's so much to fight for
So many people that you are right for
For every 5 past there'll be 5 more
The life that you live must be what you strive for
Oh, yeah
Find a solution
Gotta dig deeper, behind the pollution
Like the grim reaper, dying's an intrusion
As if you got amnesia, your minds an illusion
You got your hair in a knot and I'm just tying off the loose ends
There's not much difference with you and I
We do what we do, we might choose to lie
But don't be a hypocrite and try to scrutinize
You have brain cells you should try to utilize
Yeah, so just listen when I say that

The worlds full of pain
Days are the same
Our spirit gets broken but our hope still remains
The worlds full of pain
With nothing to gain
Remember there's always a rainbow shining after the rain

Whenever it seems that lifes got you down
Don't frown
Coz somehow you'll find a way to work things out
Remember, your life, what you threw a side
Tried to solve it resulting in suicide
Decisions you make, its what you decide
When you do something you should do it with pride
Try to be lightning in the thunderclouds
Don't wonder how
No time to make any blunders now
The sun comes down
Its time for you to run this town
But always know that you'll find hope
Keep this in mind and you will cope
Forget the pills, razors or rope
Lifes an uphill slope
Should you take your own life? Nope
I don't think so coz

The worlds full of pain
Days are the same
Our spirit gets broken but our hope still remains
The worlds full of pain
With nothing to gain
Remember there's always a rainbow shining after the rain
When you feel the strain
With no one to blame
Remember there's always a rainbow shining after the rain",David Wise,1990,"[20, 20, 24, 30, 35, 41, 48, 56, 75]",9

I mean there's hella dudes, but I'm like hella cute
And I'm like hella sad
'Cause I've been really tryna fuck you like hella bad
But you've been holding back
Is it because I'm black?
Or is it like some family issue you have with your dad?
'Cause I can be that
And you can take my car as long as you bring the keys back
And when you bring them keys back, we can pull these sheets back
And I can show you the true meaning of getting teabagged
Nah, I'm just kidding, that's raunchy
That's not what I'm into
Look, sex is like music, and it's all instrumental
And I'd teach you them chords, just take off them shorts
Now here come the chorus, baby and we can record
Here's a pillow, you gon' need that
Like a shitty mic', like I ain't tryna hear no feedback
See it's a, a synthesize when I'm in between them thighs
A one-take date so we gotta get it right
So many great nights with me watching you on Skype
But the show is always better when you get to see it live
See I'm your biggest fan baby, I'm your biggest fan
I got a ego issue shawty, tell me I'm the man
Tell me how you feel, I'm just tryna understand
Baby you do what you want and I'm just doing what I can

Yeah, doing what I can
You do what you want and I'm just doing what I can

[Anime Interlude: Ako & Riko]

[Verse 2]
So um, let's live happily ever after
They think that they girl's the baddest, we both know your ass is badder
If I lost money I'd be sad, if I lost you girl I'd be sadder
I think we just need our space, we should buy a crib on Saturn
I heard real estate is cheap, health care is actually free
You only swim, you never sink, and Dasani comes out the sink
And all these niggas thirsty babe but you won't let them have a drink
I wish I could say the same, times like this I feel ashamed
One day I know that'll change
Maybe when I'm 25 or maybe when I'm 36 or maybe when I'm 48
Or maybe when I'm 80 we can finally have a baby
And get married and have a nigga like Harry Potter
Similar just to his father
He'll be full of magic yo
In the bed are no magic tricks, I'll teach you some magic though
Yeah I got the magic stick, we should have a magic show
Houdini this weenie, I heard that you got the magic, doe
That's a little rated R, sorry for the little kids
That's how little kids are made, I-D-K what else to say
I been up a hundred nights, thinking of a hundred ways
So when I get the chance I can hit that ass for a hundred days
Baby please

Now first it wasn't easy
Changin' rock and roll and minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now it's so much better (it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (no I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day

23,Just Another Dream,"Waking up in my favorite place
My studio is my new hiding space
This cold dark room is all I need
Won't someone get me off my feet

Got my headphones, and I've got these beats
And no one knows that I'm gone
Well I just wanted to be alone
Just to be alone, yeah just to be alone
Just to be alone, yeah just to be alone
Which way from here shall I go?
And time is lost on this open road
You win or lose, it's just a lesson learned
It's the road I choose, I show no concern
There's a time to live, a time to die
A time to laugh and a time to cry
A time for love, no time for hate
The world can be so heavy, can you feel its weight?
Well now I know, yeah, yes well now I know
Well now I know, yeah, yes well now I know
Things are finally looking up I won't be shot back down

Caught in the middle, what goes around comes around
Are we all just dreaming? Are we all just dreaming?
You can get me high, you can get me low
But you can't tell me how to live my life, you know?

Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush the speaker that booms

Deadly when I play a dope melody

With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends

Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say “Damn!”
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

Trapped in the chains
Of your love, it cuts like a knife
Imagining life without you

I'm up to the challenge
And I'm willing to fight
I'd do anything to have you
With me tonight, oh baby

I'd swim a river
If the river was wide

My love is a fire

It's heaven on earth
And we don't need words
To describe it

I broke every rule before you, girl

Searching for answers
And I've looked high and low
Now that I've found you, girl

37,Knockin' Boots,"(Tone Loc)
Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now

(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you

(Candyman)
At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)

(Candyman)
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2

Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quiet
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl thats irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Asti Spumante
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply
MC Chip, Big Rob and Bud
Rockin on the waterbed, knockin on the rugs
I'm just playing, what I'm saying ain't ill
Girl you should know I'm real

38,Disappear,"[CONNOR]
Guys like you and me
We're just the losers
Who keep waiting to be seen, right?
I mean no one seems to care
Or stops to notice that we're there
So we get lost in the in-between

But
If you can somehow keep them thinking of me
And make me more than an abandoned memory
Well that means we matter too
It means someone will see that you are there

No one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to fade away
No one should come and go
And have no one know he was ever even here
No one deserves to disappear

Cause I need that type of loving in my life

I like a girl with extensions in her hair
Or it could be hers, either way I don't care
Walkin to the laundromat in your uggs and sweats
With ya head scarf on and you still look fresh
And the, latest fashion hood but so classic
You got your own cash, you don't never have to ask
Cause you independent Chanel, Louis, Fendi
And on a light day, you might H&M it, Century 21, can't wait to be 21
And you know everybody so you stay in the loop
Kick it with your home girls after school on the stoop
You can have jays on and you still look cute
This what I like, man what a sight
Such a girly girl but you be ready to fight
Wasn't raised round here but sometimes I stay
So let's hear for the girls from around the world
I've been all, around the world

Hustlers try to kick it to you, every time they drive by
Bye, with the boom and system, if he don't come correct I know you'll dismiss him
Got style, you want you a man but not know
Cause you focused on school, so it's gonna be a while
You can walk with a strut and talk the streets slang
Mary J, Chaka Khan, you still my sweet thang
With a petite frame and your nice round round
From the projects, but you can fit in downtown
Summer time, at the park, while the homeboys ball
Everybody jocking you but it ain’t your fault
Cause they don't do it like you, nah, and you know it
Got a lot of confidence, step afraid to show it
Wasn't raised round here but sometimes I stay
So one time for the girls from around the world

And I finally found my true around the way girl

Didn't never go that far at all

Christmas is coming all the stores are wrapped in their neon glow
But I don't feel festive
Oh I've lost the woman I held so dear
I'm so reflective as I think of all our happy years
I brush against a stranger
So I turn to apologize
And I saw her, with another man, and a sparkle in her eyes

Does she love that man?
The way that I'm loving her still
Does she love that man?
For she has broken my will to survive

I walked to a cafe where I sat and stared at an empty wall
The waitress talked to me, but I could not hear her words at all
The only sound that I could hear was the screaming of my soul
My world revolved around one single thing I wish to know

Does she love that man?
The way that I'm loving her still
Does she love that man?
For she has broken my will to survive

The weather was changing, snow began falling
The sky became dark like the mood of my heart
I watched all the lovers
Sharing together, their smiles and laughter were painful reminders
I seem to recapture the moment I held her
I made her swear that she'd always be there
But she left me sorrow and fear of tomorrow
As soon as I wake there's a pain I can't shake in my heart

Does she love that man?
The way that I'm loving her still
Does she love that man?
For she has broken my will
Does she love that man?
The way that I'm loving her still

Talking bout the ghetto...funky, funky ghetto
Trying to survive, trying to stay alive

The ghetto
The ghetto
(Talking bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouth
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same and it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you bro but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay
Black man trying to break into my house again
Thought he got off dope doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the ghetto

(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto
(Trying to live our lives)
The ghetto
(Won't ya tell 'em 'bout it Too $hort)

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
So just peep the game and don't call it crap
'Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a football team
And her baby died just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house, no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She'd rather spend her money on a H-I-T
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him I'd better help myself
Housing Authority and the O.P.D
All these guns just to handle me in the ghetto...

The ghetto
(People are dyin')
The ghetto
(Children are cryin')
The ghetto
(Don't have enough to eat)
The ghetto
(Don't even have shoes on their feet)

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like TOO $HORT
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(Tryin' to get out of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(But I got no place to go)
The ghetto
(Tryin' to survive in the heart of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Ha, 'cause that's the only place that I know)

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
So much game in a Too $hort rap
Can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you wanna act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short Dog is in the house, you better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black, stand tall and hard
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check
'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen, it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my people try to get out

You gotta love someone

You can stop the world, steal the face from the moon
You can beat the clock, but before high noon
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You need two hearts on one side
When you stand alone and there's no one there
To share the way it feels inside and baby

You can cheat the devil and slice a piece of the sun
Burn up the highway but before you run
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You let someone share the heat
When you're on your own and there's no one there

46,Pray,"[Verse 1]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 2]
You won't find me in church (No)
Readin' the Bible (No)
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end

Get yapped, pay a nigga bread, get ya shit back
Right back, everything could change, just like that
Get pulled over on your way bringin' that white back

50,Where Does My Heart Beat Now,"[Verse 1]
So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed
I feel in your eyes
Always thought of keeping
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

[Verse 2]
Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by hunger
Of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

[Verse 3]
Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Feel it getting stronger and stronger

Ona wybacza moje wady, wybacza błędy
Rozumie moje dziaby i złote zęby
Odbijam zwykłych typów w nich, gdy chcę polatać z nią
Z moją malutką candy, mam od niej plakat z Blow
Bo tylko ona zna mój ulubiony film
I kuma dobrze mój popierdolony styl
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Skarbie jesteś mi potrzebna, gdy nie mam się do kogo odezwać
Gdy cały ten fejm mnie przerasta
I było nie raz tak, już chciałem się chlastać
A wtedy Ty wybaczasz moje wady, wybaczasz błędy
Rozumiesz moje dziaby i złote zęby
Odbijam ten zepsuty świat, gdy idę tędy z Tobą
Z moją malutką candy, którą mam zawsze obok
Bo tylko ona wie w którą stronę chcę iść
I tylko ona zna mój ulubiony hit
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Skarbie jesteś mi potrzebna, gdy nie mam się do kogo odezwać

Skarbie jesteś mi potrzebny, gdy wszystko mi działa na nerwy
Gdy cały ten świat mnie przerasta i było nie raz tak
Już było nie raz tak i wtedy Ty wybaczasz moje wady
Wybaczasz błędy, rozumiesz moje sprawy

61,Heat Of The Moment,"[Verse 1]
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

[Chorus]
She asked me
""Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?""
She asked me
""Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?""
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

[Interlude]
What are we even doing?

[Verse 2]
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, ""You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him""
And I say ""Well, goddamn""

[Chorus]
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

All of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.

66,Shelter Me,"Everybody needs a little place they can hide
Somewhere to call their own
Don't let nobody inside
Every now and then we all need to let go
For some it's a doctor, for me it's rock and roll
For some it's a bottle
For some it's a pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's givin' them a thrill
Others point their finger if they don't like what they see
If you live in a glass house don't be throwing rocks at me

(Chorus)
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper to get us by
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper ohhh and it'll be alright

Check out Mr. Politician in his suit and tie
But when the doors are closed there ain't nothing he won't try
Meanwhile Mr. Medicine's treating his best friend's wife
Tipper led the war against the record industry
She said she saw the devil on her MTV
To look into the cabinet it takes more than a key
Just like Jimmy's skeleton's and his ministry

(Chorus)
For some it's a needle for some it's pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's giving them a thrill

Show me the way

Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way

[Verse 1: Evidence]
I say hello to my people, hello to the day
I watch the world on wheels, hit the yellow and gray
The ones don't work are the ones don't eat
And once again, from the city where that sun don't sleep
It's time to get live because the terms is breached
Ride the wave like the world is a beach, learn more I teach
I was raised by N.W.A and stayed CA
All day, same story, different brief case
I'm nonchalant to others peddling weight
I got a purpose to serving up and settle my state
Been through it, all of it great
Put the ruler to the movement, all of it straight
Big fish? Even calling them bait
One love, one dish, see 'em all on my plate
I'll take the lady on a vacay, she call it a date
Now she calling in sick, now she calling in late

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
I've been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Made it through close calls and lost some ground
It's a hell of a price I pay
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
The moon tagged the sun in, love to be alive
Feet hit the ground running, butterflies in my stomach
Like I'm anxious trying to get it, trying to learn a lot from it
On a planet in regression, in a loft at the summit
Air is much clearer, catch me on the high road
Some fight to live, others settle for survival
It's your world, you can write the line you live your life on
It's heavy but you're strong, just hold on until that light dawns
It's started now, pardon me we're partying
Escalating, redefining the state of the art again
Celebrated, elevators open up to secret floors
Different rules and secret laws, from the roof you'll see the stars
Only fear boredom in a world of raw materials
Excited by potential, inspired by adventure
Calculated circles, the circumference and the radius
The only cats that float without a float through the parade is us

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
I've been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Made it through close calls and lost some ground
It's a hell of a price I pay
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way

[Verse 3]

[Evidence]
It's routine, by the beach I rise
First up, I hit the weed then I bleach my eyes
Then it's to the drum machine to speak my mind
Tracks like fitted hats, pick a beat my size

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Energizing, on the darkest streets I shine
Saw the light up on the mountain, to the peak I climbed
Breathtaking new perspectives on the life I grind
First tear of joy fell, looking like I'm crying
For a just a moment

[Evidence]
The feeling of being content
Not needing a dollar or a cent
Smile for my mama cause she proud
The studio, my headphones loud

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Bridge builders will connect these crowds
Dedicated on my honor you can check these vows
That's purpose, power to make the powerful nervous
Hard work ain't easy but easy usually ain't worth it
They say

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
I've been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Made it through close calls and lost some ground
It's a hell of a price I pay
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way",Dilated Peoples,1990,"[74, 74, 81, 96]",4

Another day, some other way
We're gonna go, but then we'll see you again

Here we go

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind
And why you keep dissing me
Poor little me
And why you have a change of heart
Then turn it all around
And then try to put it on me
Poor little me

But don't you know
I can be a trip
I can make things hard
But baby I believe that you still got a heart
That's why I try to stop myself before I start
'Cause I can make it tough
I can make it rough
But I won't

Well, I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
Baby, work it on
Work it on out

Baby, work it on
Work it on out

Oooh, oooooooooh

[Verse 2]
Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town
And claim that you're missing me
Poor little me
When you knew all the time
That you could've been with your homegirl
Loving and a kissing on me
Sweet little me

But don't you know
If you wanna be a man
You gotta work real hard
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one
And nothing in the world should make us part
'Cause we can make it work
If you take away the hurt from the heart

[Bridge]
(Oh) I can be a trip
But I choose not to
(Oh, oh) Deep inside of you
I think there's still good in you, boy
(Oh) Don't give me no reason not to trust you
(Oh, oh) Just take the benefit
Don't give me no lip
And I'll be sweet to you

I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit

77,Deeper Shade Of Soul,"Mellow...that's my style

Surprise, surprise! So you rub your eyes
Never knew UDS, so cool as ice?
Hear the vibes man, they'll stupefy
Ducks categorize us as hardcriers
That's a lie, we know why we're occupiers
No blurs, but obscure styles, these are higher
Profiles are low - as soon as we go
As a breeze straight from a deeper shade of soul

(Chorus)
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul
A deeper shade of soul, yeah
A deeper shade of soul

Five souls play the head role
Excite the middle between the two poles
The globe rotates from new to old
UDS take both to reach the souls
Narrow mind clydes (suckers!), still holding a pose
What we pour 'n flow when we come close
To the contrary, they pinch their earlobes
They call it rogue-rock, but it's a deeper shade of soul

(Chorus)

We blend everythin', with the color of skin
Under the skin, we're in like Flynn
Ducks stare at us, as soon as we begin
To innovate the frame of thought they're in
Again, music's got to do with only feeling
It's not where you're from, it's 'can' they yield in
The stuff that we rock and what we're giving
A piece of the mind connects with rhythm

78,Get Here,"[Verse 1]
You can reach me by railway
You can reach me by trail-way
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

[Verse 2]
You can reach me by sailboat
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down slow, into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

[Chorus]
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer

[Verse 3]
You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can
Get here if you can",Sam Smith,1990,"[79, 79, 89]",3
79,And So It Goes,"A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see
But like any other house, it's only temporary
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart;
If there's no love inside, it'll soon fall apart

Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love
And so it goes, with everything but love

You can drive around in a long limosine
If you don't know where you're going, it don't mean a thing
He who'd walk a mile, just to hold an empty hand
Knows what it means, to be a wealthy man

Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love
And so it goes, with everything but love

Worldly treasures will all pass away
There's just one thing that's put here to stay

Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love
And so it goes, with everything but love",The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,1990,"[80, 80, 60, 37, 37, 39, 45, 51, 60, 69, 83]",11

Swingin' to the left and swingin' to the right
If I think about baseball, I'll swing all night, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Swingin' in the living room, swingin' in the kitchen
Most folks don't 'cause they're too busy bitchin'
Swingin' in there 'cause she wanted me to feed her

Swingin' to the drums, swingin' to guitar
Swingin' to the bass in the back of my car
Ain't got money, ain't got no gas

I scream, you scream, we all scream for her

It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Niggas don't want war—I'm a martian, with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right; your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite; I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts—like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit time to inaugurate
My P.E.-conglomerates 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame-spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be Simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of Theodora, my heart go
""Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom""
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that 'K
Like every day in every way, and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is, ""Pray""
'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best—I'm like, ""You're so right""
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass-corrupt politician on Wall Street

Fuck that, fuck everything, son
Fuck government, fuck—listenin' and shit

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Stopped spitting fire 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
Wouldn't mind a feign of interest for your finest interest
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
'Cause P.E.'s about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', ""Fuck censorship!""
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
'Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's 'cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond—nigga

84,Melt In Your Mouth,"Mm-hmm...
This one goes out
To all the suckers out there
Who thought I was soft
When I dropped Knockin' Boots
For the ladies
But I'm-a come correct this time
And do something a little bit different
(Who you gonna cook this to, man?)
Mmm, the ladies

Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
The C-A to the -ndy was the M-A-N
I'm like no other man, 'cause you know no other man can
Be an undercover lover and a soul brother man
On the other hand, introduce me to your mother and
I wouldn't be surprised if she's my number one fan
Here I stand a full six-feet-three
And the perfect match has to be when you meet me
Under a palm tree in the middle of the beach
Bring a towel or a sheet like the boots with sand on my feet
After we eat what we brought on the pier
I hear your earrings jingle like a chandelier
As you premiere what you hear is not a simile
But it's meant to be the poetry as me, a K-I-N-G
There'll never be another Candyman
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Lip smacking good, good to the last drop
If I didn't have to go, I know you never would stop
I'm on the top of your list for the best French kiss
I assist on your one last wish, and since
I'm not the type to fall in love on sight
I'm-a let you hold me tight for just one night
Since I write the rhymes to make the whole world sing
It doesn't mean a thing when you call me the king
And bells won't ring 'til I walk down the aisle
You could smile, but that won't be for a long while
It'll take more than a killer behind to change my mind
I'm not blind, I know the time
See, I'm not the kind to write a rhyme while you laugh
Ha, ha, ha, girl, I get half
So as I see it, you don't need a wedding band
'Cause I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Thirst quenching, did I mention
Give a chick an inch and she'll want an extension
Pictured on my heiny right behind me is the man of the house
Suggesting that I burn the hell out
You begin to count, but no doubt, you call my cellular phone
Because I melt in your mouth like a snow cone
On and on as the saga continues
Here's another page on the menu
When you see the Candyman, you see me as a hot hor d'oeuvre
And you got a lot of nerve
First come, first served is the usual procedure
After I tell you that I need you
Featured with any kind of line that I think what's best for you
Because I wanna get next to you
Sex with you is just one small part of the plan
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
The C-A to the -ndy was the M-A-N
I'm like no other man, 'cause you know no other man can

85,This Is Ponderous,"This is ponderous, man, really ponderous

I had this dream the other night
I went to work one day
And nobody remembered who I was
So, I decided to take the day off

On my way out
I run into my boss and he says
Hey, you look familiar
I said, thanks, people say that
A lot in these dreams

Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak

Then all of a sudden
I'm standing on a beach
In some tropical part of the world
And there's this sign that says
'Aren't you supposed to be at work'
Sort of screamed out at me

Then I remembered
I'd been here in other dreams
But usually there was a water polo game
And a girl who could talk with her eyes

And she'd say
'Can you see what I'm saying'
Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak

Before I knew it
I was walking near a lake
When a phone rings
And the operator speaks to me
In a language I don't understand

Oom papachucka maka nanu singow
Meling kapalana wani domo chingpow
Heddy kapalua cuma jenising tea
Oomama chucka pana one is now three

Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak

Before long, I was coming up
On this really weird part of my dream
You know, the part where
I know how to tap dance
But I can only do it
While wearing golf shoes

Now, I'm back on the beach
Walking with this girl
Who talks with her eyes
This time she says
'I think you see what I'm saying'

Then just before I woke up
It started to rain in Southern California

Oom papachucka maka nanu singow
Meling kapalana wani domo chingpow
Heddy kapalua cuma jenising tea
Oomama chucka pana one is now three

'Can you see what I'm saying'

Told you once
You'll never see me cry
I'm not that kind of guy
But I know you're done with excuses, yeah
Once, I saw you say goodbye
I thought twice about that lie
But I know you know what the truth is

[Chorus]
But these old shades
Make me feel safe
And these gold chains
Make me feel brave, baby
It ain't you, so please don't change
I can't be true to no one else
Too busy lying, lying to myself
Lying to myself

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know I'm guilty in this game of love
Of holdin' back, not showing all my cards
I'm terrified what move love's gonna play on us
And I'm sure it just takes courage
But I'm scared to fall that hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Told you once
You'll never see me cry
I'm not that kind of guy
But I know you're done with excuses, yeah
Once, I saw you say goodbye
I thought twice about that lie
But I know you know what the truth is

But these old shades
Make me feel safe
And these gold chains
Make me feel brave, baby

Never will you play with my heart
Missunderstanding I don't know
What you're planning never will you tear me apart
I know I must be dreaming all these brand new friends
And I've never seen such clever ways to make amends
You never know who's scheming is she out for self?
Nowadays you've got to be protected and it's not for health
Don't you know she drives me crazy, does she like my walk
Or maybe all she knows is that money talks money, money, money
It's a shame the way it is I really like her smile
I'd like to get to know her 'cause she drives me wild
Can you tell me why hey, you need diamonds, you need pearls
And I gotta buy 'em, oh I've got to buy 'em

I grew up doing right and I won't throw it out

88,This House,"[Intro]
Lately everyone been talkin' crazy
Feel like everybody's got some shit to say
They misinterpreted my good intentions
And expected I was just gon' step away
If there's a heart that pumps and there's a breath to take
Then I won't bite my tongue as long as I'm awake
And they don't have the guts to make a dumb mistake
I'd rather crash a car than ever touch the brakes

[Verse 1]
I built this fuckin' house
They the kind of people that be dyin' for exposure
They the kind of people that get mad and lose composure
They the kind of people that are never goin' forward
They are just the ones, the ones that are lookin' for apologies
Hatin' real loud but they follow me
Screamin' at the top of their lungs I'm the scum of the Earth
In the same damn breath, tryna preach about equality

[Verse 2]
Back before I wrote the song on race
They all ignored that I had something great
They tried to edge me out, they didn't hear my bars
They tried to tell me that I wasn't built for fame
Fast-forward to when I'm fuckin' paid
I ain't spent a dollar on no fuckin' chain
I'll get my mom a house, I'll get my dad a car
I'll make my sister rich, she'll never work again

[Verse 3]
And this hater shit is so underwhelmin'
I'm conditioned for all of the abuse
Seein' the reaction videos all blowin' up
And you're welcome for all of the views
Blow up my Twitter, y'all just keep makin' me bigger
Y'all just keep showin' you're triggered
Y'all just keep missin' the point and I keep doin' me
Y'all ain't nothin' to even consider

[Verse 4]
Man I built this fuckin' house
I'm the kind of person makin' music with a purpose
You the kind of people that be hatin' on the surface
I'm the kind that you ain't used to, the kind to make you nervous, yeah
Back before I even wrote the record
I could see this comin' like a fortune-teller
And a calm sea don't make a skilled sailor
So I thank the heavens for the stormy weather

[Verse 5]
Okay, fast-forward to when we're old and gray
I'll be lookin' back at when they posted hate
And it will hurt a bit, but it was worth it when
Your dream is gettin' heard no matter what they say
I tried conveyin' that I love us all
And the way I did it left 'em so appalled
I used a broken arm to try and break their walls
No matter what they say they know it took balls

[Verse 6]
I surveyed the land and I found a location
Unloaded the lumber and pounded the stakes in
I blended the bones of the people who hated
With blood and cement then I poured the foundation
I built the frame with all my guilt and shame
And then I chiseled my name and the date in the basement
I carved my initials in all of the boards and the beams
That are needed for structural greatness

[Bridge 1]
No record label, no distribution
No co-sign, no publicists
No manager, no teammates
No money to make up my budget with
No groceries, no studio
No bookin' agent, no bucket list
No PR and no marketin'
Just fans

[Verse 7]
Man we built this fuckin' house
When my days end and it's vacant
And they bury me with that only key
My biggest fan's gonna break in
With a Ouija board and box of chalk
Draw a pentagram, hail Satan
Try to bring me back from that wooden box
Y'all tried to fill my grave with

[Verse 8]
Then they'll sit on the roof with the rifles I hid in the fridge
And they'll shoot at the men on the ridge
Who are comin' to undo the work that I did
Then they'll block-off the highway that leads to the crib
And put sensors on all of the boards on the bridge
So they know when they're comin' to empty the clip
Then they'll gut all the bodies and cut off the skin
Then connect all the pieces with needles and pins
And attach it to ten feet of branches and twigs
And then plant it in mud 'til it stands in the wind
And they'll stand there and look at the shit that we did
That we'd never imagined we'd do 'cause of them

[Bridge 2]
Our blood and sweat and tears went into what we built 'til we were begged
So we used blood and sweat and tears of enemies to build our flag

[Verse 9]
We built this house, we laid these bricks
We set these traps, these flames we lit
Our haters doused in gasoline
They brought to try and torch us with
Heh, let them hate dawg
Everyone will have somethin' to say, dawg
Their opinions don't mean shit
Tryna judge your engine by your paint job
Fuck a gravestone, I'ma cheat death
There's too much I ain't seen yet
They think that I got in way over my head
But I feel like I just got my feet wet
We're tryna dream more but sleep less
Avoid the pills when we're depressed
Remember to not be too hard on ourselves
If we are cut deep enough we all bleed red

[Outro]
Man you never know when it's time to go
Heaven's open when the bars are closed
So seize the moment, don't leave it hopin'
You'll breath tomorrow, you could be a ghost
I'm livin' my life, the finish line is right in front of me
Made of fishin' wire, so I'll never see it 'till it's too late
When God shakes my hand, please celebrate
Please celebrate, please celebrate, please celebrate
Please celebrate, please celebrate, please celebrate",Tom MacDonald,1990,"[89, 89]",2
89,The Swalk,"Yo what you doing here huh?

Nice to see you too okay

Whether in Jamaica or Cancun, Mexico
Baby don't be scurred, shake that ass like Mystikal
We got physical now she calling and beeping
Call when I'm sleepin, call my girl claimin we creepin
Bitch you nuts, look I only fucked you once
How you gone get the message, I ain't called you in months
Acting like Super Dave with them dumb ass stunts
Talking bout girls I could get her whatever she want (Whatever I want)
I'm like girls like you be wanted for warrants
Stalking of course, alone on the phone disguising your voice
Got your girls asking for Kay on the three way
Talking bout (You can't call a bitch on her BDay?)
Hmm, Tanisha its over with stop playin
Nah nah it's over. (So what you saying?)
Look you gotta bounce. (I don't wanna fuck with you)

I'm never letting go
Never letting go

You believe this ho, pop up everywhere I go
Pop up at the show, pop up at the grocery store
Pop up in my kitchen like, ""Oh you wash dishes here?""
Pop up in my bathroom, ""Oh you take pisses here?""
Listen here we gone need some distance here
(Where I'm gone go?) I don't care, just disappear
You ain't my main bitch not even my main squeeze
Anyway, how the fuck you get a set of keys?
First she used them on my crib, then she used them on my whip
And wrote on the side, ""Kanye you ain't shit""
You believe this bitch? Man, did you see this shit!?
Did she just knock my windows out on my Escalade? (Ha yeah nigga!)
That's a twelve fuckin' hundred dollar estimate
She must've took off all yesterday just to hate
Restraining orders ain't stopping her
She the reason caller I.D. so popular
Across the street now with some fuckin binoculars
Screaming at the top of her lungs, ""I'm never letting go!""

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Had enough of the stalker shit got to put her in line
Count back from ten when I got to nine I grabbed mine
Before I gotta do what I gotta do after blue she lying
Like ""Nigga you put your hands on me for the last time""
Tried to get you over your uncles to come and jump me
Take my cash and punk me
With my ass and trump me
I stump them fuckin chunkies
Just look at yo niece
She beat her own ass and called the police
(Pregnant with his baby yeah he still getting rough with me!)
And to my crib scuff me up and put the cuffs on me
My momma dropped that five hundo and got me out of custody
Girl left a note on my door (Nigga don't ever fuck with me)
And all the time I got to thinkin that I'm the man
Hottest nigga on the block and shit I got a fan
I'm like a swole nigga thought that he could lift the van
Somebody please come and take this bitch up off my hands!
You don't understand, man

Uh oh, uh oh, these hoes, these hoes, all the same, all the same
All want a nigga with a chain

Want a nigga banging they brains

90,I Found Love,"I was so young and reckless
It was all a blur but there you were
And your love left me breathless
When the fairy dust fell over us
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

So take my hand, and shed a tear
Before I'm gone, it's now or never
I'll hold you close, the end is near
But love goes on and on forever

It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away

When the sparks, flew between us
I saw you glow, and had to know
Where our journey would lead us
'Til the story end, and back again
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

So lead me home, and lift me up
Above the stars, and even higher
I'm not afraid, because your love
It falls like rain, and burns like fire

It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day to float away

I'll love you forever
And you were my dream come true

91,One More Try,"I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm lookin' out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me
Say you love me
But if you don't
Just let me go

'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me ""No""
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

(Chorus)

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy

92,The Obvious Child,"[Verse 1 - Paul Simon]
I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep through the night
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
But I say why
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

And in remembering a road sign
I am remembering a girl when I was young
And we said these songs are true
These days are ours
These tears are free
And hey
The cross is in the ballpark
The cross is in the ballpark

[Chorus - Paul Simon]
We had a lot of fun
We had a lot of money
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him ""Sonny""
Sonny gets married and moves away
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
Sonny gets sunnier
Day by day by day by day

[Verse 2 - Paul Simon]
I've been waking up at sunrise
I've been following the light across my room
I watch the night receive the room of my day
Some people say the sky is just the sky
But I say:
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

[Bridge - Paul Simon]
Sonny sits by his window and thinks to himself
How it's strange that some rooms are like cages
Sonny's yearbook from high school
Is down from the shelf
And he idly thumbs through the pages
Some have died
Some have fled from themselves
Or struggled from here to get there
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
Runs his hand through his thinning brown hair

[Outro - Paul Simon]
Well I'm accustomed to a smoother ride
Maybe I'm a dog that's lost his bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep the night
Some people say a lie is just a lie
But I say the cross is in the ballpark
Why deny the obvious child?",Paul Simon,1990,"[93, 93, 96]",3

And I want you back
How many times I'm gonna say I'm sorry?

You're all I need, let me show you

They say you can't take it with you
When you go
And I believe it
But taking what I've got
Or being here with you, you know
I'd rather leave it

[Verse 3]
We had a life, we had a love
But you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it
Well that was then and this is now
And I want you back

All these muhfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd

[Verse 1]
Come on, baby girl, tell me what you want, I got what you need
Said she independent, so don’t get offended if she leave
I said I won’t get offended, I’ll just get some Fendi
And repress my emotions in material shit that can be a distraction
Pussy and money, sometimes I feel the satisfaction
Till I spend that bread and bust that nut and now I’m back, son
After the damage is done
Rearrange the game and let 'em know your name

All the pretty girls love the style

[Verse 2]
You know the drill, come on, you know the deal
If my shorty acting up, I wife swap like Uncle Phil
Moving at the speed of sound, let’s slow it down and keep it trill
Yeah, we keep it real, kill 'em with kindness and not the steel
Yeah, we livin' it up, you know that this is my everything, I’m never givin' it up
All the time, all the—all the time (yeah, we do)
And now I feel like I wanna keep going, my cards never showing, don’t know what’s in-hand
I love my fans, but this here girl want me, tell me I’m the man, I know I am
But never acknowledge it
Touring the country, I'm loving these colleges
Touching more pussy than a gynecologist
Study her body like I’m a biologist, with no apology
Baby girl, follow me
She got low, blow my kiss of criminology
And she be loving the way I be flowing
And I know the infatuation is growing
If you catchin' feelings you better be slowin' it down
(""Slowin' it dow—"") slow it down, down
'Cause we both know what happens when that love come around
You feelin' me, I’m feelin' you, I want you to be mine
Maybe one day it will be, but I don’t have the time

Shorty say she love me and she know every word
To every song on every mixtape
""When your album droppin'? Tell me which date
Everything you say to me, I can relate
The fact that we met right here, right now on this night, it must be fate""
Now I’ll be damned, time moves so fast
Couple months back, I had a meeting with my last
Reminiscing 'bout love, discussing matters of the past
Looking in them eyes, but I’m thinking 'bout that ass
I took her for coffee, she took me for granted
Now I show no emotion and my shorty can't stand it
And now you know (And now you know)
I’m on my grind, I keep my exes in line like tic-tac-toe
And I finally got 'em all up out my vision
However, I’m all they see when they turn on the television

It's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
So I don't wanna take that fall
It's a long long long way down

I'm hurt
Love struck me down again
Enticed me in and pulled the pin
Blew my tender heart sky high
Now in my pain I'm asking why
As I'm crying
Should I give it my last try
Or say goodbye

Love is a killer
A homicidal fiend
Love is a killer
It'll be the death of me
I got a target on my back
For a cupid dressed in black
Love is a killer
It's killing me

Love so sweetly beckoning
I've seen your face
Called your name
I tasted tears you cried
Lived in shadows in my mind
Frozen here in time
Don't leave me here to die

Love is a killer

Demand so much of me, yeah

Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping
Yeah, aight, but we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work, be funky

That like to front in their rides

[Verse 1]
You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cause you heard it from hearsay
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly

Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin', and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne?
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin'
I'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drumming
My trunk be shakin', vibratin' and rattlin'
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be babblin'
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin' off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride and my word is bond

Sunroof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means I'm chillin'
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want BASS
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin' loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin' that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

So lonely now, just let me off downtown

Set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free

When I said it was over, you aimed at my heart
Won't be long for I'm leavin', oh my love
But I feel it forever no time in my life
You can call that the livin' on my own so free

[Chorus:]
Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody

[Verse 2:]
You took me easy and then let me go
I never was you see, that cheatin' kind
You feel alright, you never look for me
So long, it's time I gotta get on back

Set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free

When I said it was over, you aimed at my heart
Won't be long for I'm leavin', oh my love
But I feel it forever no time in my life
You can call that the livin' on my own so free

109,Romeo,"[Letra de ""Odio"" ft. Drake]

[Intro: Drake, Romeo Santos]
Yeah, yeah
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tú desvaneces
Y  me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepción
Sé que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdón por hacerte daño

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verso 2: Drake, Drake & Romeo Santos, Romeo Santos]
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Interludio: Romeo Santos & Drake]
Escucha las palabras
Yeah, drizzy Drake

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
Yo fui el llanto, él es tu sonrisa (turn the lights on)
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán muy de prisa

[Verso 3: Drake]
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque él te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida, pero entiendo
Que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí",Romeo Santos,1990,"[99, 80, 61, 52, 41, 23, 11, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 24, 26, 33, 42, 53, 69]",18

The droll delight of deemsterhood, a win from the wood to bond. Like the bright lamps, Thamamahalla, yearin out yearin. Auspicably suspectable but in expectancy of respectable-ness. From dirty flock bedding, drip dropping through the ceil — ing, with two sisters of charities on the front steps and three eva — cuan cleansers at the back gaze, single box and pair of chairs (suspectable), occasionally and alternatively used by husband when having writing to do in connection with equitable druids and friendly or other societies through periods of dire want with comparative plenty (thunderburst, ravishment, dissolution and providentiality) to a sofa allbeit of hoarsehaar with Amodicum cloth, hired payono, still playing off, used by the youngsters for czurnying out oldstrums, three bedrooms upastairs, of which one with fireplace (aspectable), with greenhouse in prospect (par-ticularly perspectable).

And, since threestory sorratelling was much too many, they maddened and they morgued and they lungd and they jowld. Synopticked on the word. Till the Juke done it.
Down.

Like Jukoleon, the seagoer, when he bore down in his perry boat he had raised a slide and shipped his orders and seized his pullets and primed their plumages, the fionnling and dubhlet, the dun and the fire, and, sending them one by other to fare fore fom, he had behold the residuance of a delugion: the foggy doze still going strong, the old thalassocrats of invinsible empores, maskers of the waterworld, facing one way to another way and this way on that way, from severalled their fourdimmansions. Where the lighning leaps from the numbulous; where coold by cawld breide lieth langwid; the bounds whereinbourne our solied bodies all attomed attaim arrest: appoint, that’s all. But see what follows. Wringlings upon wronglings among incomputables about an uncomeoutable (an angel prophetethis? kingcorrier of beheasts? the calif in his halifskin? that eyriewinging one?) and the voids bubbily vode’s dodos across the which the boomomouths from their dupest dupes were in envery and anononously blowing great.

Guns.

Keep backwards, please, because there was no good to gundy running up again. Guns. And it was written up in big capital. Guns. Saying never underrupt greatgrandgosterfosters! Guns. And whatever one did they said, the fourlings, that on no acounts you were not to. Guns.

Not to pad them behaunt in the fear. Not to go, tonnerwatter, and bungley well chute the rising gianerant. Not to wandly be woking around jerumsalemdo at small hours about the murketplots, smelling okey boney, this little figgy and arraky belloky this little pink into porker but, porkodirto, to let the gentlemen pedesta-rolies out of the Monabella culculpuration live his own left leave, cullebuone, by perperusual of the petpubblicities without inwoking his also’s between (sic) the arraky bone and (suc) the okey bellock. And not to not be always, hemmer and hummer, treeing unselves up with one exite but not to never be caving nicely, pre-cisely, quicely, rebustly, tendrolly, unremarkably, forsakenly, hal — tedly, reputedly, firstly, somewhatly, yesayenolly about the back excits. Never to weaken up in place of the broths. Never to vvol-lusslleepp in the pleece of the poots. And, allerthings, never to ate the sour deans if they weren’t having anysin on their consients. And, when in Zumschloss, to never, narks, cease till the finely ending was consummated by the completion of accomplishment.

And thus within the tavern’s secret booth The wisehight ones who sip the tested sooth Bestir them as the Just has bid to jab The punch of quaram on the mug of truth.

K.C. jowls, they’re sodden in the secret. K.C. jowls, they sure are wise. K.C. jowls, the justicestjobbers, for they’ll find another faller if their ruse won’t rise. Whooley the Whooper.

beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was’nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly good reason that he was still such as he was

Danaan googs and the ramblers from Clane and all the rest of the notmuchers that he did not care the royal spit out of his ostensible mouth about, well, what do you think he did, sir, but, faix, he

Your heart's like a wheel
Just waiting to roll
It's longing for freedom
To get out on the road
You're hungry for something
That you may never find
So many reasons
Your love has made you blind
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
So don't leave me standing here
Don't leave me standing here
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care

113,New Power Generation,"[Intro]
Lay down your funky weapon
Yeah y'all, here we go
Pumping the big noise in the 90's

[Verse 1]
Pardon me for living, but this is my world too
I can't help that what's cool to us might be strange to you
Pardon me for breathing, can we borrow some of your air?
The problem with you and your kind is that you don't know love is there

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do

[Verse 2]
Pardon me for thinking, but there's something under my hair
I bet you thought the lights were on but no one's living there
You think that if you tell enough lies they will see the truth?
I hope they bury your old ideas the same time they bury you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do

[Interlude]
We are the new
We are the new, we are the new
Making love and music
New power, we stand

[Verse 3]
Pardon us for caring, we didn't know it was against the rules (shout it out)
If we only want to love one another
Then tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)
No father, no mother, no sister, no brother, nobody can make me stop
Said if you didn't come to party child, I think you better get up of my block

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
Go on and get up off my block
The only thing that's in our way is you
Get up off my block, because
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
Love is there if you'd just open up to it
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do
If you'd just believe your whole world would change

[Outro]
New power generation, you've got to rearrange
We are the new power generation, you've got to give up all the fight
We are the new power generation

114,Praying For Time,"These are the days of the open hand, they will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man, whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way he must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all god's children crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand, oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say ""What's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but i'll take my chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time",George Michael,1990,"[90, 70, 51, 36, 20, 8, 3, 1, 2, 5, 8, 18, 23, 41]",14

I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place

I just knew too much

Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?

You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy

A little more about you

We're gonna stay so true to this relation
Me without your loving
Is such a sad equation, baby

I will keep this love alive, baby
I will

That night we threw down hard like our lives depended on it
Smoke in the eyes, suspended by the moment
I pull my hat low so as not to see nothing but my spit clutching the mic, reflected in the light
Felt like we breathed in electric air from the evening
Exhaled a jewel and left it there
I'm in my own hometown where the drums live
Guitar picker from Phila on some other shit
I smelt Paris in the horn, taste London in the keys
When I'm a Rhymesayer, brothers with me
On a deep cosmos, natural high cool
With God in my ear tellin' me to ride through
I'm ain't trying to hear the playback, jack
I was there in the flesh and I'm blessed that I can say that
You feel it in your chest and play that
You got it in your mind, say that
You can't arrange that

Ah, a good kid at drums is hard to come by

Soaked it all in

Since the choice to rap or just voice the facts
I guess my point is that

Standing on four four beats butt naked
Since around the time Busy Bee was famous, huh

So please rest assured that Ali don't fake shit

127,Let's Try It Again,"[Verse 1]
Old love, why did I have to see you again
After we parted, we said we'd be no more than friends
But that moment I saw your face, I wished that we could erase
The past and start with a love that will surely last

[Verse 2]
Old love (old love, old love) I was once blind (ahh) now I see (now I see)
That no other (old love, old love) boy will ever, ever (ahh) do for me
But this funny feeling I have inside, makes me wish we could compromise
And start anew, and vow to never be untrue

If you give me half a chance I'll try to erase
All the pain (all the pain I've caused you)

Hey, pretty thing, all dressed up
For the main attraction
Like a baby doll looking for love

And she doesn't need a reason
She just hears a calling to the wild, hey, yeah

God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong and to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
You learn to walk and talk and laugh and cry
Work your fingers to the bone till the day you die
And above it all, love is the ritual

Hey, little man, beatin' his chest
And flexing his muscles
Gun for hire, he shoots for a star
Hey, like a handsome prince
Walkin' down the street in his shinin' armor
Romeo in search of his heart

There's a method to this madness
And a message callin' to the wild, hey

God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong and to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
You learn to walk and talk and laugh and cry
Give your heart and soul till the day you die
And above it all, love is the ritual

Come on dance, little sister
Little sister wants to dance
All night looking for true romance
When in a black leather jacket walks little brother
To rock her world, to be her lover

So, signal all the children
Send a message calling to the wild, hey
God gave man the breath of life
To grow up strong and to take a wife
To change the world and love is the ritual
So you walk and talk and laugh and cry
Work your fingers to the bone till the day you die

I felt like a deer in love lights

Lay with the wolves
Alone, it seems
I thought I was part of you

The picture drawn has a dark sky but I see a glimpse of sun
My spirit's clean and I'm true to the cause
Singing for the future so my music can stay alive

I'm lonely with my demons broken is the life I knew
My love is a rock far out in the sea
And your love is the wave crashing into me yeah haa haa oh yeah

Another city to swallow floods of nature must drown this land
But I'm safe in my tower should I lend a helping hand
From the cradle pure and innocent stumbling guilty to the grave
I'll make it through 'cause I'm hungry at heart
Looking for a reason and nothing will pass me by no

Clear starlight moon is bright cold whispering winds are here
My love is a rock far out in the sea
And your love is the wave crashing back at me back at me oh yeah

Promised I'd withstand
Any blaze you blew my way
'Cause something inside
It solidified

You can tear me down

A perfect family
You hold us close for the world to see
And when I say you're the only one I've ever loved
I mean those words truthfully

Your love could disappear
And no, it isn't fair
But I don't care

Friday night and I had the munchies
Filled the cart till it could not take it
One more bag of chips would break it

Went to the cheek out stood in line
Behind me a girl who was just too fine
Got in the ear while they rang the total
Reached for my wallet uh oh a bolo

Not my day I felt like a dummy
Went to the store and forgot the money

Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
In school then she is graduation

Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction

She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain my protection

It was my last and yes it broke

I'm wonderin' if you love me, because you never say
Don't play with my passion, I can't read your mind
Boy let's see some action, show me some kind of sign

If I opened up my heart, would you even know where to start
Am I guessing wrong about your feelings?
Is it all a fantasy, that I think you wanna be?
Explain to my affection, have I got your attention?

[Verse 1: Grigori Rasputin]
Cool mustache, Wario
Try messing with the Mad Monk you'll be sorry, yo
How many dictators does it take
To turn an empire into a union of ruinous states?
It's a disgrace what you did to your own people
Your daddy beat you like a dog and now you're evil
You're from Georgia, sweet Georgia
And the history books unfold ya!
As a messed up motherfucker bent in the mind
Who built a superpower but he paid the price
With the endless destruction of Russian lives
If you're the man of steel I spit kryptonite!
Big dick mystic known to hypnotize
I could end you with a whisper to your wife

[Verse 2: Joseph Stalin]
Look into my eyes you perverted witch
See the soul of the man who made Mother Russia his bitch
You think I give a fuck about my wife?
My own son got locked up in prison, and I didn't save his life
You got off easy when they pickled that moose cock!
I'd leave your neck in a noose, in a trench, and shot!
Your whole family? Shot! All your wizard friends? Shot!
Anyone who sold you pierogi? Shot!
Starve you for days til you waste away
I even crush mother fuckers when I'm laid in state
Pride of Lenin took Trotsky out of the picture
Drop the hammer on you harder than I bitch slapped Hitler

[Verse 3: Vladimir Lenin]
I have no pride for you who ruined everything
My revolution was doing to stop the bourgeoisie!
I fought the bondage of classes, the proletariat masses
Have brought me here to spit a thesis against both of your asses!
Let me start with you there, Frankenstein!
Looking like something out of R.L. Stine
It's hip hop chowder, red over white
Cause the Tsar's wife can't do shit tonight!
And Joseph you were supposed to be my right-hand man
But your loyalty shriveled up like your right hand, man!
Our whole future was bright, you let your heart grow dark
And stopped the greatest revolution since the birth of Marx!

[Verse 4: Mikhail Gorbachev]
Knock knock knock knock
Did somebody say birthmarks?
Yo I'm the host with the most Glasnost
Assholes made a mess and the war got cold
Shook hands with both Ronalds; Reagan and McDonald's, no doubt!
If your name end with 'in', time to get out!
I had the balls to let Baryshnikov dance, playa!
Torn down that wall like the Kool-Aid Man (Oh yeah!)
You two need yoga, you need a shower
And you all need to learn how to handle real power!

[Verse 5: Vladimir Putin]
Did somebody say real power?
Дa, you want to mess with me?
I spit hot borsch when I'm crushing these beats
Blow it up like a tuba while I'm balling in Cuba
Doing judo moves and schooling every communist сука.
I'm a president in my prime, my enemies don't distract me
The last man who attacked me, lived a half-life, so comrade come at me

Fall in love and kiss and smile from every girl walking by

140,Have You Seen Her,"One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park

And have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know, tomorrow is their future
But to me just another day

They all gather around me
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

Well, I know I can't hide from a memory
'Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why, oh why
Did she have to leave and go away, oh yeah
Oh, I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost
Baby, I'm lost

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, she left her kiss upon my lips
But left that break within my heart
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why Oh why?
Did you have to leave and go away? Oh yeah
Ooh oh, I've been used to having someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby I'm lost

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

As another day comes to an end
I'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
Anything that she would send
With all the people I know
I'm still a lonely man
You know, it's funny
But I thought I had her in the palm of my hand

Have you seen her
Tell me, have you seen her (tell me, have you seen her?)

141,Look Into My Eyes,"[Verse 1]
It ain’t hard to tell I got money
You can see it if you’re blind
You can see it when it shine, you see it then it’s mine
Always on my hustle, always on my grind 24/7, 365
Came up off the corner, quarters, nicks, and dimes
Nigga don’t believe me, look into my eyes
Niggas moving pies, niggas losing lives
Niggas doing time, they just tryna’ survive
Niggas talking shit, see me then its fine
Broke and rich nigga, it’s a very thin line
Speeding in my ride, smoking weed, I’m getting high
Hope you niggas fire, gonna need em’ if you try
All black leather, all black Jordan 5's
Money in the bank, kay kay on my mind
Got some niggas that I’m cool with, some gangster ass ties
All my niggas riding, all you niggas smiling

[Hook]
Shades on so them haters can’t look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
So high that they say it’s hard to look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
You’ll see all the shit I been through if you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
You gon’ see a real nigga when you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes

[Verse 2]
My pops tell me I look tired when he look into my eyes
Soon as the cameras come on I know how to look alive
My mom tell me I look stressed when she look into my eyes
So many people in my business I’m just trying to live my life
You can tell I took a dab if you look into my eyes
See them kay kay clouds floating if you look into my ride
Say I look just like Sebastian if you look into my eyes
Know this whole world fucked up so I gotta raise him right
So we rolling, we smoking on that potent
A boss I got my own shit, Breeze holding on that chrome shit
He down to let you hold it, we all the same we close knit
Roll weed up by the ocean, you closing shop we open
We all know that the bullshit be talking and that real shit be walking
It’s a 9-11 I’m parking, you ain't getting money that’s awkward
Probably say I need a day off if you look into my eyes
Niggas faking but I can’t I don’t look good in that disguise

142,All I'm Missing Is You,"Oh!

[Verse 1:]
I got these friends
They walk around so considered
Bragging to the end
Like a car and clothes
Is all that's needed

What about the simple part
Give out of the heart?
Without love
It's never gonna be enough
I got the toys, I got the car
I got the friends
But

Hanging with the boys
Is not the kind of time I want to spend
But I know there's something more
Something I've been waiting for
I knew it was true
The moment I saw you

[Chorus:]
In my heart, in my head
In my life, in my bed
All I'm missing is you

Every day, every night
Of my life would be right
All I'm missing is you
Oh, girl
All I'm missing is you yeah

[Verse 2:]
Doing all I can
But every since I met you, baby
I'm a traveling man
If only else real love can save me

I'm reaching out to you
Baby, what else can I do?
But it's gonna be right
To get you into my life

In this crazy world
I've been searching for the answer
Then I saw you, girl
I found out what my heart's been after

Could have been another day
But if I looked the other way
Then I couldn't have known
What I've been missing all along

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
With all that
I know
Still this
Fill me with you

Girl, you know
I got it going on
But all I'm missing is you

Feel the touch when we kiss
My hands on her hips, fell in love with her lips

We stand tall from beginning to end
With the help from fans and all our friends
Freedom of speech will never die
For us to help, our ancestors died
Don't keep thinking that we will quit
We'll always stand and never sit
We're 2 Live, 2 black, 2 strong
Doing the right thing, and not the wrong
So listen up, y'all, to what we say
We won't be banned in the U-S-A!

Banned in the U-S-A I was
Banned in the U-S-A I was

[Interlude: Various Samples]
Luke's concerts are for adults
If it's an adult show you have to be 18
Our record is a year old, but with all the publicity
There's a lot of people- curiosity is aroused!
We're selling records to a totally different audience
I take a precaution that nobody else has
I stickered my album
I made two versions- two versions- two versions

[Verse 2: Brother Marquis]
The First Amendment gave us freedom of speech
So what you sayin'? It didn't include me?
I like to party and have a good time
There's nothin' but pleasure written in our rhyme
I know you don't think we'll ever quit
We've got some people on our side who won't take your lip
We're gonna do all the things we wanna do
You can't stand to see a brother get as rich as you
This is the 90s and we're comin' on strong
Sayin' things and doin' things that you're sayin's wrong
Wisen up, cause on Election Day
We'll see who's banned in the U-S-A!

Banned in the U-S-A I was

We have the right to say what we want to say

We have the freedom of expression!
We have the freedom of choice!

Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas

Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down

Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Don't break down

160,"King Of Wishful Thinking (From ""Pretty Woman"")","                                                The Third Story

Under Colour Of Confession And Of Exceeding Niceness Of Conscience, A Lady, Being Enamoured Of A Young Man, Bringeth A Grave Friar, Without His Misdoubting Him Thereof, To Afford A Means Of Giving Entire Effect To Her Pleasure

Pampinea being now silent and the daring and subtlety of the horsekeeper having been extolled by several of the company, as also the king's good sense, the queen, turning to Filomena, charged her follow on; whereupon she blithely began to speak thus, ""I purpose to recount to you a cheat which was in very deed put by a fair lady upon a grave friar and which should be so much the more pleasing to every layman as these [—friars, to wit—], albeit for the most part very dull fools and men of strange manners and usances, hold themselves to be in everything both better worth and wiser than others, whereas they are of far less account than the rest of mankind, being men who, lacking, of the meanness of their spirit, the ability to provide themselves, take refuge, like swine, whereas they may have what to eat. And this story, charming ladies, I shall tell you, not only for the ensuing of the order imposed, but to give you to know withal that even the clergy, to whom we women, beyond measure credulous as we are, yield overmuch faith, can be and are whiles adroitly befooled, and that not by men only, but even by certain of our own sex.

In our city, the which is fuller of cozenage than of love or faith, there was, not many years agone, a gentlewoman adorned with beauty and charms and as richly endowed by nature as any of her sex with engaging manners and loftiness of spirit and subtle wit, whose name albeit I know, I purpose not to discover it, no, nor any other that pertaineth unto the present story, for that there be folk yet alive who would take it in despite, whereas it should be passed over with a laugh. This lady, then, seeing herself, though of high lineage, married to a wool-monger and unable, for that he was a craftsman, to put off the haughtiness of her spirit, whereby she deemed no man of mean condition, how rich soever he might be, worthy of a gentlewoman and seeing him moreover, for all his wealth, to be apt unto nothing of more moment than to lay a warp for a piece of motley or let weave a cloth or chaffer with a spinster anent her yarn, resolved on no wise to admit of his embraces, save in so far as she might not deny him, but to seek, for her own satisfaction, to find some one who should be worthier of her favours than the wool-monger appeared to her to be, and accordingly fell so fervently in love with a man of very good quality and middle age, that, whenas she saw him not by day, she could not pass the ensuing night without unease. The gentleman, perceiving not how the case stood, took no heed of her, and she, being very circumspect, dared not make the matter known to him by sending of women nor by letter, fearing the possible perils that might betide. However, observing that he companied much with a churchman, who, albeit a dull lump of a fellow, was nevertheless, for that he was a man of very devout life, reputed of well nigh all a most worthy friar, she bethought herself that this latter would make an excellent go-between herself and her lover and having considered what means she should use, she repaired, at a fitting season, to the church where he abode, and letting call him to her, told him that, an he pleased, she would fain confess herself to him. The friar seeing her and judging her to be a woman of condition, willingly gave ear to her, and she, after confession, said to him, 'Father mine, it behoveth me have recourse to you for aid and counsel anent that which you shall hear. I know, as having myself told you, that you know my kinsfolk and my husband, who loveth me more than his life, nor is there aught I desire but I have it of him incontinent, he being a very rich man and one who can well afford it; wherefore I love him more than mine own self and should I but think, let alone do, aught that might be contrary to his honour and pleasure, there were no woman more wicked or more deserving of the fire than I. Now one, whose name in truth I know not, but who is, meseemeth, a man of condition, and is, if I mistake not, much in your company,—a well-favoured man and tall of his person and clad in very decent sad-coloured raiment,—unaware belike of the constancy of my purpose, appeareth to have laid siege to me, nor can I show myself at door or window nor go without the house, but he incontinent presenteth himself before me, and I marvel that he is not here now; whereat I am sore concerned, for that such fashions as these often bring virtuous women into reproach, without their fault. I have whiles had it in mind to have him told of this by my brothers; but then I have bethought me that men oftentimes do messages on such wise that ill answers ensue, which give rise to words and from words they come to deeds; wherefore, lest mischief spring therefrom and scandal, I have kept silence of the matter and have determined to discover it to yourself rather than to another, at once because meseemeth you are his friend and for that it beseemeth you to rebuke not only friends, but strangers, of such things. I beseech you, therefore, for the one God's sake, that you rebuke him of this and pray him leave these his fashions. There be women enough, who incline belike to these toys and would take pleasure in being dogged and courted by him, whereas to me, who have no manner of mind to such matters, it is a very grievous annoy.' So saying, she bowed her head as she would weep. The holy friar understood incontinent of whom she spoke and firmly believing what she said to be true, greatly commended her righteous intent and promised her to do on such wise that she should have no farther annoy from the person in question; and knowing her to be very rich, he commended to her works of charity and almsdeeds, recounting to her his own need. Quoth the lady, 'I beseech you thereof for God's sake, and should he deny, prithee scruple not to tell him that it was I who told you this and complained to you thereof.' Then, having made her confession and gotten her penance, recalling the friar's exhortations to works of almsgiving, she stealthily filled his hand with money, praying him to say masses for the souls of her dead kinsfolk; after which she rose from his feet and taking leave of him, returned home. Not long after up came the gentleman, according to his won't, and after they had talked awhile of one thing and another, the friar, drawing his friend aside, very civilly rebuked him of the manner in which, as he believed, he pursued and spied upon the lady aforesaid, according to that which she had given him to understand. The other marvelled, as well he might, having never set eyes upon her and being used very rarely to pass before her house, and would have excused himself; but the friar suffered him not to speak, saying, 'Now make no show of wonderment nor waste words in denying it, for it will avail thee nothing; I learnt not these matters from the neighbours; nay, she herself told them to me, complaining sore of thee. And besides that such toys beseem not a man of thine age, I may tell thee this much of her, that if ever I saw a woman averse to these follies, it is she; wherefore, for thine own credit and her comfort, I prithee desist therefrom and let her be in peace.' The gentleman, quicker of wit than the friar, was not slow to apprehend the lady's device and feigning to be somewhat abashed, promised to meddle no more with her thenceforward; then, taking leave of the friar, he betook himself to the house of the lady, who still abode await at a little window, so she might see him, should he pass that way. When she saw him come, she showed herself so rejoiced and so gracious to him, that he might very well understand that he had gathered the truth from the friar's words, and thenceforward, under colour of other business, he began with the utmost precaution to pass continually through the street, to his own pleasure and to the exceeding delight and solace of the lady. After awhile, perceiving that she pleased him even as he pleased her and wishful to inflame him yet more and to certify him of the love she bore him, she betook herself again, choosing her time and place, to the holy friar and seating herself at his feet in the church, fell a-weeping. The friar, seeing this, asked her affectionately what was to do with her anew. 'Alack, father mine,' answered she, 'that which aileth me is none other than yonder God-accursed friend of yours, of whom I complained to you the other day, for that methinketh he was born for my especial torment and to make me do a thing, such that I should never be glad again nor ever after dare to seat myself at your feet.' 'How?' cried the friar. 'Hath he not given over annoying thee?' 'No, indeed,' answered she; 'nay, since I complained to you of him, as if of despite, maybe taking it ill that I should have done so, for every once he used to pass before my house, I verily believe he hath passed seven times. And would to God he were content with passing and spying upon me! Nay, he is grown so bold and so malapert that but yesterday he despatched a woman to me at home with his idle tales and toys and sent me a purse and a girdle, as if I had not purses and girdles galore; the which I took and take so ill that I believe, but for my having regard to the sin of it and after for the love of you, I had played the devil. However, I contained myself and would not do or say aught whereof I should not first have let you know. Nay, I had already returned the purse and the girdle to the baggage who brought them, that she might carry them back to him, and had given her a rough dismissal, but after, fearing she might keep them for herself and tell him that I had accepted them, as I hear women of her fashion do whiles, I called her back and took them, full of despite, from her hands and have brought them to you, so you may return them to him and tell him I want none of his trash, for that, thanks to God and my husband, I have purses and girdles enough to smother him withal. Moreover, if hereafter he desist not from this, I tell you, as a father, you must excuse me, but I will tell it, come what may, to my husband and my brothers; for I had far liefer he should brook an affront, if needs he must, than that I should suffer blame for him; wherefore let him look to himself.' So saying, still weeping sore, she pulled out from under her surcoat a very handsome and rich purse and a quaint and costly girdle and threw them into the lap of the friar, who, fully crediting that which she told him and incensed beyond measure, took them and said to her, 'Daughter, I marvel not that thou art provoked at these doings, nor can I blame thee therefor; but I much commend thee for following my counsel in the matter. I rebuked him the other day and he hath ill performed that which he promised me; wherefore, as well for that as for this that he hath newly done, I mean to warm his ears[158] for him after such a fashion that methinketh he will give thee no farther concern; but do thou, God's benison on thee, suffer not thyself to be so overcome with anger that thou tell it to any of thy folk, for that overmuch harm might ensue thereof unto him. Neither fear thou lest this blame anywise ensue to thee, for I shall still, before both God and men, be a most constant witness to thy virtue.' The lady made believe to be somewhat comforted and leaving that talk, said, as one who knew his greed and that of his fellow-churchmen, 'Sir, these some nights past there have appeared to me sundry of my kinsfolk, who ask nought but almsdeeds, and meseemeth they are indeed in exceeding great torment, especially my mother, who appeareth to me in such ill case and affliction that it is pity to behold. Methinketh she suffereth exceeding distress to see me in this tribulation with yonder enemy of God; wherefore I would have you say me forty masses of Saint Gregory for her and their souls, together with certain of your own prayers, so God may deliver them from that penitential fire.' So saying, she put a florin into his hand, which the holy father blithely received and confirming her devoutness with fair words and store of pious instances, gave her his benison and let her go. The lady being gone, the friar, never thinking how he was gulled, sent for his friend, who, coming and finding him troubled, at once divined that he was to have news of the lady and awaited what the friar should say. The latter repeated that which he had before said to him and bespeaking him anew angrily and reproachfully, rebuked him severely of that which, according to the lady's report, he had done. The gentleman, not yet perceiving the friar's drift, faintly enough denied having sent her the purse and the girdle, so as not to undeceive the friar, in case the lady should have given him to believe that he had done this; whereat the good man was sore incensed and said, 'How canst thou deny it, wicked man that thou art? See, here they are, for she herself brought them to me, weeping; look if thou knowest them.' The gentleman feigned to be sore abashed and answered, 'Yes, I do indeed know them and I confess to you that I did ill; but I swear to you, since I see her thus disposed, that you shall never more hear a word of this.' Brief, after many words, the numskull of a friar gave his friend the purse and the girdle and dismissed him, after rating him amain and beseeching him occupy himself no more with these follies, the which he promised him. The gentleman, overjoyed both at the assurance that himseemed he had of the lady's love and at the goodly gift, was no sooner quit of the friar than he betook himself to a place where he made shift to let his mistress see that he had the one and the other thing; whereat she was mightily rejoiced, more by token that herseemed her device went from good to better. She now awaited nought but her husband's going abroad to give completion to the work, and it befell not long after that it behoved him repair to Genoa on some occasion or other. No sooner had he mounted to horse in the morning and gone his way, than the lady betook herself to the holy man and after many lamentations, said to him, weeping, 'Father mine, I tell you now plainly that I can brook no more; but, for that I promised you the other day to do nought, without first telling you, I am come to excuse myself to you; and that you may believe I have good reason both to weep and to complain, I will tell you what your friend, or rather devil incarnate, did to me this very morning, a little before matins. I know not what ill chance gave him to know that my husband was to go to Genoa yestermorn; algates, this morning, at the time I tell you, he came into a garden of mine and climbing up by a tree to the window of my bedchamber, which giveth upon the garden, had already opened the lattice and was for entering, when I of a sudden awoke and starting up, offered to cry out, nay, would assuredly have cried out, but that he, who was not yet within, besought me of mercy in God's name and yours, telling me who he was; which when I heard, I held my peace for the love of you and naked as I was born, ran and shut the window in his face; whereupon I suppose he took himself off (ill-luck go with him!), for I heard no more of him. Look you now if this be a goodly thing and to be endured. For my part I mean to bear with him no more; nay, I have already forborne him overmuch for the love of you.' The friar, hearing this, was the wrathfullest man alive and knew not what to say, except to ask again and again if she had well certified herself that it was indeed he and not another; to which she answered, 'Praised be God! As if I did not yet know him from another! I tell you it was himself, and although he should deny it, credit him not.' Then said the friar, 'Daughter, there is nothing to be said for it but that this was exceeding effrontery and a thing exceeding ill done, and in sending him off, as thou didst, thou didst that which it behoved thee to do. But I beseech thee, since God hath preserved thee from shame, that, like as thou hast twice followed my counsel, even so do thou yet this once; to wit, without complaining to any kinsman of thine, leave it to me to see an I can bridle yonder devil broke loose, whom I believed a saint. If I can make shift to turn him from this lewdness, well and good; if not, I give thee leave henceforth to do with him that which thy soul shall judge best, and my benison go with thee.' 'Well, then,' answered the lady, 'for this once I will well not to vex or disobey you; but look you do on such wise that he be ware of annoying me again, for I promise you I will never again return to you for this cause.' Thereupon, without saying more, she took leave of the friar and went away, as if in anger. Hardly was she out of the church when up came the gentleman and was called by the friar, who, taking him apart, gave him the soundest rating ever man had, calling him disloyal and forsworn and traitor. The other, who had already twice had occasion to know to what the monk's reprimands amounted, abode expectant and studied with embarrassed answers to make him speak out, saying, at the first, 'Why all this passion, Sir? Have I crucified Christ?' Whereupon, 'Mark this shameless fellow!' cried the friar. 'Hear what he saith! He speaketh as if a year or two were passed and he had for lapse of time forgotten his misdeeds and his lewdness! Hath it then escaped thy mind between this and matinsong that thou hast outraged some one this very morning? Where wast thou this morning a little before day?' 'I know not,' answered the gentleman; 'but wherever it was, the news thereof hath reached you mighty early.' Quoth the friar, 'Certes, the news hath reached me. Doubtless thou supposedst because her husband was abroad, that needs must the gentlewoman receive thee incontinent in her arms. A fine thing, indeed! Here's a pretty fellow! Here's an honourable man! He's grown a nighthawk, a garden-breaker, a tree-climber! Thinkest thou by importunity to overcome this lady's chastity, that thou climbest up to her windows anights by the trees? There is nought in the world so displeasing to her as thou; yet must thou e'en go essaying it again and again. Truly, thou hast profited finely by my admonitions, let alone that she hath shown thee her aversion in many ways. But this I have to say to thee; she hath up to now, not for any love she beareth thee, but at my instant entreaty, kept silence of that which thou hast done; but she will do so no more; I have given her leave to do what seemeth good to her, an thou annoy her again in aught. What wilt thou do, an she tell her brothers?' The gentleman having now gathered enough of that which it concerned him to know, appeased the friar, as best he knew and might, with many and ample promises, and taking leave of him, waited till matinsong[159] of the ensuing night, when he made his way into the garden and climbed up by the tree to the window. He found the lattice open and entering the chamber as quickliest he might, threw himself into the arms of his fair mistress, who, having awaited him with the utmost impatience, received him joyfully, saying, 'Gramercy to my lord the friar for that he so well taught thee the way hither!' Then, taking their pleasure one of the other, they solaced themselves together with great delight, devising and laughing amain anent the simplicity of the dolt of a friar and gibing at wool-hanks and teasels and carding-combs. Moreover, having taken order for their future converse, they did on such wise that, without having to resort anew to my lord the friar, they foregathered in equal joyance many another night, to the like whereof I pray God, of His holy mercy, speedily to conduct me and all Christian souls who have a mind thereto.""

170,Hold On,"[Verse 1]
Loving and fighting
Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Verse 2]
Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Bridge]
I don't wanna let go
I know I'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you
Saying ""baby, let's go home""
Let's go home
Yeah, I just wanna take you home

171,Violence Of Summer (Love's Taking Over),"[Verse 1]
Pick it up
This'll get you out of your head
China's hanging out by the railings
Of the motorshed
She goes with a real hit biker
He's a metalhead
She looks me up and down
Talking dirty eyes
Sweet saying boy baby
I could lick ya any time
Keep it up
That's right...here we go again
Bit later I'm going to run
Into her round the back
While other guys break heads
In the Sugar Shack
Don't give me drink I don't want to
Get too stoned
Then we're going to see who's going to
Take who home

[Chorus]
The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover

[Verse 2]
Those lips will make me rise
You may look down but don't think twice
Slow death is on the way
So what man I still want to play
One, two
This'll get you out of your mind
This'll get you up...let's go
Maybe take a ride going south
Where her mother writes
Before bad news catches up
We still got a little time
We'll leave it all so far away
One thing is sure we shouldn't stay
I take it all little Chine going to
Get the runaround a run... a runaround

173,Innocent,"[Verse 1]
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd

Who you are is not what you did

My life reflects the meaning that it had the day before
And I wonder, is this as good as it gets?
I take a ride downtown with my fair-weather friends
And I wonder, is this what it means to have regrets?
Another day to waste
Another dollar to spend

I can hear the voices, but the words they don't make sense
Talking for hours, but the conversation's meaningless
And I wonder, does anybody even notice?
I take a walk so I can think, the silence fills me up
And I wonder, would anybody even notice?
If tomorrow came and I was gone away
I was gone forever

Since I'm self-unsure, damaged and impure
I just meant that no one's happy anymore
It's all over, it's all over
It's everywhere, it's all over
But you don't want anymore that I've ever had before
Fill me up, but still I'm empty

Come and gather stones (?)
Lying to the wall (?)
Surrounded, but we're all alone
It's all over, it's all over
It's everywhere, it's all over
But since I'm self-unsure, damaged and impure
Why is no one happy anymore?
It's not over, it's not over
I pray and share, it's not over
But reaching out for more, something too in store
Feelings that have all but left me

It's emptiness that fills me (x3)

[Verse 1]
I got real bored on a friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company, that's right!

[Chorus]

And you know that I'm talkin' about the...

Got to make some love tonight
And you know I got the look

[Verse 2]
I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride
She said, ""How much money you make?""
Let's just say it'll be more money...

I took her to my crib and I laid her down
Her body felt kinda right
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell, I figured that was what she liked
I said ""Baby, don't get too comfortable, 'cause I really like to sleep alone
Leave your number on the table by my data bank. I love you, but you got to go""

1989 the number another summer (get down)
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hitting your heart cause I know you got soul
(Brothers and sisters, hey)
Listen if you're missing y'all
Swinging while I'm singin'
Giving whatcha gettin'
Knowing what I knowin'
While the Black band's sweating
And the rhythm rhymes rolling
Got to give us what we want
Gotta give us what we need
Our freedom of speech is freedom of death
We got to fight the powers that be
Lemme hear you say
Fight the power

Fight the power

[Verse 2]
As the rhythm's designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhyme's
Designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the pride's arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make ya tough
From the heart
It's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange
People, people we are the same
No we're not the same
Cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless
You say what is this?
My beloved let''s get down to business
Mental self defensive fitness
(Yo) bum rush the show
You gotta go for what you know
To make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be
Lemme hear you say
Fight the power

Fight the power
We've got to fight the powers that be

Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me you see
Straight up racist that sucker was
Simple and plain
Motherfuck him and John Wayne
Cause I'm Black and I'm proud
I'm ready and hyped plus I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps
Sample a look back you look and find
Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check
Don't worry be happy
Was a number one jam
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here
(Get it) let's get this party started right
Right on, c'mon
What we got to say
Power to the people no delay
Make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be

My world ain't no good without you

So if you want to come along
You gotta promise you won't say anything
Cause this guy don't dance
And the word's been passed this is our last chance

We gotta stay cool tonight, Eddie
Cause man, we got ourselves out on that line
And if we blow this one
They ain't gonna be looking for just me this time

And all we gotta do is hold up our end
Here stuff this in your pocket
It'll look like you're carrying a friend
And remember, just don't smile
Change your shirt, cause tonight we got style

Well Cherry says she's gonna walk
Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it
But Eddie, man, she don't understand
That two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket

And tonight's gonna be everything that I said
And when I walk through that door
I'm just gonna throw that money on the bed

Oh, oh
Love makes no promises

[Verse 1]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?

[Pre-Chorus]
How, tell me how will I know?
Will my heart make me believe it so?
Or can I trust the way I feel?
If you could read my mind (If you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew)
You see how hard I have tried (If you only knew, if you only knew)
Still, I can't decide

[Chorus]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?
Tell me could this be love?
El amor no hace promesas

[Verse 2]
Do you know if it's true?
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky?
And do you know (Do you know) if you can fall for just a moment?
Is a moment for all time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why, why am I so unsure?
Is that love knocking at my door?
Or the sound of my beating heart?
If you could read my mind (If you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew)
You know I just can't hide (If you only knew, if you only knew)
What I feel inside

183,We're All In the Same Gang,"[Intro]
Gun is Cocked and Fired
I'm King News and I come to you with the truth
The mean streets took six more lives overnight
All the result of gang-bang stupidity
By the way, you gangsters should know
One of your victims was a three-year-old girl
Well, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?

(With your bad self)

[Verse 1: King Tee]
It's straight up madness everywhere I look
Used to be a straight A student, now he's a crook
Robbing people just to smoke or shoot up
Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-butt
Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang
Hanging on the streets selling 'caine
To his own people
Now when I say people I mean color
You a stupid mother-
I'm trying to stress the fact that you're dumb
Get yourself presentable, son, and just come
Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late
A message from King Tee The Great

[Verse 2: Body & Soul]
Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth
It's time we start being good mothers from the birth
Of our children, no time for sleeping
Teach them to fight and win for the right reason
It's your time, it's your life, live it
Proud to be black, young and gifted
Lifted by the knowledge and taking the right route
Gang violence needs to be wiped out
A-L-M-I-G-H-Ty and E-Z-I-R-E
We see the F-U-T-U-R-E
Should be a positive thing
Body & Soul and you, we're in the same gang

[Verse 3: Def Jef]
One and the same
Everyone came in the same chains
Caught with the same aim
Brain games and names changed
To protect the innocent by-stander
Lies, slander and the master-planner
Destroy the black male
Crack jail and semi-automatic
For static if the crack fails
So since we all talk the same slang
Stop killin, my brother, cause we're all from the same gang

[Chorus]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Make the change cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 4: Tone-Loc]
Now as a youth I used to get my bang on
And on the ave get my part-time slang on
Doing time for me was no joke though
They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco
Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin sporty
Low ridin and tossin up a forty
Thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us
The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles
I found life was much more suitable
Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful
I ain't slippin or down with a head trip
I'm talkin to all the Bloods and all the Crips
Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man
It's time to fight, unite and be a black man
Tone-Loc is on a positive change
Cause remember, we're all in the same gang

[Verse 5: Above The Law]
Bein' the pimps that we are
We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far
Here at home in the ghettos of LA
Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day
Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats
But fools just lay and prey on the weak
It don't depend on the color of a rag
Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have
Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs
And gangs that bang
Most times it's a political thang
Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped
And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped
But they don't because they want it like that
Because the system been set up to hold us back
Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever
So why don't we stick together?
(You got it)

[Verse 6: Ice-T]
Ice-T rippin the microphone the way I do
Listen close, my brothers, cause I'm talkin to you
The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle
Cause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild
I say job, you say ([Hen-G:] bad joke
I rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke)
Livin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane
You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain
I got an idea, give me a minute
And if it makes sense, then get with it
What if we could take our enemies, feed em poison
Undereducate their girls and boys and
Split em up, make em fight one another
Better yet, make em kill for a color
All my brothers need to know one thing
No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang

[Chorus]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Stop the fighting
(Make the change)
Because we're all in the same gang

[Verse 7: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers
We're telling like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister
Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken
A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking
Yo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying
Lying in the streets, that's why we're trying
To stop it from falling apart and going to waste
And keeping a smile off of white face
N.W.A never preaching, just teaching
The knowledge of the streets to each and
All that don't understand, that's why we came
To let you know that we're all in the same gang

[Verse 8: JJ Fad]
The J double, F, the a, the d, that is
And if you want the solution to the quiz
What's black and black, yo, and kills another?
An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother
But another
So now it's time we evolve
And get together and solve it
Cause the world is revolvin
Around a terrible situation
One will kill another for a reputation
So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same
Yo Train, tell em (We're all in the same gang)

[Verse 9: Young MC]
Brothers killin' other brothers
I thought the idea was to love one another?
Open up the paper to one more death
If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left
I try my best to set an example
Sayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples
Not just a brag or to boast but to inform
Cause we're livin in the calm before the storm
You see, I believe that the children are the future
But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya?
We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed
And I want to see all young people succeed
Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10
Just go to work and not the state pen
Cause you live better when you're out there free
And that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC

[Verse 10: Digital Underground]
I'm in a rage
Oh yeah? Yo, why is that G?
Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage
I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news
We prove them suckers right and I got the blues
America
Get busy, Humpty
The red, the white, the blue and
The blue and the red
For Crips and Bloods
The white for who's got you doin
Time bustin caps on one another
The Underground's down for peace among brothers
Kill a black man?
What?
Yo, what are you retarded?
Tell em, Hump
Yo, do you work for the Klan?
Do what ya like
Unless you like gangbangin
Let's see how many brothers leave us hangin

[Verse 11: Oaktown's 3.5.7.]
The gang that should hang is the one that contains
The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind
Now listen, get loose, it's unity time
Yeah, yeah
Peace is a presence that we all need
The future's in our hands, in word and deed
I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD
We're 3.5.7. totally

[Verse 12: MC Hammer]
Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9
All the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line
Now on this tip they started runnin at the lip
Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip
Hit the block about 12 on the tick
The windows went down and the nines went click
People started yellin, bodies started bailin
Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and
It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence
Peace in the hood and a moment of silence
We got together not for ego or fame
We got involved cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 13: Eazy-E]
Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out
And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out
I'm not tryin to tell ya what to do
You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to
You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong
Now your mother's singing that sad song
(My baby ain't never hurt nobody!)
But he still got smoked at BeBe's party
But you're not the first or the last
You're nothin but a short story from the past
You're dead now, not number one but a zero
Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero

But every night every night
Just proved me wrong
Had to think I had heaven
Right here in my hand
And oh, just let it slip away like sand
Oh, gimme one chance to make it right
One more chance
One more chance back in your light

I wanna get back with you
Hold me just like before

185,Cuts Both Ways,"[Verse 1:]
It cuts both ways

That cuts both ways
It's driven deep into my heart each time
That I realize
How it cuts both ways

Can't be together
Cannot live apart
We're heading straight into a broken heart
But I can't stop

[Chorus:]
'Cause I feel too much to let you go
I'm hurting you and it's hard I know
To stay and fight for what we've got
Knowing it'll never be good enough

'Cause you and I are dangerous
We want too much and life ain't that way
Don't ask for more
Don't be a fool
Haven't we already broken every rule

[Verse 2:]
It cuts both ways
We're in too deep for sorry alibis
Can't have regrets or even question why
We can't say goodbye
Because it cuts both ways

No more illusions of the love we make
No sacrifice would ever be too great
If you would just stay

[Repeat Chorus:]

And not be satisfied

To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I
Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

[Verse 2]
Through this world I stumble
So many times betrayed
Trying to find an honest word
To find the truth enslaved

Oh you speak to me in riddles
And you speak to me in rhymes
My body aches to breathe your breath
Your words keep me alive

To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away

Wipe away the tears

Into this night I wander
It's morning that I dread
Another day of knowing of
The path I fear to tread

I follow without pride

I took the pain you caused me and
I put it in a song instead instead

Gonna learn to fly again
May be hard, may be hard, but I'll do it
When I'm back on my feet again
Soon these tears will all be dryin'
Soon these eyes will see the sun
Might take time, might take time,but I'll see it
When I'm back on my feet again

When I'm back on my feet again
I'll walk proud down that street again
And they'll all look at me again
And they'll see that I'm strong, oh

Gonna hear the children laughing
Gonna hear the voices sing
Won't be long, won't be long 'til I hear them
When I'm back on my feet again
I'm gonna feel the sweet light of heaven
Shining down its light on me
One sweet day, one sweet day I will feel it
When I'm back on my feet again

When I'm back on my feet again
I'll walk proud down that street again
And they'll all look at me again
And they'll see, that I'm strong

And I'm not gonna crawl again
I will learn to stand tall again
No, I'm not gonna fall again

192,The Other Side,"[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need
So come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

[Verse 2: Phillip Carlyle]
Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

[Chorus: Phillip Carlyle]
Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine
I don't need to see the other side

[Verse 3: P.T. Barnum]
Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays

[Phillip Carlyle]
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

[P.T. Barnum]
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll
Wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

[Bridge: Phillip Carlyle]
Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

[P.T. Barnum]
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

[Phillip Carlyle]
I wasn't born this morning, 18 would be just fine

[P.T. Barnum]
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime

[Phillip Carlyle]

[P.T. Barnum]
I'd do eight

[P.T. Barnum]
Maybe nine

[Chorus: Both]
Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side
So if you do like I do
(P.T: to the other side)
So if you do like me
(P.T: We're going to the other side)

197,"It Must Have Been Love (From ""Pretty Woman"")","THE little town of B——, consisting of two or three crooked streets, was sound asleep. There was a complete stillness in the motionless air. Nothing could be heard but far away, outside the town no doubt, the barking of a dog in a thin, hoarse tenor. It was close upon daybreak.

Everything had long been asleep. The only person not asleep was the young wife of Tchernomordik, a qualified dispenser who kept a chemist's shop at B——. She had gone to bed and got up again three times, but could not sleep, she did not know why. She sat at the open window in her nightdress and looked into the street. She felt bored, depressed, vexed . . . so vexed that she felt quite inclined to cry—again she did not know why. There seemed to be a lump in her chest that kept rising into her throat. . . . A few paces behind her Tchernomordik lay curled up close to the wall, snoring sweetly. A greedy flea was stabbing the bridge of his nose, but he did not feel it, and was positively smiling, for he was dreaming that every one in the town had a cough, and was buying from him the King of Denmark's cough-drops. He could not have been wakened now by pinpricks or by cannon or by caresses.

The chemist's shop was almost at the extreme end of the town, so that the chemist's wife could see far into the fields. She could see the eastern horizon growing pale by degrees, then turning crimson as though from a great fire. A big broad-faced moon peeped out unexpectedly from behind bushes in the distance. It was red (as a rule when the moon emerges from behind bushes it appears to be blushing).

Suddenly in the stillness of the night there came the sounds of footsteps and a jingle of spurs. She could hear voices.

""That must be the officers going home to the camp from the Police
Captain's,"" thought the chemist's wife.
Soon afterwards two figures wearing officers' white tunics came into sight: one big and tall, the other thinner and shorter. . . . They slouched along by the fence, dragging one leg after the other and talking loudly together. As they passed the chemist's shop, they walked more slowly than ever, and glanced up at the windows.

""It smells like a chemist's,"" said the thin one. ""And so it is! Ah,
I remember. . . . I came here last week to buy some castor-oil.
There's a chemist here with a sour face and the jawbone of an ass!
Such a jawbone, my dear fellow! It must have been a jawbone like
that Samson killed the Philistines with.""
""M'yes,"" said the big one in a bass voice. ""The pharmacist is asleep.
And his wife is asleep too. She is a pretty woman, Obtyosov.""
""I saw her. I liked her very much. . . . Tell me, doctor, can she possibly love that jawbone of an ass? Can she?""

""No, most likely she does not love him,"" sighed the doctor, speaking as though he were sorry for the chemist. ""The little woman is asleep behind the window, Obtyosov, what? Tossing with the heat, her little mouth half open . . . and one little foot hanging out of bed. I bet that fool the chemist doesn't realise what a lucky fellow he is. . . . No doubt he sees no difference between a woman and a bottle of carbolic!""

""I say, doctor,"" said the officer, stopping. ""Let us go into the shop and buy something. Perhaps we shall see her.""

""What an idea—in the night!""

""What of it? They are obliged to serve one even at night. My dear fellow, let us go in!""

""If you like. . . .""

The chemist's wife, hiding behind the curtain, heard a muffled ring. Looking round at her husband, who was smiling and snoring sweetly as before, she threw on her dress, slid her bare feet into her slippers, and ran to the shop.

On the other side of the glass door she could see two shadows. The chemist's wife turned up the lamp and hurried to the door to open it, and now she felt neither vexed nor bored nor inclined to cry, though her heart was thumping. The big doctor and the slender Obtyosov walked in. Now she could get a view of them. The doctor was corpulent and swarthy; he wore a beard and was slow in his movements. At the slightest motion his tunic seemed as though it would crack, and perspiration came on to his face. The officer was rosy, clean-shaven, feminine-looking, and as supple as an English whip.

""What may I give you?"" asked the chemist's wife, holding her dress across her bosom.

""Give us . . . er-er . . . four pennyworth of peppermint lozenges!""

Without haste the chemist's wife took down a jar from a shelf and began weighing out lozenges. The customers stared fixedly at her back; the doctor screwed up his eyes like a well-fed cat, while the lieutenant was very grave.

""It's the first time I've seen a lady serving in a chemist's shop,"" observed the doctor.

""There's nothing out of the way in it,"" replied the chemist's wife, looking out of the corner of her eye at the rosy-cheeked officer. ""My husband has no assistant, and I always help him.""

""To be sure. . . . You have a charming little shop! What a number of different . . . jars! And you are not afraid of moving about among the poisons? Brrr!""

The chemist's wife sealed up the parcel and handed it to the doctor.
Obtyosov gave her the money. Half a minute of silence followed. . . .
The men exchanged glances, took a step towards the door, then
looked at one another again.
""Will you give me two pennyworth of soda?"" said the doctor.

Again the chemist's wife slowly and languidly raised her hand to the shelf.

""Haven't you in the shop anything . . . such as . . ."" muttered Obtyosov, moving his fingers, ""something, so to say, allegorical . . . revivifying . . . seltzer-water, for instance. Have you any seltzer-water?""

""Yes,"" answered the chemist's wife.

""Bravo! You're a fairy, not a woman! Give us three bottles!""

The chemist's wife hurriedly sealed up the soda and vanished through the door into the darkness.

""A peach!"" said the doctor, with a wink. ""You wouldn't find a pineapple like that in the island of Madeira! Eh? What do you say? Do you hear the snoring, though? That's his worship the chemist enjoying sweet repose.""

A minute later the chemist's wife came back and set five bottles on the counter. She had just been in the cellar, and so was flushed and rather excited.

""Sh-sh! . . . quietly!"" said Obtyosov when, after uncorking the bottles, she dropped the corkscrew. ""Don't make such a noise; you'll wake your husband.""

""Well, what if I do wake him?""

""He is sleeping so sweetly . . . he must be dreaming of you. . . .
To your health!""
""Besides,"" boomed the doctor, hiccupping after the seltzer-water, ""husbands are such a dull business that it would be very nice of them to be always asleep. How good a drop of red wine would be in this water!""

""What an idea!"" laughed the chemist's wife.

""That would be splendid. What a pity they don't sell spirits in chemist's shops! Though you ought to sell wine as a medicine. Have you any vinum gallicum rubrum?""

""Yes.""

""Well, then, give us some! Bring it here, damn it!""

""How much do you want?""

""Quantum satis. . . . Give us an ounce each in the water, and afterwards we'll see. . . . Obtyosov, what do you say? First with water and afterwards per se. . . .""

The doctor and Obtyosov sat down to the counter, took off their caps, and began drinking the wine.

""The wine, one must admit, is wretched stuff! Vinum nastissimum! Though in the presence of . . . er . . . it tastes like nectar. You are enchanting, madam! In imagination I kiss your hand.""

""I would give a great deal to do so not in imagination,"" said
Obtyosov. ""On my honour, I'd give my life.""
""That's enough,"" said Madame Tchernomordik, flushing and assuming a serious expression.

""What a flirt you are, though!"" the doctor laughed softly, looking slyly at her from under his brows. ""Your eyes seem to be firing shot: piff-paff! I congratulate you: you've conquered! We are vanquished!""

The chemist's wife looked at their ruddy faces, listened to their chatter, and soon she, too, grew quite lively. Oh, she felt so gay! She entered into the conversation, she laughed, flirted, and even, after repeated requests from the customers, drank two ounces of wine.

""You officers ought to come in oftener from the camp,"" she said; ""it's awful how dreary it is here. I'm simply dying of it.""

""I should think so!"" said the doctor indignantly. ""Such a peach, a miracle of nature, thrown away in the wilds! How well Griboyedov said, 'Into the wilds, to Saratov'! It's time for us to be off, though. Delighted to have made your acquaintance . . . very. How much do we owe you?""

The chemist's wife raised her eyes to the ceiling and her lips moved for some time.

""Twelve roubles forty-eight kopecks,"" she said.

Obtyosov took out of his pocket a fat pocket-book, and after fumbling for some time among the notes, paid.

""Your husband's sleeping sweetly . . . he must be dreaming,"" he muttered, pressing her hand at parting.

""I don't like to hear silly remarks. . . .""

""What silly remarks? On the contrary, it's not silly at all . . . even Shakespeare said: 'Happy is he who in his youth is young.'""

""Let go of my hand.""

At last after much talk and after kissing the lady's hand at parting, the customers went out of the shop irresolutely, as though they were wondering whether they had not forgotten something.

She ran quickly into the bedroom and sat down in the same place. She saw the doctor and the officer, on coming out of the shop, walk lazily away a distance of twenty paces; then they stopped and began whispering together. What about? Her heart throbbed, there was a pulsing in her temples, and why she did not know. . . . Her heart beat violently as though those two whispering outside were deciding her fate.

Five minutes later the doctor parted from Obtyosov and walked on, while Obtyosov came back. He walked past the shop once and a second time. . . . He would stop near the door and then take a few steps again. At last the bell tinkled discreetly.

""What? Who is there?"" the chemist's wife heard her husband's voice suddenly. ""There's a ring at the bell, and you don't hear it,"" he said severely. ""Is that the way to do things?""

He got up, put on his dressing-gown, and staggering, half asleep, flopped in his slippers to the shop.

""What . . . is it?"" he asked Obtyosov.

""Give me . . . give me four pennyworth of peppermint lozenges.""

Sniffing continually, yawning, dropping asleep as he moved, and knocking his knees against the counter, the chemist went to the shelf and reached down the jar.

Two minutes later the chemist's wife saw Obtyosov go out of the shop, and, after he had gone some steps, she saw him throw the packet of peppermints on the dusty road. The doctor came from behind a corner to meet him. . . . They met and, gesticulating, vanished in the morning mist.

""How unhappy I am!"" said the chemist's wife, looking angrily at her husband, who was undressing quickly to get into bed again. ""Oh, how unhappy I am!"" she repeated, suddenly melting into bitter tears. ""And nobody knows, nobody knows. . . .""

""I forgot fourpence on the counter,"" muttered the chemist, pulling the quilt over him. ""Put it away in the till, please. . . .""

And at once he fell asleep again.",Anton Chekhov,1990,"[99, 93, 92, 76, 55, 42, 33, 26, 17, 11, 6, 2, 2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 16, 22, 29, 34, 49, 67]",25

Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty
Cause where we stayin, niggas look shady
But they can't fade South Central
Cause bustin a cap is fundamental
Peepin' out every block close
Seein which one will clock the most
Yeah this is the one no doubt
Bust a U, Bone, and let's clear these niggas out

Ay ay man, whassup nigga?
Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga!
*gun shots*

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Now clearin em out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took their corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slangin in the Valley
Triple the profit makin more than I did in Cali
Breakin off rocks like Barney Rubble
Cause them mark-ass niggas don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Getting bitches and they can't stand a
Nineteen-ninety-one Tony Montana
Now the shit's like a war
Of gang violence, where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gat bust
Four Jheri curl niggas kickin up dust
And some of them are even lookin up to us
Wearing our colors and talkin that gang fuss
Giving up much love
Dyin for a street, that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong
So you know the phrase, once again it's on

[TV announcer]
Top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central, Los Angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings have migrated into East St. Louis, leaving three dead and two others injured. No arrests have been made. Police say this is a nationwide trend, with similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma
(""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere!"")

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
(BOOM) My homie got shot he's a goner, black
St. Louis niggas want they corner back
Shooting in snowy weather
It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together
Fuckin police got the 4-1-1
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun
But we ain't thinkin, bout the boys
Feudin, like the Hatfields and McCoys
Now the shit's gettin tricky
Cause now they lookin for the colors and the Dickies
Damn, the spot's gettin hot from the battle
About to pack up and start slangin in Seattle
But the NARCs, raid about six in the morning
Try to catch a nigga when he's yawnin
Put his Glock to my chest as I pause
Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers
Tryin to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin a fuck
The fool must be sparkin
Talkin about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand, G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride don't like no side
And it's a riot if anyone of us die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's summer vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
Cause look at the motherfuckin years that I'm facin
I'mma end it like this cause you know what's up
My life is fucked

[Man and (Police)]:
Police, eat a dick straight up
(Look here you goddamn nigga, you're not gafflin nobody
You fuckin' understand me? [Kick his ass, put him down]
That's right, get down on the goddamn ground NOWWWW! Fuckin move, NOWWW! [Let me take a shot at him])

201,She Ain't Worth It,"[Intro: Bobby Brown]
Better make tracks
Fast on the double
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Verse 1: Glenn Medeiros]
You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind

But she just got an attitude
Leads you on
Then leaves you blue
Can't you see
She's really just a waste of time

One day
She'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think
Your love will win her in the end
Think again

[Chorus:]
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief
That she's been putting you through
Ooh

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me
I know
I know better than
Better than, better than
Bet, bet better than you

[Verse 2: Glenn Medeiros]
She gets you hot
Then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
Cause she knows
You'll always give her one more try

You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me
Do you really like standing in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Glenn Medeiros:]
I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
(That would be a lie)

Cause there's no one
In this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied I know
Cause I tried

[Rap: Bobby Brown]
Jump in
One thing I hate
Is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
Cause I've tried to make you mine

For the last time
So take this here as a dis
And a goodbye

She ain't worth it
Even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip
And get a grip quick

Fast in a hurry
Cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Bridge: Glenn Medeiros]
Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

202,Stranger To Love,"Was suffocating
And then you gave me life
And now I pray for
For only you inside
Can't put my thumb on
Exactly how I feel
It's unfamiliar but pleasently surreal
Keep putting smiles on my face
I'm constantly amazed by what you do
And I can't keep up with my heart
It's beating me into someone brand new
I love how you just know
How bad I need to take this slow
Like I'm a stranger to love
Restore my strength and manage to kiss me weak
You woke up the woman and put the girl to sleep
HEY! YEA!
Keep putting smiles on my face
I'm constantly amazed by what you do
And I can't keep up with my heart
It's beating me into someone brand new
I love how you just know
How bad I need to take this slow
Like I'm a stranger to love
Everyday I get down on my knees
And Pray, Baby
I'm thanking God
For sending you to me
And it's only getting better, better
Never knew love could take me this far
Keep putting smiles on my face
I'm constantly amazed by what you do
I can't keep up with my heart
It's beating me into someone brand new
I love how you just know
How bad I need to take this slow
And how you always see the beautiful
Beautiful in me
You can always have any woman in this world
But you chose me, me, me
Showed me how to let go
But I'll never let go of you

But you chose me
Showed me how to let go

We could sail away
Or catch a freight train
Or a rocketship into outer space
Nothin' left to do
Too many things were said
To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did
Seasons must change
Separate paths, separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain

I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, that's okay

Down from L.A
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

That's alright, that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
Thats's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away

Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, let's turn the page

And it goes this way

I can tell you that ain't my woman
It's just not her style
I can tell you, because I'm her man

She found a perfect body with a Maserati right outside
And then she chartered a Lear when she heard her career was in danger
And gave the pilot somethin' extra for a perfect ride

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
That's not her style
I can tell you, because I'm her man

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
You know it's not her style
I can tell you, because I'm her man

It's not that she's never done something crazy, done somethng wild
It's just that she's better at doing whatever suits her style
And that's not her style, no, no, no, no, no

I've read where it's said that she sleeps in a bed made of satin
She's had her face done in every place you can try
They say she gets a piece of every lease in Manhattan
And says she's thirty when she's really pushing forty-five

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
It's just not her style
I can tell you, 'cause I'm her man

That's not her style
I can tell you that ain't my woman
It's just not her style

209,Step By Step,"[Intro]
Oh
Ciao Mario
Fre' com'è?
Ti dico solo che
Son venuto a Corni oggi
È degenerata e devo ancora dormire

[Strofa 1: Bresh]
Sto contando i giri che la terra compie nell'arco di un anno
Mentre passa il tempo filtrano gli amici scarto quelli a babbo
Non è novità, se dal basso fra' poi nasce un bastardo
Questa polvere non migliora ma vola come a maggio
Come in moto corro, come treno torno
Ma non mi aspettare che non ti riprendo
Muri di cemento dalle parti
Questo amaro freddo mi ha ghiacciato il petto
La mia civiltà fa pubblicità
Con gli occhi coperti dalla bella vita
Non conosco fra' solidarietà
Se negli anticorpi sgamo un parassita
Temo sia finito il tempo, pure 'sta canna è finita
Fermo a motore spento, tengo il mio girovita

[Bridge: Bresh]
Non hai parole per distrarci
Non basterebbe neanche il meglio che hai
Fra tutti i posti in cui potevo finire a cacciarmi
Fare i normali non ci è piaciuto mai

[Ritornello: Tedua]
Perché quando mi chiama lei
Sento dei presentimenti
E per certi versi io pretendo apprezzi
Beh, che fare
Non ho un re di cuori
Con te che mi pare
A guardie fai nomi
Loro non hanno capito che sopra al set
Questo spartito cosa direbbe?
Beh, vedi te
Non servirebbe deridere
Fuori dal gregge correre che
Non ci potranno correggere

[Strofa 2: Tedua]
Tedua, fuori siamo fiori
Non ho fori sul muro
Se mi curo il culo, paraculi
Avete scudi, scusi
Siamo cugi, stiamo cuci-nando curvi
E la schiena ci si piega in QT
Danna ad altrui
Appunti, scritte ed ardui ahh
Risarcisca il danno fatto
La perquisa trae in inganno
Mentre me la fa il mio fra' la sta spargendo
Fuori peso in pieno autunno
L'uso delle parole è essenziale, sensuale
Senza un senso sensoriale
È tentare di internare in te il male
Per un testo intenzionale, ah beh
La mia gang sta volando, cazzo
Dobbiamo passare un altro step by step
O ai re dei re sarò l'erede del drepa mio pazzo
A te che nella scena fai il boss
Ma non hai scomodato il culo
So che vuoi un po' del mio flow
Ma non è in comodato d'uso

[Ritornello: Tedua]
Perché quando mi chiama lei
Sento dei presentimenti
E per certi versi io pretendo apprezzi
Beh, che fare

You treat me like a fool

Now I don't know what to do
I thought that when you gave me love
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was re-aranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie

Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
Cause your just bad of the heart
You never played the game to smart
Cause you know your bad

When I was by your side
You kissed and told me lies
You hurt me each and everyday

I made it through the night
Lying to myself, why did it have to be this way
I thought that when you gave me love
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was re-aranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie

212,Do You Remember?,"[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years

221,Same Old Look,"The years in our lives go by
Looking back, I still wonder how you are
Will you still remember me
Are you the same, have you changed
Since we`ve been apart
I miss the way that you used to look at me
A child-like look in your eyes
It is too much to ask to
Think of me sometime
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
There`s something that the years cannot disguise
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
I close my eyes and I see
Through the miles to lose time
A search through my distant past
The face holds a shadow of a child
That used to be a best friend of mine
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
There`s something that the years cannot disguise
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
What became of simple dreams we shared
We grew past the love that showed we cared
We found life in reflections of the last days of a child
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
There`s something that the years cannot disguise
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes
Not everybody changes
Have you still got that same old look in your eyes

Tryna stuff as much as I can in these britches
Made your bitch fuck on my friend, it's no difference
I ain't never popped no Xan, I sip sizzurp

If I put it on a song, I seen it or been through it
I can't put it in my song, I know how the feds move
Scream free all of the ahks but I ain't no FamGoon
Gave my mama ten bands, sent her to Cancún
Got the crowd goin' dumb but I ain't no damn fool

Got a quarter million dollars in a book bag
New Era, I'm a dope boy, no cap
I'm living my best life for real
Just left the dealership, no tag
If we opposite, it won't work, it won't last
Get an opposite knocked off, toe tag
Ain't been home in a month, got my ho mad
They need me in the trap but I can't go back
I jumped off the porch with a hundred dollar slab
I got M's in the bank, give a damn what they think
Every vibe I ever shot my shot at, caught it
Everything you ever seen me riding in, bought it

Put my craft into rap then I took off, yeah

223,U Can't Touch This,"[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

[Verse 1]
My, my, my my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Chorus]
I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks, and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move outta yo seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on!
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

[Chorus]
Yo, I told you (Can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucka (You can't touch this)

[Verse 3]
Give me a song, or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

[Chorus]
That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 4]
Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

[Chorus]
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 5]
Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

224,Ready Or Not,"[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyuping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats, I make tracks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty, like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo; I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these scars I got
Oh, baby, hey, baby, ‘cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know
Oh baby, hey baby, you can't hide from the block, oh no

[Verse 3: Pras with Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly!)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border, like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill (Wyclef)]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ay, yo nobody move)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ay, yo nobody move)
Gonna find you and make you want me (Come on)

225,The Humpty Dance,"[Verse One: Shock G as Humpty Hump]
All right! Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny—but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

[Verse Three]
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say 'ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty'
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water
Holy water

[Verse 1]
Back when Michael Jordan was raw
'92 was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em
Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
Return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's
Then you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4's
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin' on my car cause

Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian
Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission
Trynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her
And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain
Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide
Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies
Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!

Who's a dancin' on the table right in front of you
She works all day in her old man's store
But she don't get enough, she wanna earn some more

Daddy's little angel's tongue in cheek
So by the end of the week, she close the boutique
Change her name, that's part of the game
While her daddy sits and wonders who's the hell to
Blame

Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here
Do you wanna dance here, wanna take a chance tonight
Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here
Do you wanna dance here, wanna make romance tonight

Oh, oh she's in the spotlight!
She's all lips and hips
She knows how to use 'em to make you flip
Lips and hips

And she gets ya with a wink of a fingertip
Lips and hips
You can tell that she knows how to give a kiss
Lips and hips
When she's found the target, she never miss

Now did I ever tell ya about the tattoo on her breast
She's got a tattoo on her breast tattooed by the best
It keeps rockin' from the East to the West
And she don't try to hide it by the way she's dressed

When she comes walking straight up to the table
Like a boy in a cradle you begin to shake
It's not only the time that gets hard for you
When she whispers in your ear you'll...

Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here...

It seems years since you held the baby
While I wrecked the bedroom
You said it was dangerous after Sunday
And I knew you loved me
He thinks I just became famous
And that's what messed me up
But he's wrong
How could I possibly know what I want
When I was only twenty-one?
And there's millions of people
To offer advice and say how I should be
But they're twisted
And they will never be any influence on me
But you will always be
You will always be

If I treated you mean
I really didn't mean to
But you know how it is
And how a pregnancy can change you

[Verse 2]
I see plenty of clothes that I like
But I won't go anywhere nice for a while
All I want to do is just sit here
And write it all down and rest for a while
I can't bear to be in another city
One where you are not
I would return to nothing without you
If I'm your girlfriend or not

[Chorus]
Maybe I was mean
But I really don't think so
You asked if I'm scared
And I said so

[Verse 3]
Everyone can see what's going on
They laugh `cause they know they're untouchable
Not because what I said was wrong
Whatever it may bring
I will live by my own policies
I will sleep with a clear conscience
I will sleep in peace

[Chorus]
Maybe it sounds mean
But I really don't think so
You asked for the truth and I told you

230,Holding My Heart,"My walk is insideme
A tenuous stream
Not water but heartbeats
Pulsing mymeaning
A rush like a river
A run frommysource
Desire invents it
And pride makes it worse

Knowingmynature
And knowing that sometimes
With life's complications
Emotions run wild
I need You holding myheart

If I fall on the journey
A limp seems to shame
But defences are crutches
That are keeping me lame

So I've got to have you
Like music must play
Like night needs the day for definition
And can't get away

Knowing my nature
And knowing that now and then
I'm prone to be restless
And given to sin
I need You holding my heart

Not knowing the future
And knowing thepast
May burn in my memory
And threaten to last
I need You holding my heart
I need You holding my heart",Judy Bailey,1990,"[100, 93]",2
231,Club At The End Of The Street,"[Verse 1]
When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand
There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

[Chorus] [x2]
That's where we meet[x2]
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

[Verse 2]
From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye
In this smoky room
There's a jukebox plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light
There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping
Lord have mercy
You can't sit still[x2]",Elton John,1990,"[90, 69, 63, 57, 42, 28, 30, 35, 35, 39, 45, 55, 65, 74, 76, 86]",16

Aw, I knew it. I knew it. I KNEW IT
Another B girl
Yo I think it's about time
We gonna tell Slim about ourselves

[Verse 1]
Now let's bring up the subject
[?] Which we brought to mind
Let's discuss the ""B"" girls
Cause they're one-of-a-kind

Now you can [?]
Wherever you go
Put 'em in your black Benz
Or your blue Bronco

[?]
Everything is chill
With the A C pushin'
In your automobile
You call yourself a lady?
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain

[Hook]
""B"" stands for:
Broncos, Benz, BMW, bass, bangles and a pair of bars
When you see us pulling up down the Ave
You'll act like we are stars

We're not tryin' to make a joke
We're just tryin' to make it known
That people of the world that we call ""B"" girls
Like bars on a Cadillac Brougham.

[Verse 2]
Now that ain't it, and I believe
That we had to rehearse
Another rhyme on the line
For the second verse:
About a girl in the city
Her name is Judy
Had breasts like Dolly
With a big old booty

Well she was [?]
And everything was in place
She was my girl for two years
And [?] doctor [?]

When I took her to [?]
She was frontin' 'bout my Nova
And she wanted a Benz

She said ""We need a Benz""
And all of a sudden, I paused -
Who did Judy think I was?
Santa Claus?
You call yourself Judy
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I was pushin' on my rims
With no context [?]
It wasn't BMW
It was BMX
When I seen a young thing
Comin' down the Ave
And I knew from the moment
She's the girl I'd have
So I slammed on the brake
And I asked her name
She said, ""My name is Janet
But my friends call me Jane.""

I said, ""Well Jane, I'm Prince
Can we be friends?""
She said
""Yes, if you could change a BMX to a Benz!""
You call yourself Jane
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now me and [?] was at the beach
With a couple of friends --
I parked my Nova by a Bronco
And a baby blue Benz
And pass [?] bottles [?]
So I said, [?]
Already drunk from an overdose
Of malt liquor beer

She turned around
And had a nice figure
She said, ""Can't you see me walkin' my nigga?""

""Hey, so? He's a punk!"" [?]

She said, ""I know he's a punk though
But you in a Nova
And he's in a Bronco!""

She came in my face, she kept yakkety-yakkin'
That's when I popped the trunk, I put the clip in the MAC-10

I'm tired of you ""B"" girls
Yeah, that's your name!

And if you don't know what 'B' means
Let us explain:

237,All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You,"It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""

Of this lethally evil force
This is serious so give me a quarter

Call April O'Neil in on this case, and
You'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste!

Determined to put these crooks in jail
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened
But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and got caught!
Yeah, she was all alone
With no friends, and no phone
Now this was beyond her worst dreams
Cause she was cornered by some wayward teens
Headed by Shredder they were anything but good
Misguided, unloved, they called them The Foot
They could terrorize and be angry youths, and
They mugged the people. Who needed proof?
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound!
Shouted ""Cowabunga!"" as they hit the ground
From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower

Heroes on a half shell, they're on a mission

That they stayed at home, instead of fightin'

Splinter's the teacher so they are the students
Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and Donatello
Make up the team with one other fellow
Raphael. He's the leader of the group
Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop
Pizza's the food that's sure to please
These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese
Back to the story, it's not hard to find
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind
Those are the words that their master instructed
But a letter from Shredder has Splinter abducted
That was the last straw, spring into action
Step on The Foot, now they're gonna lose traction
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice
Your shell is hard so you shout, ""They can't dust us off!
Like some old coffee table.""
Since you've been born you've been willing and able
To defeat the sneak, protect the weak
Fight for rights and your freedom to speak
Now the villain is chillin' so you make a stand
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand
Remember the words of your teacher, your master:
Evil moves fast, but good moves faster
Than light, shining for your illumination
Good versus evil equals confrontation
So when you're in trouble
Don't give in and go sour

Twilight sings a song
All the happiness that used to be

Soon my eyes will close
Soon I'll find repose
And in dreams
You're always near to me

I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Someone took you right out of my arms
Still I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine

They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

[Pre-Chorus]
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Verse 2]
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind

Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate

That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State

I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed

But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself

Now that, my friend, is very hard to do.""

Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives
And for that live moment we thrive
Awakenings, as we make the dead come alive
Rise and walk my son, come into the light
Inside the dark we illuminate mics
Give knowledge to mediocre, the wheel to neanderthal
Filter to the the smog, digital to analog
We steady advancing, rhyme enhancing
Simple minds can't keep up with this

{​Verse 1: Senim Silla}​
Dig - I'ma put it on the table
I ain't a thug nigga and playa, I ain't playful
I'm just Senim Silla, man without label
Standing on my own two, you're trying to stay stable
Speaking what I know to only what I'm able
I ain't the kind of guy who carry on for dough
The material cat who walk around for show
I'm just your everyday, merry way joe on the go
While others go with the flow
I ain't never been the one to follow trend, I do my own bit
Can't keep up with the Joneses, I'm on my own shit
I don't care what you drink, what you stress
How you dress, or where you got the link; I ain't impressed
These lames run around like mice in a maze
Trying to get up on cheese, it's just a rat race
One of Shaytan's schemes to make man worship things
Over The Supreme Being, or Astafullah
Should I join the hypocrites?
Or side with the suckers by choice It makes no difference
That y'all product of environment, it's just coincidence
The world's a violent place baby, there ain't no more innocence, or civil men or penatence
Just ignorance cats don't know right from wrong
They mimic shit they see on TV or hear in a song
What that tell you they on? A sucker act up every minute
The righteous live on but the the niggas are infinite

[Verse 2: One Be Lo]
I ain't hardcore, I don't pack a 9 millimeter
Most of y'all gangsta rappers ain't hardcore neither
Whoever get mad then I'm talkin' 'bout you
Claim you fear no man but never walk without crew
Where I'm from, your reputation don't mean jack
So what you pack gats and you sell fiend's crack
You ain't big time
My man, you ain't no different from the next cat in my neighborhood who did time
Rhyme after rhyme it's the same topic
What make you think you're hardcore cause you was raised in the projects
Broke ass finally got a hundred in your pocket
Now you on the mic spitting money's no object
What you say is bullcrap
If you wasn't with your crew and wasn't drunk off the brew
Would you still pull gats?
You need to stop frontin'
Or you're headed for self destruction
Yeah, today's topic is self-destruction
I ain't talkin' 'bout the KRS-One discussion
I'm talkin' 'bout the one too many ignorant suckers
Lying on the mic to my sisters and brothers
Every time you listen to the radio, all you hear is nonsense
They never play the bomb shit
Everything that glitters ain't gold
And every gold record don't glitter that's for damn sure

""Y'all need to be cool as shit""
""Time to kick shit from the heart""
""Y'all rambling on, and ain't sayin' nothing""

""When I talk, I know I’m talking for Hip Hoppers all around""

Yo, see cats got confused somewhere man (confused)
About what hip-hop was, you know what I'm sayin'
Or what hip-hop is, (it's business yo) you know it
It's all business
(its big money, know what I'm sayin' that's all these cats about)
You know that's bullshit, right? But dig it though, dig
But if you want to make money yo, I got it broke down though
I got it broke down, (break it down yo)
You got hip-hop, then you got hip-pop
Hip-pop? (hip-pop)
Alright, (but a lot of cats want pop)
Yes, (know what I'm sayin')
It used to be real hip
You got the top 40 version of hip-hop
I still got something else, something else that I wanna get off my chest
What? (know what I'm sayin'?)

[Verse 3: One Be Lo]
How many cats you know speak the illegit rhyme after rhyme diligent?
85 percent represent ignorant
Either you innocent or guilty
Some of my favorite emcees fell off
It damn near killed me
Looking at the kids that was true hip-hop
Nowadays, them cats don't even do hip-hop
Rap got 'em brainwashed with cats that don't last
And five minutes of fame, that's when it's a shame
Seeing real emcees trying to imitate rappers
If you ask me they going out ass backwards
Trading in respect to push a fat Lex
Puff rhyming on the remix, what's next?
It hurts so bad I wanna smack 'em
My favorite crew members break up turn around and join whack ones
This is dedicated to you hip-hop hypocrites
Driving whack songs like you don't give a shit
I ain't got nothing against nobody trying to make a decent living
It ain't the money that's the issue
Only if that's the reason why these cats are making decent music
That's when I got beef with you
And I'ma break it to you like never

I don't know why your feelings are changing but I've seen it in your face
And all those times when our lips were kissing, our tongues were telling lies
And all those signs I've been missing right there in your eyes

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye

I sometimes feel when we're together baby, everything has turned out wrong
And I know you feel exactly the same way but still we carry on
I've been waiting up by the window watching these cars go by
And I tell myself that I'll go through the motions for the last time tonight

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye

Now I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise, I'm watching the light fade away
And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door, and you'll stand here and say

[Directed by Colin Tilley]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, ""Yah!""
Bad trips like, ""Yah!""
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers",Kendrick Lamar,1990,"[82, 65, 43, 29, 20, 7, 6, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 17, 24, 30, 45]",16
255,Dare To Fall In Love,"One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the question of the hour
How can I be sure
Of what I don't know
She comes to me with
A poison in her flower
She steals the miracle of life
Right out of my hand

And she takes the
Part of a woman
Most hard to comprehend
And she multiplies by ten

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the boundary I desire
There is always room enough to feel
Miles and miles of hilly road ahead
And she's got one hand on my heart
And one hand on the wheel

And she moves me one step
Closer to the deeper end
I may never love again

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

One by one
I take the bitter pills
They're hard to swallow
I go round and round, my head
Is spinning out of control

I will know tomorrow
If I care to live or
Face another day of sorrow
Holding onto happy ever after

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love",Brent Bourgeois,1990,"[94, 76, 63, 41, 33, 32, 36, 44, 48, 52, 59, 62, 75]",13
256,Counting The Days,"[Intro]
Wake up, go to work
Come home, it's not working
We've been living our whole lives
On a system that is broken

[Verse 1]
Your words, I hear them
They' re sharp, can't get near them
We've got one lost chance
One more time to make this happen

[Chorus]
We've got one time, time to get this right
2 times and you know it's not my style
3's company, just you and me
We need to figure this one out
4 letter words are all you said
5 minutes later we're in bed
Can't count you to love me but
I can't count the days since you've been gone

[Verse 2]
Wake up, I come home
I realize that it's not working
You're gone, it echoes
I missed the noise of all our fighting
And you know that I don't mean the words I say
And I know that you don't want to to stay away
How long I'm going to be
Counting the days you're gone

[Chorus]
We've got one time, time to get this right
2 times and you know it's not my style
3's company, just you and me
We need to figure this one out
4 letter words are all you said
5 minutes later we're in bed
Can't count you to love me but
I can't count the days since you've been gone

[Bridge]
Ever since I saw you
There was no one else
Just you and me, you were all that I could see
But I got this problem
Don't know how to stay
What I mean, What I mean

[Chorus]
We've got one time, time to get this right
2 times and you know it's not my style
3's company, just you and me
We need to figure this one out
4 letter words are all you said
5 minutes later we're in bed
Can't count you to love me but
I can't count the days since you've been gone

We've got one time, time to get this right
2 times and you know it's not my style

Can't count you to love me but

257,Follow My Heartbeat,"If I live and I die
Does it matter at all
To anyone else in this whole world
If I manage to scale up the highest of walls
To stand or to fall
Would it matter

Something in my soul sends me on
It doesn’t even know how hard the way
Something even the darkest parts can’t scare away

I’ve got to follow my heartbeat wherever
Even if it bleeds
It’s all I know to do
No matter where it leads me to

If I cherish the truth
Abhore the lies
Would the world even care
How I chose it
If I showed my face
Or I wore a disguise
Would the world have the eyes to know it

Something through the cold keeps me warm
Even as the passing storms throw rain
Something’s always there
No matter what it takes

I’ve got to follow my heartbeat wherever
Even if it bleeds
It’s all I know to do
No matter where it leads me to

Just a little dream is all I need
Even if it doesn’t change a thing
Every step I take
Will mean the world to me
And all that I know is

I’ve got to follow my heartbeat wherever
Even if it bleeds
It’s all I know to do
No matter where it leads me to",A’me Lorain,1990,"[100, 74, 72, 73, 77, 92]",6

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back

Niggas couldn't touch the flow if they was playing Twister, right
A minute in it, they turn to Sonny Liston, right
It's plenty of pullin' up, I'm gettin' blisters
Ever since I kissed her
Everyone seem like they got something to say
Like the day after the big day
Is supposed to be super bad like we won't stay
It's supposed to be super scary like we don't pray
We treat the bad advice like bad breath
Either give a compliment or couple mints, depends what we have left
Findin' good news in the bad press
Tell 'em break a leg like an actress, hit with a jab step
1-9 love, that's forever, it'll never stop
1-9 Love, that's a record I'll never drop, uh
1-9 love, that's a one time love
That's a one time, one time, every time it'll be the

They here today, but we'll be together forever

It's been a minute, I've been messin' with ya, I could never switch up
Turn my life around, I'm tryna go to Heaven with ya
I would sit there in the waiting room together with ya
Magazines, pat my jeans, have a beverage with ya
Count my blessings with ya
They prefer success less than when we stress, bet
Forget about all the drama and the comments they left
Out rightly fine, the bottom line is right on top of they text
You gotta remember that the enemy is not of the flesh
You gotta remember that our imagery is made from the best
So pray for the best
Hands high, caught the garter, caught the Hail Mary
Married, tossed the veil, moved to Fort Lauderdale
1-9 to 9-1, that's the goal
9-1 dash, that's the soul
Can't keep track of lies that they told
So extra in the background, that's they role, but
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever

I won't ever slack up, punk, you better back up

If you've got the feeling, jump up, touch the ceiling
Muggs lets the funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes

If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle, bring your shotgun (Shotgun)
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill
I came to get down, I came to get down

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
It up, up and around, then buck, buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya

At a time, when love was real, and you were mine
I start missing all the times we spent
The words we'd say, how I never dreamt
I'd get this way when I dream of you

Oh and I've been seeing, the same visions night after night

A hundred times I have you back
Im yours whenever you want me;
I wanna shout about it, tell the world about it

268,Coming Of Age,"[Bridge]
Through all the good things, and all the hardships
And all the times that we thought that we lost it
We hold our heads high and keep our chins up
'Cause when we die, well, at least we did something
We went for broke when we found a cause
We took the path that they said was wrong
So when that song plays, you know where you where
The day we live for, the day the truth worked
Work, work, yeah, the truth works
At the very same time, yeah, the truth hurts
Been taught our whole lives just to shoot first
I'ma keep living 'till they put me in that new hearse

Keep on moving, steady screaming out ""EH!""
And we only get one, so damn it we gon' play!
Too big to fail, they bail, we gon' stay
Put our time in hard, we all coming of age

[Verse 1]
They've been speaking from the roof top. I've been on the ground floor
With my fucking boom box. Trying to play it loud for 'em
They don't wanna hear that, but they'll play anything
Call me John Cusack. I will say anything
To keep the truth mixed in I will be the sixth man
Living in a different world. Look at this wingspan
Fuck it I can fly high. Pockets still way low
So I don't play games. Never seen a Halo
I ain't trying to hate though. Got my own vices
Help me get through, but they still love crisis
So we do the give and take. Looking for the give and go
I be setting screens so mean Doc Rivers called
But I'm on a different grind, and time has never been abundant

Negative as fuck, but your heart's in the right place
Paying life's toll so appreciate the chump change

Hey baby girl, go on grab your luggage now
We're going to trip 'till we shut the fucking struggle down
Tired of getting choked up at every sad song
So we're going to do it right and never write a bad song
They ain't listening. No they ain't listening
We're on the balance beam sipping on the bitterness
Perfect harmony, finger to the dissonance
No timeouts, we win, no Michigan
Metronome click click click till we split split split
In between trying to find that niche
Fabricate feelings when you need that fix
When you're human it'll hurt. If it doesn't, you're a prick

There goes my old girlfriend, there's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises? I guess they don't mean a thing
So baby, what's the story? Did you find another man
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire, but now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner, yeah, my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money, then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night

272,The Heart Of The Matter,"[Verse 1]
I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And all the struggles we went through
How I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

[Chorus]
I've been learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning them again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

[Verse 2]
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
And the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
Are the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the wall they put between us
You know it doesn't keep us warm

[Chorus]
I've been trying to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
And all the things I thought I'd figured out, I have to learn again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my heart is so shattered
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

[Bridge]
Ooh, there are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down, you know they hurt your pride
Gotta put it all behind you; cause life goes on
You can't carry that anger, it'll eat you up inside
I want a happily ever after
And my heart is so shattered
But I know it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

[Chorus]
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh gets weak
And the ashes will scatter

'Cause the last time left me cold
When she left my house, she didn’t even let me know

Part of the reason I’m easily hurt
Part of the reason I’m leaving you first
Pardon that, part of me give my apologies
I know that working on it never works
I’m sorry it’s you, but hey what should I do?
Be happy with lies? Or be sad with the truth?
Don’t be ashamed you see love is a game and I still want to play

Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind

I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow.""
I fall behind

And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay

We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world
We party all around the world

[Verse 1: Mac miller]
I got my cup filled, bitches all around me on some bachelor shit
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it
Globe trotter, ho hopper, superstar asterik
People always wonder so they ask us who we are
Rolling up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar
Wanna be on top and tryna to get there by tomorrow
See the money, bitches, bubbly, designer clothes, foreign cars
But I ain’t never gonna change
Different city everyday
You hear these people scream my name
They think I’m underage
They don’t know shit about the game
Till I’m drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne
Living life like it’s my job, and I don’t ever take a day off
Shit ain’t been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some “I don’t give a fuck” shit
Still with my homies I came up with so celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous

Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bitches of every nationality get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin’ noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch you can’t breathe
Somewhere where it’s sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do never made a plan B
Can’t we, get it how we live
Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls, comin’ all dressed up and they takin’ off their clothes
We know your man an ameteur so come party with some pros
You need something new, I know your life is gettin’ old
We ain’t gettin’ younger so tonight's the night to go
So, crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like you cash right
It’s the fast life, don’t worry baby we ain’t here to slow it down
Tonight we goin’ crazy and tomorra’ you can hold me down

Overlook me, underrate me
Probably hate me
Really you should thank me
Get up every time I fall on my face
Like I was plankin’
Tell me what they thinkin’
Don’t want the accolade
This is the 6LACK parade
Smart people follow after me
Is that why y’all attackin’ me?
I want the love child
I am the love child
Do you want the love child?
Here comes the love child
It’s crazy ‘cause even when they aim with hate
I deflect it and aim away
Had the chance to change ya fate
But I change my ways
You know, you niggas can’t relate
So I wanna know
Where is the love child?
White man said I’d never be loved, child
That I was here to go to jail and be a thug child
Run a, run a hood ’til I catch a slug child

[Verse 2: Mereba]
She was from the motherfuckin’ corner
Ain’t she sweet magnolia
Niggas pack heat like furnaces
The bitch got flipped like pancakes
Bitches hate on ya when ya menstruate
She want posta’
‘member what she composed of
She is the love child
Was she the love child?
No you’re the love child
For sure you the love child
We came up from the dirt
The depths of the Earth
The blessed and the cursed
Where less is the mores
Where niggas the most
We lost what we most
So self remorsed
And I am a love child
So you ain’t finna see no fear in my eyes
Sent from above child
‘Cause we never feel no fear in this side
Peaceful but still keep a piece
I pray when I’m hoping to see
I know that it glows around me
I’m not what they hoped I would be

[Verse 3: J.I.D]
Eat, pray, slay, say, show, go give love everyday
Make your way, make wave
Love child, love hurts, love pain
Love fiend, love slave, love me and you gay
Lovingly the normal way
Smack my face and walk away, damn
Uh, I thought this was love child
Playing little games acting like a little child
We break up and you saying I’m a scrub now
Wow damn, pow scram, loud downstairs
And it’s looking like y’all want the bear
I’m hoping there’s more dope in here than you showed me
I’m hoping you don’t show me
But meanwhile, right now I could be
I could be your love child

[Verse 4: Jordxn Bryant]
It always feel right when it go right through
You the only one I get a whole night to
You could see the passion in the way I move
Same shit different clearance, deja vu
From the Earth with a curse with the seance crew
I flow through the sky with a radar too
Got will too strong to let J.R. shoot
I’ve been living in the middle with the chaos too
Blunts power, gun powder, run miles just to get away to the moon
Sun’s power, lungs dying just to inflate from the doom, gravitate to you
Nightmares to dreams, whispers to screams, dark nights I’ve seen brighten some things
By any means, God bless the Queen, God bless the King, the love child is me

[Verse 5: Johnny Venus]
A tip from the child
A drift from you now
Come plummet on down
Slowly coat my tongue
To where you run from
Can’t escape the shadows
Afraid to become
Afraid to be loved
How could I be loved?
Why should I be loved?
My mouth always full with my foot with my love
‘Cause I ain’t ever really satisfied
And I don’t really want but everything
Put out could see the side of mine
And that’s a recipe for my demise
‘Cause I never had a missing piece
Swear I never ever really need a thing
But that is the love child
Showers the tears
To baptize my peers
Now bring me the mud child
No can’t stop the rain
No can’t stop the pain this sent from above
You’ve got to have love
You’ve got to have love child
But lust is the flood
The trust is the words swept under the rug
Until we are loved
Until we all learn","EARTHGANG, J.I.D, 6LACK, Mereba & Jordxn Bryant",1990,"[85, 73, 45, 25, 14, 13, 15, 15, 18, 21, 21, 31, 38, 50, 69]",15

And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to The Vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound
I took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiners Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave, I work my fingers to the bone

So I could own my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there, but where? God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me

So if you see my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I've still got my hands on the wheel

Yay-o
Yay-o
Yay-o
Yay-yay-o

Now I drive my Downeaster ""Alexa""
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in swordfishing here
I was a bayman like my father was before
You can't make a living as a bayman anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for Islanders like me

Look, now, I can't promise commitment, but I swear we'll have fun
If you, ask I'll be honest, girl, you not the only one
Just a man on a mission, with my hand on my gun
Couple niggas that hate me, but way more people show love
Niggas tryin' too hard, they dyin' to ball
Then turn around and hate on me like it's a crime to evolve
Too afraid to be different, too ashamed to just listen
See I'm way too 100, so now they hate on my niggas
Tried to hate on my Crippin', tried to hate on my business
Not to call you a bitch, but they gon' hate on my bitches
So if you fucking with Nip, let you know my intentions
Got to think like a rider, you gotta know your position
So if it's cool, then we can hop in my Mercedes coupe
Pop the cork off this imperial Veuv'
Crank the music, blowin' circles out the roof
And just enjoy the view

Yeah, young nigga, started off with a vision
Built this shit up from nothing, to the critics I ain't listen
Now, transition, so check out how I'm livin'
We V12 pushers and they transmissions is slippin'
Nigga, get yo' bitch, 'cause I be bitch-gettin'
Treat her like she wanna be treated, but I ain't trickin'
Beat it like she want her shit beated, but I don't kiss it
Just blame it on that shit that we smokin', plus we sippin'

289,All That Glitters Isn't Gold,"[Verse 1:]
Yesterday, I met a boy so fine
Right away I knew
He'd captivate my mind

So strong
The kind you dream about
Baby, together
We could really turn it out

I showed him to
Some friends of mine
They said, girl
Don't waste your time

That boy's no good for you
Listen, girl
I'm telling you
I think it's time you knew that

[Chorus:]
All that glitters isn't gold
Everything you see isn't what it seems to be
(No, oh, oh)
Oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes we make the mistake
Of thinking everything
That looks good is great

We all seem to go for what shines
And then we leave all of
The other things behind

Some people always give a show
Cause it's the only way they know
But you don't have to play that game
Because the only thing that matters
Is what's inside your heart

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
So here's my advice to you
Everything you see's
Not always true

Take the time to look inside
And find out for yourself
What's really on their minds

[Repeat Chorus:]

No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold...

Oh, no, it isn't gold
No, no, it isn't gold
Everything you see's
Not what it seems to be

Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no

294,Just A Friend,"[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south

I thought I gave up falling in love

You shouldn't really know
And it's been true all my life

I've been talking to myself
Just to suggest that I'm selfish

298,Shake,"[JACQUES]
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

303,Pictures Of You,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are
All I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

[Verse 3]
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 4]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart

304,Heaven Is A 4 Letter Word,"There's a rumor here
And it's going round
Can you hear it on the street
If you realize that the pleasure lies
Between surrender and the heat

Just take a walk
On the wild side babe
And I'll meet you halfway there
And if you're talking about paradise
There's no need to say a prayer
Cause baby I'll take you there

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word

Lose your innocence
For experience
But you've got to take the chance
Can you rock and roll
Can you get down babe
Cause it's tough for you to dance

Don't need to ride in a limousine
To feel like a millionaire
And if you're talking 'bout fantasy
It could happen anywhere
Baby I'll take you there

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word

It's like love and kiss
And it feels like this
Baby don't wait too long
It's just me and you
We know what to do
And it's a long way til dawn

That I am ready to go, heartbeat

I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 1]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
'Cause

[Verse 2]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go 100
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
69 is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke
And light

So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money, then you burn me, then you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?

307,Nick Of Time,"[Intro: Jeremy lin]
The biggest thing is to understand that your talent, your ability to play basketball is a gift from God
I think the biggest thing is to understand that you have to use that for God's glory

[Hook: Jin]
Yeah I been on my grind
Reachin' for the top and you've been on mind
They stready tryin' to stop my shine
But it's always been yours it's never been mine
You always come thru just in the nick of time
You come thru in the nick of time
You come thru in the nick of time
So I give it up to you everytime I shine

[Verse: Jin]
See this if life to me to you it's entertainment
It's quite intricate and only I can explain it
To say I've come a long way would be an understatement
The moment of truth every single one is savored
Chasing greatness not the pressure that it came with
Far from picture perfect observe as I paint it
Dealing with the games highs and lows
You win some you lose some yeah I suppose
But when the sweet smell of victory is by my nose
I see what's goin' on even when my eyes are closed
Guarantee you're not stoppin' me or blockin' me
All I need is one shot promised you'll be shocked to see
The outcome I don't just play to win
Everytime I lace up yeah I play for him
Doin' my all to make sure that your glory is known
While they fighting for the title see the king on his throne

[Hook: Jin]
Yeah I been on my grind
Reachin' for the top and you've been on mind
They stready tryin' to stop my shine
But it's always been yours it's never been mine
You always come thru just in the nick of time
You come thru in the nick of time
You come thru in the nick of time
So I give it up to you everytime I shine

[Verse 2: Jin]
Yes I'm really here to serve you not just pretend to
With each setback I intend to
Learn from experience and get better with time
No matter what I achieve none of the credit is mine
In the grand scheme of things you're the head of design
And in any circumstance you said I'll be fine
The ultimate play maker I follow your lead
Never find need to feed into these naysayers
Who repeatedly told me that I would never make
You're probably testing me to see if I could take it
The bond between us they could never break it
All that you have given me I shall not forsake it
Your grace patience and all of your love
Which one don't I deserve it's all the above
Where amazing happens I love this game
Only one reason I'm playing and god is his name

[Hook: Jin]
Yeah I been on my grind
Reachin' for the top and you've been on mind
They stready tryin' to stop my shine
But it's always been yours it's never been mine
You always come thru just in the nick of time
You come thru in the nick of time
You come thru in the nick of time
So I give it up to you everytime I shine

[Outro: Jeremy Lin]
I think also something that I needed to learn was just because you pray and just because you give it up to god doesn't mean that you're gonna win, and doesn't mean that you're necessarily gonna have a great performance and all that, but I think there's something special about playing the right way and having the right attitude even if you don't necessarily win or have a successful career",MC Jin,1990,"[93, 92, 94]",3

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save

We fight, we get high holdin' on to love
We came down 'cause there was nothing holdin' us
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?

So, darlin'

319,Oye Mi Canto (Hear My Voice),"Take me only for what I am
You've got a right to speak your mind
You've gotta take a stand

No one has the right to say
This is right or that is wrong
It isn't just one way

Find common ground
Go in between
Things aren't always what they seem

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

People, let's give each other room
If we're gonna work it out
We better make it soon

Love is, love is such a common word
When it's pride we mistake for love
Isn't that absurd

Why always take the upper hand
It's better to understand

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

I believe in love but with no conditions
Oye mi canto
And giving in sometimes doesn't make it submission
Oye mi canto
Hate is so common It's almost tradition
Oye mi canto
Come on let's leave it behind and make that transition
Oye mi canto

Oye mi canto, oye mi canto
Oye mi canto, oye mi canto

Oye, oye, oye mi canto

320,Cuts You Up,"I find you in the morning
After dreams of distant signs
You pour yourself over me
Like the sun through the blinds
You lift me up and get me out
Keep me walking but never shout
Hold the secret close, I hear you say
(Here we go)

You know the way, it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out
It spits you out when you desire
To conquer it, to feel you're higher
To follow it you must be clean
With mistakes that you do mean
Move the heart and switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

On and on it goes
Calling like a distant wind
Oh, through the zero hour we'll walk
We'll cut the thick and break the thin
No sound to break, no moment clear
When all the doubts are crystal clear
Crashing hard into the secret wind

You know the way, it twists and turns
Changing colour, spinning yarns
You know the way, it leaves you dry
It cuts you up and takes you high
You know the way, it's painted gold
Is it honey? Is it cold?

Look for what seems out of place

(Oh...) Cuts you up

The line it twists, it twists away
Cuts you up and spits you out
Keeps you walking but never shout

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste

Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I've got nothing to hide
On and on, I've got nothing to hide

Que a sorte não veio
Mas tu tens o amor
Aquece, então molha esse corpo

Quem não diz verdades nem ao coração

De que lado o dia é paz?
Fiz as pazes com meus pais
Quem me dera ser o que é melhor em mim
Nada fica no mesmo lugar
Tudo muda sem querer parar
Quem me dera ser o meu melhor em ti

[Verso 2: Froid]
Meu peito faz tum-tum quando eu te vejo, baby
Digita no Google um filme bom e põe na TV
Eu nem achei ruim porque só fui até o trailer
Eu te fiz suar mais do que o personal trainer
E baby, no bumbum pra crescer é só o shake
Então vem com tudo que hoje eu tô com um macete
Eu seguro a cintura, você segura a parede
É quase cirúrgico, amor, fala pra elas
Eu só sinto sua pulsação quando ela acelera
Nesse corpo tem uma alma que não para quieta
Eu vi a tara que ela tava, eu vi na cara dela
Ela molhada e eu navegava com a minha caravela
Ela pelada, mano, carambola é uma parcela
Eu marco os números da sorte na minha cartela
Quase que a base da minha asa delta
Ela é médica, nunca dá alta, eu tô de cama bem na casa dela

Complex, putting out a hex, getting a vex
Make me wonna set some traps and nets

All suspicions are groundless without foundation

326,"How 'Bout Us (From ""True Love"")","There's some things on my mind
I don't know that I should be thinkin'
Am I wastin' my time thinkin' 'bout
You and I, and these feelings
'cause I see you and me holdin' hands
Doin' things, goin' further
But they say we're too young
And those things will come
I'm just curious

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a girl
Comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us

Thinkin' 'bout you and me
Thinkin' 'bout how it feels
I'm curious
I just wanna know what
True love is, though
I'm just feelin' us

On the phone in my bed
On my back, starin' at the ceiling
When I'm talkin' to you
What I feel, is it true?
I'm wondering
Well I tell it, and I
What I feel deep inside
It keeps burning
Does my man understand
Everything that I am
I'm just curious
I'm just curious

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a girl
Comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us

If I could have things my way
We'd go pass time
Maybe we'd do the things
I'm thinkin' in my mind
And all the things I want to know, I'd know
The places we'd explore, I'd go
But now I see us both together
Learnin' more about each other

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a girl
Comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a girl
Comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us

You know boy
We both know that we have a thing for each other
And it's natural for us to both wonder
What it would be like
But the time is not right
And I hope you're satisfied
Because I'm satisfied
Just bein' curious

I can't get you off my mind

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a girl

Before you walk away

It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'
Sayin' things I never thought I'd say
Can't you hear me knocking
Tried to fool you but it wouldn't play
Cuz my heart it's talkin', it's talkin'
Baby, it's talkin'
Talkin' to you

Everytime I take it to the edge
Everytime I'm so afraid
Don't you know I cry my eyes out, babe
Everytime you look away
Oh, I almost dropped a tear
But I caught it just in time
I'd say those things you want to hear
If you'd help me, help me, help me try

It's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'
Yeah, it's only, only, only, only my heart talkin'
Sayin' things I never thought I'd say
Can't you hear me knocking

Sometimes I need to hear you voice
Sometimes I don't want to know

You're takin' just what you need
And then you're well on your way
(I hear the same old story almost every day)

[Bridge]
It's a shame that you won't see me when I need you tonight
Cause I know that if you did then everything would be right
And I've tried my very best to give the things that you need
But the blues they seem to follow me I never succeed

[Guitar Solo]

I wanna take you in my arms and you just don't wanna know

Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, ""I know you need a break.""
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like the Carter, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard

I can't erase the stupid things I say
You're better than me
I struggle just to find a better way

[Chorus]
So here we are, fighting and trying to hide the scars
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye
The lonely road, the one that I should try to walk alone
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye

[Verse 2]
You wouldn't like me
Keep moving on until forever ends
Don't try to fight me
The beauty queen has lost her crown again

[Chorus]
So here we are, fighting and trying to hide the scars
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye
The lonely road, the one that I should try to walk alone
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye

[Bridge]
So why are you so eager to betray?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up
So why are you the one that walks away?
Pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up, pick the pieces up

[Chorus]
So here we are, fighting and trying to hide the scars
I'll be home tonight, take a breath and softly say goodbye

335,Roam,"[Verse 1]
Give up and go home
Alone, and suffer some more
This head of stone lets no one in anymore
Cause my effort is never enough
I'll start unpacking all of my stuff
Cause I've come to know my place
So let's wreck everything I've built except the base

[Chorus]
You have no idea how unproductive it is
To fall in and out of you as often as I do
And lately I've been feeling grey but today
I'm alright no thanks to you

[Verse 2]
Think I'll go and roam outside your boundary
Walk on the ridge. Far away from the city
Friends of friends prove untrustworthy
Be gone, just like you were at the last party
No SOS until the bottles are empty

[Bridge]
Now my hunger isn't wasted anymore
Cause I'm younger but I'm tired and I'm sore
I know where you've been
You’re ruining men
Never again will I let someone in
I know where you've been
You’re ruining men
Never again will I let someone in

[Chorus]
You have no idea how unproductive it is
To fall in and out of you as often as I do
And lately I've been feeling grey but today

Since way back then
And only if you knew how much I loved you
You'd turn to me and say.....

Let's just say that our love is right
Would you kiss and hold me tight
Cos I want to hold you and squeeze you
And tell you that I love you
Each and every night
Let's just say that our love is strong
Would you know were you belong
Or would I have to show you and teach you
Hold you and please you to show you that you belong

339,"Wild Women Do (From ""Pretty Woman"")","VASHTI

To wonder sadly, did I say? No: a new influence began to act upon my life, and sadness, for a certain space, was held at bay. Conceive a dell, deep-hollowed in forest secresy; it lies in dimness and mist: its turf is dank, its herbage pale and humid. A storm or an axe makes a wide gap amongst the oak-trees; the breeze sweeps in; the sun looks down; the sad, cold dell becomes a deep cup of lustre; high summer pours her blue glory and her golden light out of that beauteous sky, which till now the starved hollow never saw.

A new creed became mine—a belief in happiness.

It was three weeks since the adventure of the garret, and I possessed in that case, box, drawer up-stairs, casketed with that first letter, four companions like to it, traced by the same firm pen, sealed with the same clear seal, full of the same vital comfort. Vital comfort it seemed to me then: I read them in after years; they were kind letters enough—pleasing letters, because composed by one well pleased; in the two last there were three or four closing lines half-gay, half-tender, ""by feeling touched, but not subdued."" Time, dear reader, mellowed them to a beverage of this mild quality; but when I first tasted their elixir, fresh from the fount so honoured, it seemed juice of a divine vintage: a draught which Hebe might fill, and the very gods approve.

Does the reader, remembering what was said some pages back, care to ask how I answered these letters: whether under the dry, stinting check of Reason, or according to the full, liberal impulse of Feeling?

To speak truth, I compromised matters; I served two masters: I bowed down in the houses of Rimmon, and lifted the heart at another shrine. I wrote to these letters two answers—one for my own relief, the other for Graham's perusal.

To begin with: Feeling and I turned Reason out of doors, drew against her bar and bolt, then we sat down, spread our paper, dipped in the ink an eager pen, and, with deep enjoyment, poured out our sincere heart. When we had done—when two sheets were covered with the language of a strongly-adherent affection, a rooted and active gratitude—(once, for all, in this parenthesis, I disclaim, with the utmost scorn, every sneaking suspicion of what are called ""warmer feelings:"" women do not entertain these ""warmer feelings"" where, from the commencement, through the whole progress of an acquaintance, they have never once been cheated of the conviction that, to do so would be to commit a mortal absurdity: nobody ever launches into Love unless he has seen or dreamed the rising of Hope's star over Love's troubled waters)—when, then, I had given expression to a closely-clinging and deeply-honouring attachment—an attachment that wanted to attract to itself and take to its own lot all that was painful in the destiny of its object; that would, if it could, have absorbed and conducted away all storms and lightnings from an existence viewed with a passion of solicitude—then, just at that moment, the doors of my heart would shake, bolt and bar would yield, Reason would leap in vigorous and revengeful, snatch the full sheets, read, sneer, erase, tear up, re-write, fold, seal, direct, and send a terse, curt missive of a page. She did right.

I did not live on letters only: I was visited, I was looked after; once a week I was taken out to La Terrasse; always I was made much of. Dr. Bretton failed not to tell me why he was so kind: ""To keep away the nun,"" he said; ""he was determined to dispute with her her prey. He had taken,"" he declared, ""a thorough dislike to her, chiefly on account of that white face-cloth, and those cold grey eyes: the moment he heard of those odious particulars,"" he affirmed, ""consummate disgust had incited him to oppose her; he was determined to try whether he or she was the cleverest, and he only wished she would once more look in upon me when he was present:"" but that she never did. In short, he regarded me scientifically in the light of a patient, and at once exercised his professional skill, and gratified his natural benevolence, by a course of cordial and attentive treatment.

One evening, the first in December, I was walking by myself in the carré; it was six o'clock; the classe-doors were closed; but within, the pupils, rampant in the licence of evening recreation, were counterfeiting a miniature chaos. The carré was quite dark, except a red light shining under and about the stove; the wide glass-doors and the long windows were frosted over; a crystal sparkle of starlight, here and there spangling this blanched winter veil, and breaking with scattered brilliance the paleness of its embroidery, proved it a clear night, though moonless. That I should dare to remain thus alone in darkness, showed that my nerves were regaining a healthy tone: I thought of the nun, but hardly feared her; though the staircase was behind me, leading up, through blind, black night, from landing to landing, to the haunted grenier. Yet I own my heart quaked, my pulse leaped, when I suddenly heard breathing and rustling, and turning, saw in the deep shadow of the steps a deeper shadow still—a shape that moved and descended. It paused a while at the classe-door, and then it glided before me. Simultaneously came a clangor of the distant door-bell. Life-like sounds bring life-like feelings: this shape was too round and low for my gaunt nun: it was only Madame Beck on duty.

""Mademoiselle Lucy!"" cried Rosine, bursting in, lamp in hand, from the corridor, ""on est là pour vous au salon.""

Madame saw me, I saw Madame, Rosine saw us both: there was no mutual recognition. I made straight for the salon. There I found what I own I anticipated I should find—Dr. Bretton; but he was in evening-dress.

""The carriage is at the door,"" said he; ""my mother has sent it to take you to the theatre; she was going herself, but an arrival has prevented her: she immediately said, 'Take Lucy in my place.' Will you go?""

""Just now? I am not dressed,"" cried I, glancing despairingly at my dark merino.

""You have half an hour to dress. I should have given you notice, but I only determined on going since five o'clock, when I heard there was to be a genuine regale in the presence of a great actress.""

And he mentioned a name that thrilled me—a name that, in those days, could thrill Europe. It is hushed now: its once restless echoes are all still; she who bore it went years ago to her rest: night and oblivion long since closed above her; but then her day—a day of Sirius—stood at its full height, light and fervour.

""I'll go; I will be ready in ten minutes,"" I vowed. And away I flew, never once checked, reader, by the thought which perhaps at this moment checks you: namely, that to go anywhere with Graham and without Mrs. Bretton could be objectionable. I could not have conceived, much less have expressed to Graham, such thought—such scruple—without risk of exciting a tyrannous self-contempt: of kindling an inward fire of shame so quenchless, and so devouring, that I think it would soon have licked up the very life in my veins. Besides, my godmother, knowing her son, and knowing me, would as soon have thought of chaperoning a sister with a brother, as of keeping anxious guard over our incomings and outgoings.

The present was no occasion for showy array; my dun mist crape would suffice, and I sought the same in the great oak-wardrobe in the dormitory, where hung no less than forty dresses. But there had been changes and reforms, and some innovating hand had pruned this same crowded wardrobe, and carried divers garments to the grenier—my crape amongst the rest. I must fetch it. I got the key, and went aloft fearless, almost thoughtless. I unlocked the door, I plunged in. The reader may believe it or not, but when I thus suddenly entered, that garret was not wholly dark as it should have been: from one point there shone a solemn light, like a star, but broader. So plainly it shone, that it revealed the deep alcove with a portion of the tarnished scarlet curtain drawn over it. Instantly, silently, before my eyes, it vanished; so did the curtain and alcove: all that end of the garret became black as night. I ventured no research; I had not time nor will; snatching my dress, which hung on the wall, happily near the door, I rushed out, relocked the door with convulsed haste, and darted downwards to the dormitory.

But I trembled too much to dress myself: impossible to arrange hair or fasten hooks-and-eyes with such fingers, so I called Rosine and bribed her to help me. Rosine liked a bribe, so she did her best, smoothed and plaited my hair as well as a coiffeur would have done, placed the lace collar mathematically straight, tied the neck-ribbon accurately—in short, did her work like the neat-handed Phillis she could be when she those. Having given me my handkerchief and gloves, she took the candle and lighted me down-stairs. After all, I had forgotten my shawl; she ran back to fetch it; and I stood with Dr. John in the vestibule, waiting.

""What is this, Lucy?"" said he, looking down at me narrowly. ""Here is the old excitement. Ha! the nun again?""

But I utterly denied the charge: I was vexed to be suspected of a second illusion. He was sceptical.

""She has been, as sure as I live,"" said he; ""her figure crossing your eyes leaves on them a peculiar gleam and expression not to be mistaken.""

""She has not been,"" I persisted: for, indeed, I could deny her apparition with truth.

""The old symptoms are there,"" he affirmed: ""a particular pale, and what the Scotch call a 'raised' look.""

He was so obstinate, I thought it better to tell him what I really had seen. Of course with him it was held to be another effect of the same cause: it was all optical illusion—nervous malady, and so on. Not one bit did I believe him; but I dared not contradict: doctors are so self-opinionated, so immovable in their dry, materialist views.

Rosine brought the shawl, and I was bundled into the carriage.

                                * * * * *

The theatre was full—crammed to its roof: royal and noble were there: palace and hotel had emptied their inmates into those tiers so thronged and so hushed. Deeply did I feel myself privileged in having a place before that stage; I longed to see a being of whose powers I had heard reports which made me conceive peculiar anticipations. I wondered if she would justify her renown: with strange curiosity, with feelings severe and austere, yet of riveted interest, I waited. She was a study of such nature as had not encountered my eyes yet: a great and new planet she was: but in what shape? I waited her rising.

She rose at nine that December night: above the horizon I saw her come. She could shine yet with pale grandeur and steady might; but that star verged already on its judgment-day. Seen near, it was a chaos—hollow, half-consumed: an orb perished or perishing—half lava, half glow.

I had heard this woman termed ""plain,"" and I expected bony harshness and grimness—something large, angular, sallow. What I saw was the shadow of a royal Vashti: a queen, fair as the day once, turned pale now like twilight, and wasted like wax in flame.

For awhile—a long while—I thought it was only a woman, though an unique woman, Who moved in might and grace before this multitude. By-and-by I recognised my mistake. Behold! I found upon her something neither of woman nor of man: in each of her eyes sat a devil. These evil forces bore her through the tragedy, kept up her feeble strength—for she was but a frail creature; and as the action rose and the stir deepened, how wildly they shook her with their passions of the pit! They wrote HELL on her straight, haughty brow. They tuned her voice to the note of torment. They writhed her regal face to a demoniac mask. Hate and Murder and Madness incarnate she stood.

It was a marvellous sight: a mighty revelation.

It was a spectacle low, horrible, immoral.

Swordsmen thrust through, and dying in their blood on the arena sand; bulls goring horses disembowelled, made a meeker vision for the public—a milder condiment for a people's palate—than Vashti torn by seven devils: devils which cried sore and rent the tenement they haunted, but still refused to be exorcised.

Suffering had struck that stage empress; and she stood before her audience neither yielding to, nor enduring, nor, in finite measure, resenting it: she stood locked in struggle, rigid in resistance. She stood, not dressed, but draped in pale antique folds, long and regular like sculpture. A background and entourage and flooring of deepest crimson threw her out, white like alabaster—like silver: rather, be it said, like Death.

Where was the artist of the Cleopatra? Let him come and sit down and study this different vision. Let him seek here the mighty brawn, the muscle, the abounding blood, the full-fed flesh he worshipped: let all materialists draw nigh and look on.

I have said that she does not resent her grief. No; the weakness of that word would make it a lie. To her, what hurts becomes immediately embodied: she looks on it as a thing that can be attacked, worried down, torn in shreds. Scarcely a substance herself, she grapples to conflict with abstractions. Before calamity she is a tigress; she rends her woes, shivers them in convulsed abhorrence. Pain, for her, has no result in good: tears water no harvest of wisdom: on sickness, on death itself, she looks with the eye of a rebel. Wicked, perhaps, she is, but also she is strong; and her strength has conquered Beauty, has overcome Grace, and bound both at her side, captives peerlessly fair, and docile as fair. Even in the uttermost frenzy of energy is each maenad movement royally, imperially, incedingly upborne. Her hair, flying loose in revel or war, is still an angel's hair, and glorious under a halo. Fallen, insurgent, banished, she remembers the heaven where she rebelled. Heaven's light, following her exile, pierces its confines, and discloses their forlorn remoteness.

Place now the Cleopatra, or any other slug, before her as an obstacle, and see her cut through the pulpy mass as the scimitar of Saladin clove the down cushion. Let Paul Peter Rubens wake from the dead, let him rise out of his cerements, and bring into this presence all the army of his fat women; the magian power or prophet-virtue gifting that slight rod of Moses, could, at one waft, release and re-mingle a sea spell-parted, whelming the heavy host with the down-rush of overthrown sea-ramparts.

Vashti was not good, I was told; and I have said she did not look good: though a spirit, she was a spirit out of Tophet. Well, if so much of unholy force can arise from below, may not an equal efflux of sacred essence descend one day from above?

What thought Dr. Graham of this being?

For long intervals I forgot to look how he demeaned himself, or to question what he thought. The strong magnetism of genius drew my heart out of its wonted orbit; the sunflower turned from the south to a fierce light, not solar—a rushing, red, cometary light—hot on vision and to sensation. I had seen acting before, but never anything like this: never anything which astonished Hope and hushed Desire; which outstripped Impulse and paled Conception; which, instead of merely irritating imagination with the thought of what might be done, at the same time fevering the nerves because it was not done, disclosed power like a deep, swollen winter river, thundering in cataract, and bearing the soul, like a leaf, on the steep and steelly sweep of its descent.

Miss Fanshawe, with her usual ripeness of judgment, pronounced Dr. Bretton a serious, impassioned man, too grave and too impressible. Not in such light did I ever see him: no such faults could I lay to his charge. His natural attitude was not the meditative, nor his natural mood the sentimental; impressionable he was as dimpling water, but, almost as water, unimpressible: the breeze, the sun, moved him—metal could not grave, nor fire brand.

Dr. John could think and think well, but he was rather a man of action than of thought; he could feel, and feel vividly in his way, but his heart had no chord for enthusiasm: to bright, soft, sweet influences his eyes and lips gave bright, soft, sweet welcome, beautiful to see as dyes of rose and silver, pearl and purple, imbuing summer clouds; for what belonged to storm, what was wild and intense, dangerous, sudden, and flaming, he had no sympathy, and held with it no communion. When I took time and regained inclination to glance at him, it amused and enlightened me to discover that he was watching that sinister and sovereign Vashti, not with wonder, nor worship, nor yet dismay, but simply with intense curiosity. Her agony did not pain him, her wild moan—worse than a shriek—did not much move him; her fury revolted him somewhat, but not to the point of horror. Cool young Briton! The pale cliffs of his own England do not look down on the tides of the Channel more calmly than he watched the Pythian inspiration of that night.

Looking at his face, I longed to know his exact opinions, and at last I put a question tending to elicit them. At the sound of my voice he awoke as if out of a dream; for he had been thinking, and very intently thinking, his own thoughts, after his own manner. ""How did he like Vashti?"" I wished to know.

""Hm-m-m,"" was the first scarce articulate but expressive answer; and then such a strange smile went wandering round his lips, a smile so critical, so almost callous! I suppose that for natures of that order his sympathies were callous. In a few terse phrases he told me his opinion of, and feeling towards, the actress: he judged her as a woman, not an artist: it was a branding judgment.

That night was already marked in my book of life, not with white, but with a deep-red cross. But I had not done with it yet; and other memoranda were destined to be set down in characters of tint indelible.

Towards midnight, when the deepening tragedy blackened to the death-scene, and all held their breath, and even Graham bit his under-lip, and knit his brow, and sat still and struck—when the whole theatre was hushed, when the vision of all eyes centred in one point, when all ears listened towards one quarter—nothing being seen but the white form sunk on a seat, quivering in conflict with her last, her worst-hated, her visibly-conquering foe—nothing heard but her throes, her gaspings, breathing yet of mutiny, panting still defiance; when, as it seemed, an inordinate will, convulsing a perishing mortal frame, bent it to battle with doom and death, fought every inch of ground, sold every drop of blood, resisted to the latest the rape of every faculty, would see, would hear, would breathe, would live, up to, within, well-nigh beyond the moment when death says to all sense and all being—""Thus far and no farther!""—

Just then a stir, pregnant with omen, rustled behind the scenes—feet ran, voices spoke. What was it? demanded the whole house. A flame, a smell of smoke replied.

""Fire!"" rang through the gallery. ""Fire!"" was repeated, re-echoed, yelled forth: and then, and faster than pen can set it down, came panic, rushing, crushing—a blind, selfish, cruel chaos.

And Dr. John? Reader, I see him yet, with his look of comely courage and cordial calm.

""Lucy will sit still, I know,"" said he, glancing down at me with the same serene goodness, the same repose of firmness that I have seen in him when sitting at his side amid the secure peace of his mother's hearth. Yes, thus adjured, I think I would have sat still under a rocking crag: but, indeed, to sit still in actual circumstances was my instinct; and at the price of my very life, I would not have moved to give him trouble, thwart his will, or make demands on his attention. We were in the stalls, and for a few minutes there was a most terrible, ruthless pressure about us.

""How terrified are the women!"" said he; ""but if the men were not almost equally so, order might be maintained. This is a sorry scene: I see fifty selfish brutes at this moment, each of whom, if I were near, I could conscientiously knock down. I see some women braver than some men. There is one yonder—Good God!""

While Graham was speaking, a young girl who had been very quietly and steadily clinging to a gentleman before us, was suddenly struck from her protector's arms by a big, butcherly intruder, and hurled under the feet of the crowd. Scarce two seconds lasted her disappearance. Graham rushed forwards; he and the gentleman, a powerful man though grey-haired, united their strength to thrust back the throng; her head and long hair fell back over his shoulder: she seemed unconscious.

""Trust her with me; I am a medical man,"" said Dr. John.

""If you have no lady with you, be it so,"" was the answer. ""Hold her, and I will force a passage: we must get her to the air.""

""I have a lady,"" said Graham; ""but she will be neither hindrance nor incumbrance.""

He summoned me with his eye: we were separated. Resolute, however, to rejoin him, I penetrated the living barrier, creeping under where I could not get between or over.

""Fasten on me, and don't leave go,"" he said; and I obeyed him.

Our pioneer proved strong and adroit; he opened the dense mass like a wedge; with patience and toil he at last bored through the flesh-and-blood rock—so solid, hot, and suffocating—and brought us to the fresh, freezing night.

""You are an Englishman!"" said he, turning shortly on Dr. Bretton, when we got into the street.

""An Englishman. And I speak to a countryman?"" was the reply.

""Right. Be good enough to stand here two minutes, whilst I find my carriage.""

""Papa, I am not hurt,"" said a girlish voice; ""am I with papa?""

""You are with a friend, and your father is close at hand.""

""Tell him I am not hurt, except just in my shoulder. Oh, my shoulder!
They trod just here.""
""Dislocation, perhaps!"" muttered the Doctor: ""let us hope there is no worse injury done. Lucy, lend a hand one instant.""

And I assisted while he made some arrangement of drapery and position for the ease of his suffering burden. She suppressed a moan, and lay in his arms quietly and patiently.

""She is very light,"" said Graham, ""like a child!"" and he asked in my ear, ""Is she a child, Lucy? Did you notice her age?""

""I am not a child—I am a person of seventeen,"" responded the patient, demurely and with dignity. Then, directly after: ""Tell papa to come; I get anxious.""

The carriage drove up; her father relieved Graham; but in the exchange from one bearer to another she was hurt, and moaned again.

""My darling!"" said the father, tenderly; then turning to Graham, ""You said, sir, you are a medical man?""

""I am: Dr. Bretton, of La Terrasse.""

""Good. Will you step into my carriage?""

""My own carriage is here: I will seek it, and accompany you.""

""Be pleased, then, to follow us."" And he named his address: ""The Hôtel
Crécy, in the Rue Crécy.""
We followed; the carriage drove fast; myself and Graham were silent.
This seemed like an adventure.
Some little time being lost in seeking our own equipage, we reached the hotel perhaps about ten minutes after these strangers. It was an hotel in the foreign sense: a collection of dwelling-houses, not an inn—a vast, lofty pile, with a huge arch to its street-door, leading through a vaulted covered way, into a square all built round.

We alighted, passed up a wide, handsome public staircase, and stopped at Numéro 2 on the second landing; the first floor comprising the abode of I know not what ""prince Russe,"" as Graham informed me. On ringing the bell at a second great door, we were admitted to a suite of very handsome apartments. Announced by a servant in livery, we entered a drawing-room whose hearth glowed with an English fire, and whose walls gleamed with foreign mirrors. Near the hearth appeared a little group: a slight form sunk in a deep arm-chair, one or two women busy about it, the iron-grey gentleman anxiously looking on.

""Where is Harriet? I wish Harriet would come to me,"" said the girlish voice, faintly.

""Where is Mrs. Hurst?"" demanded the gentleman impatiently and somewhat sternly of the man-servant who had admitted us.

""I am sorry to say she is gone out of town, sir; my young lady gave her leave till to-morrow.""

""Yes—I did—I did. She is gone to see her sister; I said she might go:
I remember now,"" interposed the young lady; ""but I am so sorry, for
Manon and Louison cannot understand a word I say, and they hurt me
without meaning to do so.""
Dr. John and the gentleman now interchanged greetings; and while they passed a few minutes in consultation, I approached the easy-chair, and seeing what the faint and sinking girl wished to have done, I did it for her.

I was still occupied in the arrangement, when Graham drew near; he was no less skilled in surgery than medicine, and, on examination, found that no further advice than his own was necessary to the treatment of the present case. He ordered her to be carried to her chamber, and whispered to me:—""Go with the women, Lucy; they seem but dull; you can at least direct their movements, and thus spare her some pain. She must be touched very tenderly.""

The chamber was a room shadowy with pale-blue hangings, vaporous with curtainings and veilings of muslin; the bed seemed to me like snow-drift and mist—spotless, soft, and gauzy. Making the women stand apart, I undressed their mistress, without their well-meaning but clumsy aid. I was not in a sufficiently collected mood to note with separate distinctness every detail of the attire I removed, but I received a general impression of refinement, delicacy, and perfect personal cultivation; which, in a period of after-thought, offered in my reflections a singular contrast to notes retained of Miss Ginevra Fanshawe's appointments.

The girl was herself a small, delicate creature, but made like a model. As I folded back her plentiful yet fine hair, so shining and soft, and so exquisitely tended, I had under my observation a young, pale, weary, but high-bred face. The brow was smooth and clear; the eyebrows were distinct, but soft, and melting to a mere trace at the temples; the eyes were a rich gift of nature—fine and full, large, deep, seeming to hold dominion over the slighter subordinate features—capable, probably, of much significance at another hour and under other circumstances than the present, but now languid and suffering. Her skin was perfectly fair, the neck and hands veined finely like the petals of a flower; a thin glazing of the ice of pride polished this delicate exterior, and her lip wore a curl—I doubt not inherent and unconscious, but which, if I had seen it first with the accompaniments of health and state, would have struck me as unwarranted, and proving in the little lady a quite mistaken view of life and her own consequence.

Her demeanour under the Doctor's hands at first excited a smile; it was not puerile—rather, on the whole, patient and firm—but yet, once or twice she addressed him with suddenness and sharpness, saying that he hurt her, and must contrive to give her less pain; I saw her large eyes, too, settle on his face like the solemn eyes of some pretty, wondering child. I know not whether Graham felt this examination: if he did, he was cautious not to check or discomfort it by any retaliatory look. I think he performed his work with extreme care and gentleness, sparing her what pain he could; and she acknowledged as much, when he had done, by the words:—""Thank you, Doctor, and good-night,"" very gratefully pronounced as she uttered them, however, it was with a repetition of the serious, direct gaze, I thought, peculiar in its gravity and intentness.

The injuries, it seems, were not dangerous: an assurance which her father received with a smile that almost made one his friend—it was so glad and gratified. He now expressed his obligations to Graham with as much earnestness as was befitting an Englishman addressing one who has served him, but is yet a stranger; he also begged him to call the next day.

""Papa,"" said a voice from the veiled couch, ""thank the lady, too; is she there?""

I opened the curtain with a smile, and looked in at her. She lay now at comparative ease; she looked pretty, though pale; her face was delicately designed, and if at first sight it appeared proud, I believe custom might prove it to be soft.

""I thank the lady very sincerely,"" said her father: ""I fancy she has been very good to my child. I think we scarcely dare tell Mrs. Hurst who has been her substitute and done her work; she will feel at once ashamed and jealous.""

And thus, in the most friendly spirit, parting greetings were interchanged; and refreshment having been hospitably offered, but by us, as it was late, refused, we withdrew from the Hôtel Crécy.

On our way back we repassed the theatre. All was silence and darkness: the roaring, rushing crowd all vanished and gone—the damps, as well as the incipient fire, extinct and forgotten. Next morning's papers explained that it was but some loose drapery on which a spark had fallen, and which had blazed up and been quenched in a moment.",Charlotte Brontë,1990,"[82, 57, 34, 37, 37, 43, 58, 67, 75, 84]",10
340,Keep It Together,"[Verse 1]
Duck down the alley after midnight
Countin' your money with your headlights out
Look past the screen door, you can see her keepin'
Keepin' the party together

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, “I’m your painkiller on the corner
I’ll be the one that’s gonna turn you around
And besides, twenty-something amounts to nothing
When you’re dead in the ground.”

[Chorus]
She’s here to set you free
She’s got that somethin' that could put you at ease
And you could end up like a dog in the street
But she’ll still be here stayin' with it

[Verse 2]
Get your head up, get it out of your hands
Feelin' better was just a part of your plan
Just pay up a couple when you come back again, boy
So she can keep it together

341,True Blue Love,"Had enough of my yesterdays
Can't go back to mistakes that I've made

But don't let go, I've been a heart-selfish fool
It's a feeling I'm rising above
And I'll give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

And I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

Running hard in an empty race
Just take a look at the lines on this face
In my eyes you can measure the miles
But no one can measure desire

So take my hand, can you feel how it burns
Don't let go till your heart finally learns
Why this wandering soul has returned
To give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

And I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

And I know into one soul that's healing
Loneliness is the only thing you're feeling
Don't turn away from true blue love

I'll give you love, true love, true blue love
Give you true blue love

Now I know into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

Now I know into one soul that's healing
Loneliness is the only thing you're feeling
Don't turn away, away from true blue love

Into one heart that's shattered
Tenderness is the only thing that matters
Don't turn away from true blue love

No more loneliness
Just some tenderness

Maybe it's only tonight

Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will

[Chorus 2]
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

And looking for some parallel
Can be an endless game

We said goodbye before hello

348,I Come Off,"[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, ya, ya, you got it going on
Aah na-na, na-na

Now I wrote this record for when I perform
Lonely nights inside a university dorm
I put pen to paper with a paper and pen
For the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men
I get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddy
Krueger with a Luger turnin' men into spaghetti
I'm like Fats Domino, off of Blueberry Hill
Because my rhymes are funky fresh and not run of the mill
Just like a king has palaces I give an analysis
You can't talk because you suffer from paralysis
Of the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue
Comin' to you compliments of a brother named Young
Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless
So be quiet and let an educator teach this
It's due to my producer, so he's in a rage
And Mike you control the vinyl I'll control the stage
'Cause I come off

[Verse 2]
Four score and seven years ago
There were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know
Four score and seven years later
I dig holes in those rappers like the moon with a crater
Because to battle me you're really taking a risk
'Cause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc
Like Tyson drops boxers in rapid succession
That's how I'm droppin' MCs in the rappin' profession
I'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker
And I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snuka
Like a shuttle goes up into outer space
People's hands go up when I enter the place
I don't mean to brag or boast or to tell ya I'm great
But I can rock the microphone like Dorothy Hamill can skate
Yeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Louganis can dive
Don't have to be Saturday night for Young MC to get live
'Cause I come off

[Chorus]

Yo I come off, My name is Young MC and baby I come off
Yo the brother's comin' off, Bust this, Here we go

[Verse 3]
Now one behold, Young MC struck gold
From the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old
From the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb
From the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum
You know the other rappers wanna play a game with me
They run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC
Like a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be
So when I start I say Olly Olly Oxen Free
Yo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one
So pay attention cause you don't wanna miss one, of my healthy rhymes
Nobody's are healthier, New York, New Jersey, LA or Philadelphia
City to city, and town to town, place to place
Country to country, 'cause I get around
Even if you were in prison you'da heard me play
'Cause the warden had me rock and I'm on the PA
So when you get out come and see my show
And if you start static back in you go
'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam
And when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn
'Cause I come off

I come off. Yo baby, I come off. Here we go...",Young MC,1990,"[80, 75, 79, 79, 90]",5

And I've never met a girl like you before

[Verse 2]
You give me just a taste so I want more
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'Cause now you got me crawling, crawling on the floor
And I've never known a girl like you before

[Pre-Chorus]
You made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I'm talking metaphorically
Hope that I'm talking allegorically
Know that I'm talking 'bout the way I feel

And I've never known a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never
Never known a girl like you before

[Verse 3]
This old town's changed so much
Don't feel that I belong

From Geelong (payouts to workers affected by asbestos)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
Hey, hey, hey
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)

My gut is wrenched out, it is crunched up and broken
My life that is lived is no more than a token
Who'll strike the flint upon the stone and tell me why?
If I yell out at night there's a reply of blue silence
The screen is no comfort, I can't speak my sentence
They blew the lights at heaven's gate and I don't know why

But if I work all day on the Blue Sky Mine
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
Still I walk up and down on the Blue Sky Mine
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)

The candy store paupers lie to the shareholders
They're crossing their fingers, they pay the truth makers
The balance sheet is breaking up the sky
So I'm caught at the junction, still waiting for medicine
The sweat of my brow keeps on feeding the engine
Hope the crumbs in my pocket can keep me for another night

And if the Blue Sky Mining Company won't come to my rescue
If the sugar refining company won't save me
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?

But if I work all day on the Blue Sky Mine
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
And if walk up and down on the Blue Sky Mine
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)

And some have sailed from a distant shore
(And the company takes what the company wants)
And nothing's as precious as a hole in the ground

Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
I pray that sense and reason brings us in
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?

The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love

When I thought I needed to break free
But you were there to whisper in my ear
Why don't you share your dreams with me?

And those nights are growing colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder

And the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love

I don't mind 'cause you're all I can see

No where to hide, it's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart, wish we could go back to the start,
But oh my God is this real? No more time
It's too late, It's too late to say goodbye

Forced to watch the ashes floating, softly drifting to the ground

Than the way they are today

And love got lost along the way

You and I to try to make a change

The agent just called and said the Hawk was available, I'm ready
You all about the Hawk, nigga, that G5 is quality
It's pink, way more than I ever would've imagined
I didn't measure it so I'm higher than Aladdin
No swaps out, I'm undecided whenever I pop out
I had to swerve for four years, I'm still under forty thousand miles
Bought the Bentley coupe and a Bentley Spur on the same day
She drove the GT and fell in love with it the same day
She told me that was her favorite car, she dreamed about it
I couldn't walk away, my ego all in the way
I dropped cash on it, she told me she loved me even more (Freebandz)
These four doors and quaaludes, they got me dehydrated
Turn on me, sue me, no, nothing seems to amaze me
I left on a commercial flight and downgraded
If I could change anything, I wouldn't erase it (I wouldn't erase it)
Came back on a private plane and upgraded (I made it)
It had to be destiny, it had to be the recipe
Had to be the formula, I'm not normal, I told you (I told you)
If you would've took the flesh out me (Took the flesh out me)
You would've ran off with it and tried to convince me it was karma
(I bet she love me)

You say you feel disenchanted
Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you remained and
To hurt so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscing
Temptations so strong not to mention
The yearning inside

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

[Verse 2]
This feeling is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to lose if we blow it
This is no lie
Still, here we are both together
With promises made that we never
Yet feeling it now more than ever
I can't deny

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully

And when you needed me I came through

When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

Love letters in the sands - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day

Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
I climb through the window and down the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls

They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now

[Chorus]
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely, now

[Verse 3]
I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way
You watch them as they fall
Oh baby, they all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Where every night is just the same

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train

I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit

I've been down, but I'm up right now

'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla

You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead

What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin' on these hoes
Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us
Made a little money, still ain't got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open, don't say nothin'

For somebody else
But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him

(I never met no one
Who'd care if I was dead and gone)
Who needs me to care for them?
(Nobody needs me
Why should I just hang around?)

Why should I just sit and watch
While the others smile?
I just wish that someone cared
If I was happy for a while

Because I'm not satisfied
Everything I've tried
I don't like the way
Life has been abusing me

403,When The Night Comes,"Hold on I'll be back for you it won't be long
But for now there's something else that's calling me
So take me down that lonesome road
Point me east and let me go
That suitcase weighs me down with memories

I just want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone when the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes

Two spirits in the night
We can leave before the morning light
When there's nothing left to lose
There's nothing left to fear
So meet me on the edge of town
Won't keep you waiting I'll be around
Then you and I we'll just roll right out of here

I just want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone when the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes

I know there'll be a time when you and I
Could take our hands and run away
Pick up all the pieces of this shattered dream
We're gonna make it out some day
We'll be coming back, coming back to stay

I want to be the one you run to
To be the one you come to
I want to be the one you run to

I just want to be the one you run to
I want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone
When the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you

404,Another Day In Paradise,"[Verse 1]
Her body's gold like September
She burns through the night like an ember
And all those things we tried forgetting i remember
But we say we all fine we all fine
Sunny day dreams and we up now
Vodka lemonade I serve it up it goes down
75 degrees and a dope sound
All you need to live fine to live fine
A little sunshine cause she need it
A dose of rainfall in the evening
The waves crash down and we feel them
Say here’s to the nights we steal them
And I be running cause I figured out
The more I slow down the less I get out
And if we fall lets be strong now
Moving along we don’t mind we don’t mind

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fire
No need to leave, spend our whole lives
Another day in paradise

[Verse 2]
I be gone till November
Going through the letters that I send her
And think about the moment that I met her
Well I’ll be back in due time in due time
Touchdown throw off my own two shoes
Still the same city I be used to
And all the reckless things that we do
Keep us young, they're good signs they're good signs
Take a little more if you need it
Voices of the night won’t mislead it
The tide pulls me in but it takes slow
Here’s to the nights we let go
And I’m hoping that they figure out
It’s all about the scenery along the route
No fears and no problems
These moments are so kind, they're so kind

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fight
No need to leave, spend the whole night
Another day in paradise

[Bridge]
I don’t need what I’ve sowed
I just need something good
And I know when we’re old
We’ll look back and say “some
Mistakes we made, they made us who we are
These games we played they got us really far""
That shit to most won’t ever mean a thing
But it got us here, so I hold on

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright

I feel them snapping at me
I feel the pressure inside building ‘til I try to break free

I can’t believe what I’ve done
I should have never begun
I feel the pressure inside telling me I never was the one

I feel them laughing at me
I feel them snapping at me

Bangin' when the only niggas boomin' was the cold flamez
Funny I'm the only nigga with a known name

414,Principal's Office,"[Intro]
Now normally if I can help But I don't spend a lot of time in a principal's office
(RING!!!)
What?
9'o clock

[Verse 1]
Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing
Runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing
And as I get to the office I can hardly speak
Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week
So to my first class I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And as I get to the room I hear the teacher say
""Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today""
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat
So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand
And said, ""Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?""
The teacher got upset, and she screamed out ""No!
It's off the principal's office you go.""

[Verse 2]
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria
Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke cause my front tooth is out of place
So I walked to school with ice on my lip
The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I'm walking, I'm dragging
Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it
Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball
With the late pass I got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says ""What do you know?
It's off to the prinicipal's office you go.""

Recess!

[Verse 3]
Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feelings
Give me a week B, and the girl'll be dealing
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said ""Hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC""
But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes would begin
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me ""You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you""
So then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, the sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter
When I finished the note, it was ready to pass
The teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
Even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late
For me to write another note cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me, and I said ""I know
It's off to the principal's office I go.""

416,I Will Survive,"[Intro]
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

[Verse 1]
And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive",Gloria Gaynor,1990,"[99, 82, 76, 61, 53, 56, 61, 62]",8
417,This One's For The Children,"This is a very serious message
So all of you please listen

There are some people living in this world
They have no food to eat
They have no place to go
But we all are God's children

We've got to learn to love one another
Just remember
They could be us
Remember, we all are brothers

But help others in need
And show them there's a better way

This one's for the children
The children of the world
This one's for the children
May God keep them in His throne

Many people are happy
And many people are sad
Some people have many things
That others can only wish they had

So for the sake of the children
Show them love's the only way to go
'Cause they are tomorrow
And people, they've got to know

I'm not trying to darken up your day
But help others in need
And show them there's a better way

Why she send these kissy face emojis to my phone? (huh?)

She gon' slob on my knob like a corn on the cob
But we can't go out in public, there's paparazzi to dodge
As I'm droppin' the top, told her shoot for the stars
I know she gon' love me because every woman does
As I slide in that water she get wet like a slide
No I cannot stop her, she gon' go like a ride
Keep that thing clean, it be smellin' like some Tide
But no I cannot wife her so it's lookin' like divide

It was me and the gang, we was lookin' like a tribe

She was talkin' all tough, but I got her walkin' stiff
We had a bet that if I hit it good, she would make me meals
You would think it's homicide how I hit her with the steel
All this energy it took, I should hit her with a bill
She really want it all so I hit her with a lil'
Yeah she say she want some more, say that's all I got to give

And blinds you with its light

Lays stretched across the hills
From distances it's glistening
Like El Dorado's halls

And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scared
Where only fools find gold

It's all I'll ever need, it's all I'll ever need
When I see you smile, I can face the world, ooh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light, ooh
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me
Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in, I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at ya baby
Can make everything alright, yeah, everything's alright, so right
When I see you smile, I can face the world, ooh
You know I can do anything, yeah
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light, ooh
I see it shining right through the rain, yeah
When I see you smile, yeah I can face the world, ooh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile, oh yeah, baby
When I see you, smile, smile at me, at me",Uncle Sam,1990,"[85, 79, 67, 55, 47, 38]",6
427,Over And Over,"[Verse 1]
From the way you smile
To the way you look
You capture me
Unlike no other
From the first hello
Yeah, that’s all it took
And suddenly
We had each other

[Pre-Chorus]
And I won’t leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

So don’t ever think I need more
I’ve got the one to live for

Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won’t get broken
We’ll never forget this moment
It will stay brand new
‘Cause I’ll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again

From the heat of night
To the break of day
I’ll keep you safe
And hold you forever
And the sparks will fly
They will never fade

428,Never 2 Much Of U,"There's never too much of you
The sun goes up the sun goes down
Think of you when you're not around
So I call you up on the phone
You tell me that you're there all alone

Now I know it sounds funny
But I gotta know
If I come right over
Can I let my feeling show?
Baby
Cause you've been so good so good to me
You're the kind of lover I really do need
You're all I need

There's never too much of you
Just keep all this good love coming
Just me giving you love
There's never too much of you
Every day and every night
You're on my mind

I see you in the morning light
I remember all the good things we shared last night
It's so wrong so right
I know better than to let you go
I want to have you next to me
Don't you know
Don't you go
Don't, oh

Oh girl
I want you
I want to give you all you need
I need you
You know what I need

A friendly love
That's what you are
I'm wishing on your love on the brightest star
You and me can be this way all the time
And I know if you love me so
I'll never ever let you go, baby

Take my heart
It's yours
Just stay with me
Just keep all this good love coming
There's no way I'm letting you go

You're my sunshine
You're my moonlight
You and me
Make me feel so right

You make me feel so good
I love you",Dino (Dean Esposito),1990,"[88, 70, 61, 65, 72, 74]",6
429,Don't Close Your Eyes,"[Verse 1]
I know you loved him a long time ago
Even now in my arms you still want him I know
But darling this time let your memories die
When you hold me tonight, don't close your eyes

[Chorus]
Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
Don't close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Maybe I've been a fool, holding on all this time
Lying here in your arms, knowing he's in your mind
But I keep hoping some day that you'll see the light
Let it be me tonight, don't close your eyes

[Chorus]
Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

[Chorus]
Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known

430,"Timeless Love (From ""Shocker"")","[Round 1: B. Dot]
So you wanted Lux, lil' nigga! Woooow!
You was reachin' for God, then they passed you me
Blasphemy
No Loaded
I should've came suited for the kill
Nah, to keep it real, all I need is a casual tee for this casualty
I've been gunnin' at you, Julian
The first couple shots missed, bad accuracy
But the third round hit, SMACK outta nowhere, Traffic 3
I'm just glad to be, in ya presence
We done heard the tallest tales about the smallest legend
Y'all think he a murderer
But to me, when a nigga lack conviction [?] a legend
You a fraud, I said it
Cause real shooters come off the hip quick
One motion, the energy is all kinetic
In everyone of yo' gun bars you starin' down the pistol
And pause for seconds, but what, is the arm electric?
Like why you always in shock every time you palm the Wesson?
This is God's perception
And yo' bars is...random, what an odd selection
When a nigga good at shootin' shots, but then got a prob' directin'
And y'all waitin' for rounds that he drop in his game to line up that we never saw connectin'
Is this all you sketchin'?
With an illustration that it all impressive
Yeah, you got a pen, so (pencil)? What that mean to a nigga that real draw the weapon?
We gon' trace this back to where we first saw progression
Back when bein' gangsta wasn't dawg profession
Used to stay dancin', and now you got all these guns
The K clappin'
Well that motion went from one arm to the next
And I guess that's how ya wave happen
Look I ain't askin'
I got ya future in my hands like I'm palm readin'
You get to runnin', I get to gunnin', let the long reach him
A chrome pop, the dome shot, the robot, y'all like, ""What the god meanin'?""
That mean I let the fifth fly and catch him mid stride, left his body stiff, but had his arms swingin'
This is bar season
I've had games versus lames that didn't write well
And well I'm here to write wit' a nigga I compare to
Aye Smack I'm finna Strike
Not like these other niggas, I didn't mean to scare you
I'm finna strike, I'm in the URL, bowling for pins (pens) and JC, I won't spare you
I got clear view, the way I see murder (C-Murder), it ain't No Limit to me airin' you wit' the strap
But I'd rather get your railroaded
The agony of ya screams will be music to my ears, and here's the Shocker, you always sound terrible on a track
This is facts, and dawg (dog), for all that malpractice another vet' is gettin' killed
You said you was the greatest in the world!
Now you runnin' out of space your circle gettin' cropped, they done put an alien in the field
Yeah,  you got drive, but you in a vehicle, you ain't registered to wheel
They put a bait car, on ya road to Lux and you ain't even notice  you got set up for the steal
This the build, I'm a rise and I'm catchin' you while you sinkin'
Nigga I'm it, you should've known you gettin' tagged, you catchin' me while I'm peakin', I'm leakin'
All the info on why you excel
Cause you stole Anubiis whole style, just slowed it down but I must admit you do this well
Let the truth prevail
And leave it to me to be the nigga that see through the veil
I figured you'd disagree, so I brought the hammer
For ya teeth so we can argue this tooth and nail
Nigga, you can tell, when a nigga whole demeanor foul
But he still wanna be seen as pals
That's JC, after every verse, it's ""Aye, aye, good shit, my nigga."" Handshake with a cheesy smile
You friendly-ass nigga, don't you see how that comradery don't appease the crowd?
BAOW! And before I shoot again, I add an attachment to the end
Just like him, I'm extending the arm in between the rounds
Can't y'all see he foul?
Tryin' to direct the crowd by slowin' down?
I know ya style, but colder, pal
I pull out and aim, left and right wit' the .40 cal'
Had the whole buildin' duckin', up and down, doin' the wave, nigga that's how I control the crowd
Can't believe this clown, and all the shit y'all let him get away with
Y'all know he don't spray clips, that's why he emphasis every line, every line
And y'all pay him for that over compensation
Yeah he write it well, but may as well write in braille
Peep the explanation
He always tryin' to bump it up a notch just so we can feel when you say shit
That's basic
But the Ike Turner-Annie Mae (anime) shit? Amazin'!
But pay attention, listen
It's all kinda contradictions of the statement
I mean this character you created? Is only based off the pen
So (pencil) whatever you draw up is the writtens we engage wit'
But without the notebook you get no look
Just a bunch of still shots of your colorful imagination
That's anime shit (animation)
When a nigga picks are (Pixar) only put in motion when we flippin' through the pages
I am dangerous!
And after this, you won't get booked a lot
I'm here to jooks ya spot
Where I'm from, they don't criticize the form - blaow!
They like, ""Blood why you shoot him?"" - they criticize why we even took the shot!
You get hooked and dropped, and if it ain't a fist fight, then you better shoot first
Or they gon' think you Verb, the way you standin' across from a long-ass clip, shit spittin' longer than a Mook third
Suwoop's heard, worldwide, I got all the red rags ridin' wit' me
So when I talk about P card, it ain't got nothin' to do with a Survivor Series
We united clearly
Where I'm from, all the Pirus is politickin' with the Locs
Cause this is the west and he mid, so y'all should've known it was different smoke
I approach, Smack like, ""What the fuck you give me Carter for (4)?""
I can't believe this shit, I shoot him in the chest, {deep breath} he tryin' to catch his breath {deep breath}, can't breathe and shit
Then his knees is bent
This ain't gonna to work (Twork) out for you Julian
{Twork voice} My grievances!
When Wheezy drop, y'all gon' know it was me, Baby: I finally released the fif' (5)!
I'm a beast with this
And this that black African power
And if these is ya last days, Julian, this is yo' last hour

[Round 1: JC]
Yo!
What's poppin', Beloved Dot?
This is not no fuckin' lecture, this will not be an opportunity for us to lead us wrong
But to each his own
All though this would be level playin' field, this is not an opportunity to play in field, I swing for home
As far as this...Loaded...rapid-fire style you got
Well, it's kind of a weapon, just not for protection
What y'all think is more useful in this line of profession?
B. Dot with his lessons or a dot on a Wesson?
Class in session!
You line 'em up, I'll pile 'em up
There's too many sides to B. Dot
Well whether or not he leave conscious, we gon' see a lot of Blood
There's too many sides
I embody what actually makes us unique: writin'
I mean, me slackin' that never been the truth
Whether it's slaving like Levar Burton, or drummin' like Questlove, I represent The Roots
And you a victim of it
I'm just waitin' on a day he face it
He can't replace it
I aim and blaze it
I  would say it would leave him hangin' like Michael Jackson, baby, but that'd be a Blanket statement
They brought you here cause you finish, ain't no debatin'
We already got Lux, and his pro creation is no replacement
Even at soul, that close to basic
Y'all know them games y'all can just beat whenever you want to?
Exactly, ain't no point in savin'
And I'm the reaper
My pistol licensed, ain't no need to keep my shit low
My camp right in the streets like Skid Row
Don't switch flows, play that part for real, guard ya grill
Cause that art to kill, follows you when you wake up
Esau and Jacob, I'm on his heels
Every step you take, you dodgin' slugs
You wake up, surrounded by doctor scrubs
He repped his set the whole time, but bein' unconscious won't stop the Blood
Listen, Beloved Dot, you need some help
We already got one Loaded
So unless you gon' change yo' name to ""Unloaded"", you should just be yourself
'Cause before you know it, the hood surrounds
You look around, it's a bunch of niggas, pullin' pounds
You see a bald head, and I'm not standin' over Verb with the hoodie down
Nigga they put a lot in front of me, but it was not for company
I won't say the house was on it, but a certain amount was on it, your head exactly
Anytime somethin' spill over here they put a Bounty on it
I'm just here to re-jog ya steps, see how well you write from the grave
Create a new coffin text
See we not as dumb
I mean I will leave that knowledge stuck on the wall of Kemet
Put that bullshit right back where you got it from
I get charged up, then it's slow incisions, so specific
And you gon' answer to the same charge as ya co-defendants
So where ya options go?
'Cause you can die here, it's not a quote
I get all you finished, revolver spinnin' 'til my comp is (compass) broke
I'm just seein' what you made of, that's why I aim for the heart
Been killin' all you so called names and that's my favorite part
I'm more complex then them pyramids they studied
It's like the whole time they didn't know I was aimed for the stars
Bitch, I'm aligned specific, you know it's only one way to the top
You can only get there by rhymin' gifted
You gotta climb it different, well you tried and missed it
And whatever's involved, you were supposed to learn to weather it all, but I climb it (our climate) different
And I'm right too
Word to Caitlyn Jenner you transparent (trans' parent), I see right through
This crap you call ""life"" is not somethin' you supposed to roll dice to
They told you, ""[?] kill JC?"" He garbage too
But that accuracy bothers you
'Cause as soon as you heard Lux on ya side, you duck, 'cause you know that nigga's a target, too
It's body bags at every battle
Make sure ya homie found one
But do not jump in that bitch yet - this is only Round 1
1-0

[Round 2: B. Dot]
My nigga, I don't wanna hear no bars, Loaded wit' clone shit
You'd be a stupid fuck to try to group me up
Besides, you and Beloved can still battle in the future bruh
They just sent you back to the past to get blast from Looper Lux
You in hot water, and I don't give a fuck who souped you up
Whoever got you carried away, gon' have to carry ya weight after I dead you and they suit you up
Do you suwoop or what?
You put on the flame hoodie, they thought you was the biggest Blood since the time of Suge
I'm like, ""Wait, this ain't fair, he tell (fairy tale) lies
A lil' red don't mean he's from a Riding Hood ."" Look in his eyes
You could, y'all know Gotti's slogan, we gotta trust that
Y'all wanna know why my nigga Geechi's eyes is always squinted?
'Cause when you shoot a nigga close-range, you gotta anticipate the blood splat
And you? Lil' nigga never was that
So we gon' skip this shit about you bein' undisputed
That's the wrong message in the venue
I mean you can't be too sharp off the 'gnac (Yak)
If got you believin' you a god with all these arms but I guess that's what the Hen' do (Hindu)
Let's get into, how you just another battle rap artist that'll take a deposit to fake like the hardest
You listen to descriptions of killers and draw, every one of yo' rounds is a facial composite
When I break you a part a this (artist)
Don't be sad, they gon' ask, ""Why B even fuckin' with J?"" That's an ugly match to make like The Carters
They always say he ""Cut from the cloth"", 'til he in front of the nigga that's makin' the garments
JC, let's be honest
Your ego and your insecurities is enormous
Like how a nigga used to be a dancer, and want y'all to forget about the past so bad
That when he get on the stage and rap he won't even give you performance!?
It's alarmin', how you only wanna be seen as a writer
Don't want nobody to forget you nicer
Yeah, you slowed down the style
'Cause you don't wanna fuck around and bust a dance move if you get too hyper
Blood, I get it, it's a marathon
That's why you slowin' down the pace
But look behind you, need I remind you
All these opponents closin' in ya space
Do a freestyle rebuttal, act out ya bars, add some more components in this race
You can't just keep pullin' out the pen (pin)
Sooner or later, it's all gon' blow up in ya face!
But before that detonate, I wanna practice what I'm preachin' and demonstrate
I wanna take that same pen (pin) grenade bar with a new style
To show you how, with cadence and flow it can be done a better way
Like, I let the flow switch up for this hoe nigga, that react to his own bars
Applauding his own lines and disguise it in showman stuff
""I'm the Greatest In The World!""
He ad-libbing, so y'all listen and show him love
Just check him out, fit it in ya head how I'm addressin' (a dressing) his whole getup
You can't just keep pullin' out the pen (pin), but then again
That makes sense for a nigga that's used to blowin' his whole shit up!
And y'all quote his stuff
This lil' nigga don't call shots
If he a thug, life is sick, and I thought we got rid of the smallpox
He tappin' y'all, wit' elementary shit and I'm really from the School Of Hard Knocks
This the drop out
Tellin' his mama he in class, just another nigga fakin' it
Well this is Sex-Ed and if the Magnum pop, whatever go inside ya fresh egg is takin' life instead of makin' it
I'm bankin' it nigga
Whatever you tryin' to infer, know I'm liver nigga
Yeah you abstract but if I give my boys the queue (Q) they puttin' Tips on this Vibrant nigga
Who ridin' witcha?
I'mma need to see some Michigan goons, gangstas and goblins nigga
If not, then as soon as you blink a nickle squeeze
But you prolly think you all three
Yeah you know, these (Ds) niggas from the Glove, can get to thinkin' they triple Gs
Negro, please!
You no mustache havin', whiskers like a rat
Compared to Ill, you wack
Nigga, that's the Yak
This nigga lookin' all kind of rat
We see police and don't speak
Keep 12 up in the dark like an insomniac
You done found ya match
And tonight, perhaps we can settle this huge debate
I'm not the nigga you can confuse today
Like why you take all these battles back-to-back-to-back
That's what a lot of these other dudes will say
You claim you eat off it, even though the flow dirty, which means you refused a plate
When Calicoe was killin' shit, he was gainin'
So, explain it: does that mean you losin'? Wait... (weight)
Skinny nigga we gon' need an intervention
Listen, I'm not tryin' to intrude ya space
I just think everybody in the room is fake
Like some Kardashians the way we scared to say
""Hey, we wanna get you some help. We think you usin' yay' ('Ye).""
Have you used today?
I'm into savin', so I'm checkin', I don't want you to start to shake on us
I mean you gotta take in to account, after I clean you out, you gon' go through withdrawls from all them drug deposits
You can bank on this
Y'all gotta think on this
A fiend is usually insecure, that's why they find comfort in the stone smoke
I seen him out in L.A., Traffic 3 with like five or six swole folk
Guess you figured when you touched down, you scorin' believability, almost
Just when you thought you got your extra point across we just keep movin' that goal post
You was around Pirus and some Crips that'll make you change that Tone Loc
You ain't know if shit was about to pop
Am I lyin'? That's why you brought them Detroit linemen
Yeah, like they know shit about the block
This gots to stop
These stories, that you build upon and that way that it's told to them, far fetched
But you the architect, so you build up walls to block the writer inside withholding the concept
I mean the dancer, the rapper, the clapper, I'm knowin' they all mesh
I get you, it fits you
These personalities you switch to, is residential
They all livin' inside ya Napoleon Complex!
Get a hold of yaself, let the ego go
You know what will help him
Baow, your soul flyin' outside of ya body
You finally gettin' over yourself
You know this is felt
And this that black African power
If these is ya last days, Julian, then this is ya last hour

[Round 2: JC]
Let's not pretend, that you here for a religious awakenin', not again
You solidified yo' slave mentality battlin' Loso, wearin' some of that same shit that they mock us in (moccasin)
To be honest, I think you should research and learn a little bit a little bit of your history more
'Cause that shit on your face made you look like the monkey watchin' Simba be born
All that shit, just so niggas can jump to the top?
They gotta stop it
It's not a hit for you, financial or spiritual, you're not a prophet/profit
Or a witness, you claim Blood but have zero of it pourin' wit' 'em
Then by the third round, you are everything but Muslim and Mormon pitchin'
And, to be more specific
He doesn't even share our roots, but it's not illegal to get money off imported business or foreign visit
So we holdin' it down
We knowin' he not from here, so we gon' raise the scope wit' a smile and then we gon' go sightseein' and show him a round
No, bitch, the torch is burnin'
I told y'all vers' Danny Myers, what to do wit' a body
You suppose to earn (urn) it
The clip, longer than the wait at the hospital wit' no insurance
Nigga don't just reach in those bars Beloved Dot
Keep them hands sharp
'Cause that same aim been droppin' you lames where you stand, I call 'em landmarks
Let 'em disfigure, these hands sharp as Johnny Depp with the scissors
I've got this spot forever
You cold (coal), but they tryin' to make a diamond outta you, you under a lot of pressure
I mean the proof is in the pudding, right? You believe the shit?
Well cause we is yet to see the shit
That's why I catch bodies, I'm from the Glove, the Proof is in the fingerprint
That's why I make niggas write
No more extra antics for the fame it gets him
I made the game a victim
Like a virus, my click (clique) fire when it change the system
Now it feel different
This shit worse than a 360 contract
That mean you got a upfront deal wit' it
Which explains why they keep goin' to them guns
They literally lookin' for the meal (mil') ticket
So let me get this right, we supposed to believe, it used to be gang gang
Thangs changed, so you can unify us half the battle, but the other half supposed to be bet-
Bitch stop the switchin'
Llama's spittin' at this walkin' contradiction
Big guns, Super C on Nintendo, that's actual Contra-diction
That line, won't relate to masses
That's old school, like segregated classes
That's why I only black
I still get Tweeted off shit I said in my first year
You think I care if I don't react?
I know my shit is timeless
And every move I made, outside of the playbook, won't none of ya coaches find it
But they know I ride, and if I'm there, there's a lot of figures close behind
Like everything that Oprah sign
The reason they don't like you, these fuckin' contradictions
It's just like you, Smack called and said I got B. Dot
I almost went on Strike too
It's niggas like you, we just get 'em dogged on the spot
Then he get hit wit' the .40 too (42) and it's not the Laws Of Maat
Nigga the squad for whatever
Oh but them Kemetic third rounds against a nigga who know better?
He not ready for that part of the lecture, but pardon professor
I heard those third rounds be yo' hardest semester
Well what about that against a nigga- well nah
Mine against yo' third round, we can combine throwin' up Blood and bein' conscious together
Bitch, I'm the clip-squeezer!
Fuck is a Kemetic Blood to the crypt (Crip) keeper?
I polished it, acknowledge it
It's gon' take you all the science in Kemet to get you outta this
'Cause once Smack said I had to make time for this and I decided to fit you in this slaughter
You went from Los Angeles to lost like Atlantis is
'Cause no matter where he sit, he (city) underwater
Round 2!
2-0!

[Round 3: B. Dot]
Look not upon me because I am black
Versus Iron, when you started that, I sorta clapped
But then I got reminded, they may be blinded
But a nigga like me, can see through them distorted raps
You made it a black vs white thing, so of course we was supportin' that
But Africa the motherland
So how you gon' vacay away and think that's gon' resort to facts
This was all an act
You prolly felt incredible, for the obvious reachin'
And y'all thought he was probably preachin'
Yeah that was a song of Solomon, but that was a female talkin' in the scripture, it wasn't even Solomon speakin'
Here I go wit' the teachin', about how I think all of these religions is big jokes
But when I think about it y'all way (Yahweh), maybe it is divine intervention
How that video you made never landed in the hand of Chris Stokes, but we gon' skip though
Back to Solomon, I don't think he even existed, let alone was he anointed with pigment
I'm 'bout to show y'all the distance
Between a nigga that's always pointin' to the pen
And somebody that's pinpointin' the difference
For instance, I was named a clone
And seemingly, I thought I was in that race alone
Til JC started conscious rantin', with his third eye, ravin' (raven)
Well I see the future in this Game Of Thrones
Ask Daylyt, who changed his soul
I was the one! Before me it was number twos on any stage he on
He was sleepin', barely breathin'
Think sleep apnea cause after we wrapped it up, it was oxygen in the mask and he came back strong
And that's what made me known
Without my nigga 'Lyt that day I would've never got acknowledged
Y'all was talkin' 'bout knockin' a niggas brains to the floor 'til I came through truly droppin' knowledge
And y'all applaud this novice?
Versus Iron y'all said he was as conscious as Dot is
Cause he told the white man we the original, do y'all understand how unoriginal that thought is?
I mean it's awkward to all of a sudden start rappin' wit' purpose but only scratch at the surface
Y'all gotta look at his material
The fabric-ated lines, the wool over eyes, it's always a disguise when they wolfing out the Biblical
It's principle, and you gotta be from certain schools of thought to understand how Hebrews was taught
You thought you was breakin' new ground
Well I'm here to shake up the Earth 'bout those lines that you used at fault
We Africans, not Hebrews, let's not confuse this part
You struck Iron before it was hot
And I'ma go into that same book you used to diffuse his spark
Let's view this arc, y'all know a nigga know this shit
But peep how cold it gets
Noah was drunk and he got mad at his son Ham cause he noticed it
But focus quick, cause in the Bible, Ham is supposed to represent Africa
So Noah cursed him, said, ""Your descendants will be slavin'. Your son Canaan and anything comin' after ya.""
So, add this up, and when you equal the sum, break this down and explain to me
So you claim that original Jew shit?
So you cool wit', a book that was used when the white man was justifyin' slavery?
It amazes me, how I give y'all direction and y'all still let the white man change the route
It's like ya battle vs T-Top
Even when you try to put on blacks, somewhere we still see white tee hangin' out
Jews lied about they whole history
Abraham never existed and God didn't choose a few
Black people we are west Africans, them stories ain't got nothin' to do witchu
But you, do what you usually do
So I'm not complainin' anymore
About a parasite that need a host to get on track
I mean Smack, you just another train that he can board
Said he wasn't believable, that's when he found a new Vice and start bangin' to the core
Well of course, I'm not surprised
Here go another god named JC claimin' that he Lord
I mean sure, you gang bang, you from the hood after all
Nigga stop, you a good kid, don't poke ya chest out when you never had to brawl
And if you did have beef wit' niggas, y'all prolly squared it up to dance it off
When I'm from, when niggas show out then we clap applaud
No lyin' (Lion) King, we was taught to keep a grip
Don't slip in a stampede cause the pride never lands after fall
We was dialed in, where lil' niggas like this never had to call
That's why I'm mad at y'all
Y'all let this good kid Julian rap about gats too long
He could've did anything wit' the pen
Instead he tryin' to be gangsta to get some respect that he feel like he lack from y'all
JC in the desert, gettin' tempted
But the guns, drugs, bitches and cash involved
You said, ""Jesus was black""? Well even though the facts is flawed
You should know, when you God, you can't be tempted by shit cause you already have it all
This is class for dawg, you can't fuck around like you new to (neuter) this
I see who the pupil is
Well class is in session, come learn you a lesson, little nigga I'm finna tutor this
Let's maneuver this, idea that religion is what makes our survival
Cause here we have a Vice Lord sayin' he Hebrew, I can't believe you claimin' the title
Gee, these (GD) niggas got me confused cause
Hebrews use the Star of David, now this information is vital
Cause this same six point star, is also used by the Gangster Disciples
Aye, Vice Lord, ain't them your rivals?
This is tribal, and you the (Judah) one that think black people cursed cause we broke God's commandments
Like, Thou Shall Not Kill
Yet in still in all yo' battles you kill, nigga I can't understand this
Who plants this, seed that make y'all believe this tree can grow for the greater good
Cause you can be killed by a GD, rockin' the same symbol that represents what yo' nation should
You can't be Vice Lord and praise the black Christ Lord, there ain't no way you could
So here's the detail
Next time I see you throw up that V.L
I'ma break your wrist and drop you off in the wrong neighborhood
You gettin' flamed for good
You in here wit' the fire starter
The letter ""J"" don't exist in the Hebrew language
So when we take it off ya name it explains how you lyin' Carter
You gon' die a martyr
You should've never taken me bro
And since you Vice Lord, then tell us, have you taken your oath?
You see, Hebrews believed that Yahweh the only god in the sky
But when you Vice Lord, you gotta take an oath
And inside that oath says ""God is Allah""
So are you Muslim or Hebrew? Which one of them you choose?
Maybe you never signed that Vice Lord oath
All this talk about a pen that was never really put to use
I'm a bit confused
All I need is a pro test (protest) for y'all to see this shit
Every other bar he callin' the cop or nick something when he squeeze the fifth
If I talked about the white man, I really mean the shit
He used the race card just to bait y'all, he must see you as fish
But if you know about anything that he brews (Hebrews), J, C (see) they don't even believe you (Jew) exist
I'm your crucifix
And this that black African power
And if these is yo' last days Julian, then this was yo' last hour

[Round 3: JC]
Black power right, Beloved Dot?
That's startin' to seem like one of your comfort spots
So let's rap 'bout the shit
Cause too many niggas ask 'bout the shit
A conscious gang banger is a contradiction, we've acknowledged this
First two rounds, no black power shit, I'ma kill you, bang bang
Third round, ""Nigga...y'all gotta snap outta this.""
The same cat, who will paint his face vs Loso to show where his brain at
Will tell his black brother, ""We need to unify"" before lettin' them thangs clap
You wanna know why that Kemet shit not for us? One strange fact
There was kings there, we were slaves here
Where is it in Kemet that can explain that?
Now it's yo' time to be saved
Stop paintin' yo' fuckin' face and tellin' other niggas how to behave
Stop actin' like you got the third rounds that contain the answers for black problems today
Stop goin' home and writin' bullshit songs tryin' to get a response from Kanye
And, do you like my fuckin' fit today?
I figured you would, it's my way of makin' light of the fraudulent shit you say
And it get more and more sick
This was sent to me, by a student of Polite's and a classmate of yours, and you won't ignore it
Cause you do way too much unity preachin' with these bum ass letters to Kanye in yo' home recordings
To have yo' personal classmates hittin' me up cause you won't support him
He won't support him, the fuckin' irony
And niggas think it's cause of yo' teacher?
I say it's cause what he taught you
You lost too, you left Christianity to follow more shit you don't belong to
And yo' mission, is to guide a bunch of lost niggas...nowhere
And that shit can only be done with evil in mind
Marco Polo, not the writer, even though he was another thief of his time
But I mean the game, where a whole purpose is misleadin' the blind
The fact that you claim Blood every other battle, that's only how silly niggas movin'
I mean if you not lost, this is like right in the middle of you losin'
You niggas run wit' that religion 'til the beast sit him like a Buddhist
You pray, to a top dog like the image of Anubis
I do this
I really don't know what to take from y'all
I mean it's more dimensions to you than the pyramids y'all worship
From the stones to the ancient walls
The problem is the fact that we need to unify comes after the red raggin'
Not sayin' it's not a place at all, but it's contradictory
Ref, you gotta drop that flag before you make the call
The fact that we need to unify, always come after this red rag shit
Not sayin' it's not a place at all, but it's hypocrisy
Ref, you gotta drop that flag before you make the call
But no response necessary, silence is golden
That's why I always use it when I let the ratchet off
Lay a fag in chalk
All y'all gon' hear is a body drop, like when Maggie walk
This that same nigga who mirrored the image of Loaded Lux
Then thought that it would help him skip the ropes
Didn't get that feature he wanted, realized Lux (luck's) not on his side, then that mirror broke
This the smoke niggas died from
Survivors can lose a lung from it
Engaging with the ratchets soon as I touch 'em, it's like we rushin' (Russian) shit
The shit meant to get under ya skin, that's why niggas get cut from it
They switch up, but I can tell by the cloth you switched too, you not really cut from it
You supposed to kill them niggas before you die, you done made my bucket list
Jungle shit, grip on me like it's tailored; custom fit
Don't mention it, it's not worth the shot
And I won't mention y'all criticizin' the form on a perfect shot
But it's worth the shot and it's worth the watch
I get all the troops then we purge the spot
Then we target you, then we circle Dot
With all the proof, you a wild liar
You want these niggas to say you woke? Were your rounds fire?
If we really do need to unify
Then what the fuck is all the red raggin' in the rounds prior?
Don't even answer that!
Let's just say I'm about that kill-a-nigga life too, let's just say we not better
You can relieve my efforts
Replace yo' third rounds with one of mine
BAOW! I like the unconscious B. Dot better
That's for tryin' to resist
One shot, he gotta have all his vitamins sipped
But if I let these two point? Five
Word to Smack the first thing gets striked will end quick
B. Dot, it is over with
Overdose from the dopest pen
And y'all know I wrote the shit
Cause y'all just witnessed this nigga's eulogy
My condolences",URLtv,1990,"[95, 87, 85, 85, 91]",5

Abnormal
Niggas pussy snitching on me informin'
And I ain't with the bullshit
I got a deal and I still be on that bullshit
I'ma warn your ass another time
Call my nigga numba 9
Nuski got the strap still
Make your family go and make a will
Police niggas go and make a deal
OTF I'm in this shit for real

[Chorus]
Where you was at when I was in that war?
I had nobody but me and my boys
You niggas frauds yall ain't making noise
But I ain't take it personal

Now where you was when I was fightin' all them homicides

433,Figure Of Eight,"[Chorus 1]
Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know

[Verse 1]
Why can't we travel a continuous line?
Make a love a reliable covenant all the time
Up and down the hills I go
I got to know
I got to know

[Chorus 2]
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight

[Bridge]
Well, figure it out for yourself, little girl
I don't go nowhere at all
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall

[Chorus 1]
Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know

[Chorus 2]
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other

434,Living In Sin,"[Verse 1]
I don't need no license
To sign on no line
And I don't need no preacher
To tell me you're mine
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no new bride
I just need you, baby
To look me in the eye
I know they have a hand time
And your Daddy don't approve
But I don't need your Daddy
Telling us what we should do
Now there's a million questions
I could ask about our lives
But I only need one answer
To get me through the night

[Chorus]
So baby, can you tell me just where we fit in
I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in
I say we're living on love they say we're living in sin

[Verse 2]
Is it right for both our parents
Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights
Or wear that ring of diamonds
When your heart is made of stone
You can talk but still say nothing
You stay together but alone
Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight
They say the promise is forever
If you sign it on the dotted line

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
I call it love they call it living in sin
Living in sin

The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
Way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me

It ain't the clothes that you wear
It ain't the things that you buy
It ain't your house on the hill

436,The Last Worthless Evening,"[Verse 1]
I know you broke up with him
And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself
You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim

I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else
And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

[Chorus 1]
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause I'll be there
When your broken heart is on the mend

[Verse 2]
Every night it's the same old crowd in smoky rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms
I've been around this block a time or two
And I've made some big mistakes
But girl I promise you, I promise you

[Chorus 2]
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening

[Verse 3]
People inside their houses
With the shades pulled down
God knows we could use some romance
In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything
But there are just so many summers, babe
And just so many springs

[Chorus 2]
And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, baby
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance
To show you love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

That you'll have to spend

Making up for lost time

Coming from the body heat
Steamy windows
Ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows

It's funny that way
You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh father, I have sinned

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?

Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

I got away from you

You can't make me cry

442,Don't Shut Me Out,"[Intro]
Don't shut me out maybe baby
We should talk about it
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby
They might be unfounded

[Verse 1]
Have a little faith you'll make it through
I'd never hesitate to talk to you
If you tell me just what's weighing on your mind
Maybe it could help you sleep tonight
So don't shut me out

[Verse 2]
Don't be so proud don't ya know that
Before a fall it leaves ya
And it'll take you down baby that ain't
Where I wanna see ya

[Verse 3]
The sun'll rise tomorrow come what may
And you'll feel better than you do today
And in time you'll cry no more
I know 'cause my heart's been there before

[Chorus]
And here I am when you need someone
My shoulder's yours to cry upon
And everybody now and then
Needs and understanding friend around
So don't shut me out

[Verse 4]
Don't shut me out maybe baby
We should talk about it
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby
They might be unfounded
Listen to your heart and clear your mind
And you will find the answer every time
Every road you travel on will lead
To where it is your heart's supposed to be

[Chorus]
And here I am when you need someone
My shoulder is yours to cry upon
And everybody now and then
Needs an understanding' friend around

444,Leave A Light On,"[Verse 1]
The second someone mentioned you were all alone
I could feel the trouble coursin' through your veins
Now I know it's got a hold
Just a phone call left unanswered had me sparkin' up
These cigarettes won't stop me wonderin' where you are
Don't let go, keep a hold

[Pre-Chorus]
If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
To a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way

[Chorus]
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on

[Verse 2]
Tell me what's been happenin', what's been on your mind
Lately, you've been searchin' for a darker place to hide
That's alright
But if you carry on abusing, you'll be robbed from us
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs
Just come home, don't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
To a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way

[Chorus]
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on

[Bridge]
If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
It's a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
And if you've lost your way, if you've lost your way
I will leave the light on
And I know you're down and out now, but I need you to be brave
Hidin' from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay
I see your pain
If you don't feel our grace and you've lost your way

[Outro]
Well, I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
'Cause I will leave the light on",Tom Walker,1990,"[96, 84, 64, 55]",4

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one
Savage, I ain't even hatin'""
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage, I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 2]
So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga, my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know, they bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

[Chorus]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?

447,Hide Your Heart,"[Verse 1]
Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire
His fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito, he was king of the streets
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown
Johnny better run, better run

[Chorus]
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire

[Verse]
The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone
It was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run, better run

[Chorus]

Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night
As time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming 'til he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill
A shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands
With nothing won
When someone lies dying
Lovers finally understand

Orion's arms are wide enough
To hold us both together
Although we're worlds apart
I'd cross the stars for you
In the heart of a sleepless moon
I'll be with you forever
This is my destiny
'Till my life is through

[Chorus: Prince & Sheena Easton]
The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

[Verse 2: Prince and Sheena Easton]
When I am lost and feeling alone
I just look to heaven
I find my comfort there
God only knows where you are tonight
God only knows where you are tonight
Maybe time will tell me
'Till then I'll close my eyes and say a prayer for you
I'll say a prayer for you too

[Chorus: Prince & Sheena Easton]
The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

[Bridge: Prince & Sheena Easton]
Orion's heart is bright enough
To shine on both of us
The constellations never fail
To light the way for love

[Verse 1 Variation: Prince and Sheena Easton]
Orion's arms are wide enough
To hold us both together
Although we're worlds apart
I'd cross the stars for you
I'd cross the stars for you

The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear
The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

[Outro: Prince & Sheena Easton]
The arms of Orion
The arms of Orion
That's where I want to be
The arms of Orion
Since you've been gone
I've been drowning
Drowning
Drowning without your love

449,I Live By The Groove,"Hey

Everybody loves to feel the beat
From Malibu to 42nd Street

I like to groove
No matter where I am
From Detroit City down to Alabam

It has moved me heart and soul
So I do believe
It's a whole philosophy to me

I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose

A good groove will
Turn your head around
Lifts you up
When you're feeling down

Get your body moving into gear
That's why the world's
Been turning all these years

It ain't written
In the statute books
It can't be learned in school
It's the law, baby
It's the golden rule

I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose

Said I live by the groove
I live by, live by
Live by, live by the groove

""Admit if, you bit it, bit it""

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a Hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

[Hook]
Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

""Admit it, you bit it"" - G. Dep
""Tell these niggas somethin' God"" - Ghostface Killah

What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike

You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go

452,Lullaby,"[Intro]
I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

[Verse 1]
On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

[Bridge]
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart

I'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash on 'em, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

[Chorus: Roxette]

So scared that life's gonna pass you by
Your spirit dying
Not long ago
I could feel your strength
And your devotion
What was so clear is now overcast
With mixed emotions
Deep in your heart is the answer
Find it
I know it will pull you through

[Chorus]
Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action

[Verse 2]
I think it's true that we've all been through
Some nasty weather
Let's understand that we're here to
Handle things together
You gotta keep looking onto tomorrow
There's so much in life
That's meant for you

[Chorus]
Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action
Get on your feet
Don't stop before it's over
Get on your feet
The weight is off your shoulder
Get up and make it happen
Stand up, stand up, stand up
And take some action
Gotta get on your feet, yeah, yeah
Don't stop before it's over
Get on your feet
The weight is off your shoulder
Get on your feet
Get up
Get up, get up
And make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up
Stand up
And take some action
Get on your feet",Gloria Estefan,1990,"[99, 81, 80]",3

I don't want it unless I know
That each passing hour
Someone somehow
Will be there, ready to share...

I need a love that's strong

Of the fool again
Before I begin

Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore

Feeling that feeling again
I'm playing a game I can't win
Love's knocking on the door
Of my heart once more
Think I'll let her in
Before I begin

Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore

Foolish heart...
Foolish, foolish heart

You've been wrong before

Alone, I'm searching for devotion
In a faded melody
My soul is trying to cross an ocean
Down on bended knee
Lock up my cadence and rhyme
Don't know what I'm trying to say
My heart, all the time was stolen by bad poetry

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Verse 2]
I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open
Love's insanity
So long, words are left unspoken
I couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
My heart, I'm left with a broken vocabulary

[Bridge]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself

Snow named Gidget

With a cute little midget
Nothing made my heart sing
Nothing seemed to last
The future looked dim
Just like the past
But surprise from the sky
Came a dream called you
No one's ever rocked me
Like the way that you do
It hurts so good
When you do what you do
You're the end of the line
I wanna spend my life with you
Whitney Houston
Madonna
And even Brooke Shields
Don't come close to you
The real deal

I hope I can hang

And we'll do the wild thang",Chunky A,1990,[100],1
