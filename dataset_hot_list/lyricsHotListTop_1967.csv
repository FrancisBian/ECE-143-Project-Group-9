0,Hello Goodbye,"[Verse 1: Erik Segerstedt]
Hello, goodbye, you were perfect
But now that the sun's coming out we're through
Your body and mine, empty bottles of wine
And the memories are chasing clues

Let's not make things complicated
We're better off seperated

[Chorus 1: Erik Segerstedt]
'Cause now we're sober, it's all over
Don't push your luck and ask if you could stay
There's nothing more I need, just go away
Just go away

[Verse 2: Tone Damli]
Hello, goodbye, you were perfect last night
But this bed isn't made for two
You said please stay the night, I could be mr. right
For a second that line felt true

Let's not make things complicated
We're better off seperated

[Chorus 2: Tone Damli]
'Cause now we're sober, it's all over
And nothing that you say will sound okay
I'll pack my things there ain't no other way
Now we're sober, don't come closer
Don't push your luck and ask if I could stay
There's nothing more I need, I'll go away

[Bridge: Both]
We could do this all again
We should enjoy it while we can
Call me whenever you feel alone
And I will take you home
But then you're on your own, 'cause

Hello goodbye, you were perfect
But now that the sun's coming out we're through

[Chorus 3: Both]
Now we're sober, it's all over
'Cause every now and then I need to play
With you the game gets better every day
Now we're sober, don't come closer
'Cause nothing that we say will sound okay
Hello, goodbye, we'll go out seperate ways
Our seperate ways",Tone Damli,1967,"[1, 3, 3, 8, 45]",5

3,I Second That Emotion,"[Verse 1]
Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all

[Hook]
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

[Verse 2]
Maybe you think that love would tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
So it makes you wise to break the rules

[Hook]
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part

I know you don't want this, neither do we
But sometimes things happen that we can't foresee
Now try to be calm kids, and don't look so sad
Just cause I am leaving, I'll still be your dad
Just remember I love you though I'm not here
Just call if you need me and I'll always be near

Say your prayers before you go to bed

30,The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener,"Life is never what it seems
We're always searching in our dreams
To find that little castle in the air
When worry starts to cloud the mind
It's hard to leave it all behind
And just pretend you haven't got a care

There's someone else in your imagination
You wish that you were standing in their shoes
You'd change your life without much hesitation
But would you if you really had to choose?

So, don't look around
Get your feet on the ground
It's much better by far
To be just who you are

The other man's grass is always greener
The sun shines brighter on the other side
The other man's grass is always greener
Some are lucky, some are not
But just be thankful for what you've got

Many times, it seems to me
There's someone else I'd rather be
Living in a world of make-believe
To stay in bed 'til nearly three
With nothing there to worry me
Would seem to be the life I might achieve

But deep inside, I know I'm really lucky
With happiness I've never known before
And just as long as you are there beside me
I know that I could ask for nothing more

Then living can start
With the love in your heart
So, with you all the time
All the treasures I've longed for are mine

The other man's grass is always greener
The sun shines brighter on the other side
The other man's grass is always greener
Some are lucky, some are not
But I'm so thankful for what I've got

The other man's grass is always greener
The sun shines brighter on the other side
The other man's grass is always greener
Some are lucky, some are not
But I'm so thankful for what I've got",Petula Clark,1967,"[31, 41, 52, 62, 77]",5

I can show the world, ma'

By the time I get to Phoenix, he'll be rising

Because I've left that man so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque he'll be working
He'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But he'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma he'll be sleeping
He'll turn softly and call my name out low
And he'll cry just to think I'd really leave him
Though time and time I've tried to tell him so

I think, therefore I am fresh, stand next to the next man
And can bless fans, decks and mics
Come correct like I was right, but when I write sometimes I'm wrong
So I confess over beats I rock on
And rock on like gravel even though I've got it locked like lock stock and barrel
God still watches the sparrow from the deep down to the shallow
Blaze mics like I'm John Wayne plain blazing the saddle
Must break straighter than an arrow to uprock on the narrow
Apparel, sack and ashes, but deserve 10,000 lashes from 10,000 fascists for my sins
To burn like 10,000 matches enter into my world
Where I do what I hate and the man I want to be escapes me
And I wonder to myself, was God tripping when He made me?
Am I off or am I crazy? Am I lost or am I lazy?
Days from where I keep him, I'm falling off the deep end
I'm looking for the weekend to slow down and try to keep ends
Meeting but the gap is 10 feet, I want to dine where the richest men eat
I can't stand it, where's my seat?
At least, well, in the least I'm not marked by the beast
I'm waiting for the Son to rise, but I'm not looking to the east
Instead I'm looking to the feast, the last supper, rooms of upper
Upper levels, clear of devils, place where I'll forever settle
Heart is heavier than metal for the lost souls tossed
Hard rocks scared of being soft, they'll burn like molotovs
A Holocaust, they can't see the cost paid, the cascade
They can't see who's the boss, they can't see the last days
On and off the track plays, drowned out by gat sprays
So I look to the sky and wonder, what would Dad say?
I look to the sky and wonder what would Dad say?
I look to the sky and pray, what does Dad say?

[Hook: repeat 2X]
From the caverns of the mind, we wander on and stumble blind
Wade through the tangled maze of starless nights and sunless days
Looking for some kind of a clue for what to do
Hoping for the road to lead us to the truth",Mars ILL,1967,"[36, 51, 74]",3

38,To Sir With Love,"Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
""To Sir, with love""

The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love",Lulu,1967,"[39, 21, 13, 6, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 11, 22, 35, 58, 74]",17

For, stayin at my side was more than what I, sent you through

The last thing I would do, honey, just to let you know
If I lose you now, I don't think I could make it

To let my love miss out the happiness
That you're all about, I said that you
Showed me how to be happy, said you
Showed me how to be happy, baby

Have nobody for my own

You make my friends grow lighter and lighter

Anyplace is all right long as I'm with you
In a faraway land by the trophic sea sand if your hand's in my hand I won't be blue
Way up on the mountain a way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy anyplace anywhere I don't care
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
Anyplace is all right long as you are there

I could be happy in one little room with only a table and a chair
As happy as I'd be in a kingdom by the sea darling if you were there
And I could be rich or I could be poor in fact if you were by my side
I could be anything in the whole wide world and I know I'd be satisfied

51,Dancing Bear,"I wouldn't want to be a chimney sweep
All black from head to foot
From climbing in them chimneys
And cleaning out that soot

With a broom and ladder and nail
The darkened walls I scale
And far..and high..
I see a patch of sky

I'd rather be the gypsy
Who's camped at the edge of town
The one who has the dancing bear
That follows him around

And he lifts his big foot up
Puts his big foot down
Then bows..then twirls..
Then dances round and round

I found I was a cabin boy
Last night as I did dream
Bound aboard a magic ship
For a land I'd never seen

And the moon she filled our sails
And the stars they steered our course
And on..our bow..
There was a golden horse

The queen eats fruit and candy
The bishop nuts and cheese
And when I am a grown man
I'll taste just what i please

The honey from the bee
The shellfish from the sea
The earth, the wind, a girl
Someone to share these things with me

I wouldn't want to be a chimney sweep
All black from head to foot
From climbing in them chimneys
And cleaning out that soot

I'd rather be the gypsy

Guess I could find somebody new
But I don't wan't no one but you
How can you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?

Before you leave be sure you find
You want his love much more than mine
'Cause I'll just say we've never met
If I'm that easy to forget

They say you've found somebody new
But that won't stop my loving you
How could you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?

Guess I could find somebody new
But I don't wan't no one but you

We are, we are, we are

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

[Verse 2: Khalid]
L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves

55,Two Little Kids,"Two invitations came to my address
They must have mailed them before you left
The wedding of our closest friends
Read like a guarantee i'd see you again

I took a seat across the aisle
They gave us separate tables on opposite sides
A few drinks deep i stepped outside
Only to look up and meet your eyes

You were sweating through your dress
You said: ""why do people get married in july?""
You shared your cigarettes
We lit a hundred at a time
""what was that verse they read?""
Yeah, ""love is patient, love is kind...""
Couldn't be a safer bet
But it feels truer every time
Even if it's a lie
There will be a time
To speak our minds
Just not tonight

Just when it seemed like we were getting along
They took requests, they played that song
Felt like the lord was trying do us in
I held your hair back while you got sick

""don't get it on your dress""
""why do people get married all the time?""
You'd share your cigarettes
If we could only find a light
""what was that verse they read again?""
Yeah, ""love is patient, love is kind....""
Couldn't be a safer bet

Why can't we be like Storybook Children?

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died
Everybody talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long-stem rose
Everybody knows

[Verse 3]
Everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Oh, give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
Everybody knows

[Chorus]
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

[Verse 4]
And everybody knows that it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
And everybody knows that you live forever
When you've done a line or two
Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old Black Joe's still picking cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows

[Verse 5]
And everybody knows that the plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows

[Verse 6]
And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
Before it blows
Everybody knows",Sigrid,1967,"[60, 70, 86]",3
59,Watch Her Ride,"I didn't know you were the one for me
I couldn't see but you were waiting
For someone to come along
To help you out to sing your song
And I was changing
All I see is you
All I feel is you for me

And I would really like to watch you ride
And always feel you by my side
I would really like to watch you ride
All on me

I go stumbling to the sky
And I seem to fly so high
I see you
I feel you
You have a way of walking 'round
Your feet they never touch the ground
And you are shining
All I see is you
All I feel is you for me

Times don't change
Times don't ever change for me
And I know that you could be
The only thing in my world
The only thing that my mind would find for love
For love and peace of mind
For me
For me
Yeaooooh oh oh oh oh oooooh

Your Shadow in the morning sun becomes my fun
And we can say ""I love you, I love you""
My morning shines on silver beaches
Your light flashes to the reaches
Of my mind, of my mind, of my mind
And my mind it comes alive with you
It's all that I can do
To sit here and let you blow my mind
Oh my mind
You're so fine
In my mind
You're so fine

61,Darlin',"[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yeah, look
If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
‘Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, ‘cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So b-b-b-b-b-b, but I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: ""Come nearer!""

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

""Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here!
Talk to me, sit! Here, pull up a chair!
Why don't you cut your hair?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dye it back, come on, try it!""
Ahh, no! I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
""But I'm here to rebuild you,"" — but I already killed you!
""But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother,"" — yeah, so what of her?
""You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes,"" — fuck you, motherfucker!
I had you beat! — ""No, I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm taking it back,"" — you fuckin' bitch, why?!
""Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? Ha-ha-ha-ha!""

You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling

I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
""Shady, listen! (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back!""
But I don't want it back — ""Yes, you do,"" — no, I don't
""Yes, you do! You're gonna regret it later,"" — no, I won't
""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor""
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
""Well, I got him on the phone right now!""
(Slim!) You're lying! (Yo, Slim!) How, why now?
What up, Dre? (Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all that Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up) — fuck this mirror!
""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you,"" — fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch!
""Put the gun down!"" — bye-bye! Boom!
Okay, I'm still alive, — ""So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle

Oh, listen to the children while they play
Now ain't it kind of funny what the children say?
Skip a rope

Stab 'em in the back that's the name of the game
And mommy, and daddy, are who's to blame

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Just listen to your children while they play
It's really, not, very funny, what the children say
Skip a rope
Skip a rope
Skip a rope
Skip a rope",Henson Cargill,1967,"[68, 83]",2
67,The Lesson,"[Verse 1]
""It's best to not breathe in at all,""
Your teachers say
""The toxins in the air will take your life away""
But don't believe a word from them
You'll be okay
For I will breathe with you

[Verse 2]
You can't afford to show your face and smile back
The spark of a new love can cause a heart attack
So leave me here to smile
Until my teeth turn black
And I won't grieve for you

[Chorus]
And in the coming years
We all will disappear
Into the clouds that the rain falls from
And if we make believe
Our bodies create the seas
We'll feel less worrisome

[Verse 3]
I can't pretend to know why some die by the sword
Was taught when I was young
One day I'd meet the Lord
But sitting here in class
That talk just makes me bored
While others nod their heads

[Verse 4]
I've always felt this distance I could not explain
I've chalked it up as something wrong inside my brain
But maybe we're all lost
Since we all bleed the same
Remember what I said

[Chorus]
That in the coming years
We all will disappear
Into the clouds that the rain falls from
And if we make believe
Our bodies create the seas
We'll feel less worrisome",The Lemon Twigs,1967,"[69, 84]",2
68,Spooky,"[Verse 1]
See my face when I slide through
Every place I will find you
Every time we fell apart
Girl I see it in the scars
Baby hold my hand, let me be your man
Let me take you away from the cold
Baby be my diamonds and gold
Wander through the dead with you caught up in my head
Thinkin' I'ma flip and fill my brain with lead
I'ma end my life without you
Baby let's just see what these clouds do
I'm not so perfect baby yeah you worth it
Come right here, hey
Girl let me see you work it
Now we closin' curtains, come right here

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Don't you know you're so sexy
The way you move your body up and down
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are
But you're no where to be found, hey
I tried to protect you
From my hands you left
You broke my heart right there, all I do is stare
No you'll never fuckin care, hey
I thought you were different
Telling me what is and I was wrong
I never thought of you as ig'nant
Now I'm gettin' lifted, you're in my soul
Baby I'm about to die
Baby wanna watch me die
Baby don't you wanna know why
Didn't even try

69,Hooray For The Salvation Army Band,"The yard of the West Ham shelter of the Salvation Army is a cold place on a January morning. The building itself, an old warehouse, is newly whitewashed. Its gabled end projects into the yard in the middle, with a door on the ground floor, and another in the loft above it without any balcony or ladder, but with a pulley rigged over it for hoisting sacks. Those who come from this central gable end into the yard have the gateway leading to the street on their left, with a stone horse-trough just beyond it, and, on the right, a penthouse shielding a table from the weather. There are forms at the table; and on them are seated a man and a woman, both much down on their luck, finishing a meal of bread [one thick slice each, with margarine and golden syrup] and diluted milk.

The man, a workman out of employment, is young, agile, a talker, a poser, sharp enough to be capable of anything in reason except honesty or altruistic considerations of any kind. The woman is a commonplace old bundle of poverty and hard-worn humanity. She looks sixty and probably is forty-five. If they were rich people, gloved and muffed and well wrapped up in furs and overcoats, they would be numbed and miserable; for it is a grindingly cold, raw, January day; and a glance at the background of grimy warehouses and leaden sky visible over the whitewashed walls of the yard would drive any idle rich person straight to the Mediterranean. But these two, being no more troubled with visions of the Mediterranean than of the moon, and being compelled to keep more of their clothes in the pawnshop, and less on their persons, in winter than in summer, are not depressed by the cold: rather are they stung into vivacity, to which their meal has just now given an almost jolly turn. The man takes a pull at his mug, and then gets up and moves about the yard with his hands deep in his pockets, occasionally breaking into a stepdance.

THE WOMAN
Feel better otter your meal, sir?

THE MAN
No. Call that a meal! Good enough for you, props; but wot is it to me, an intelligent workin man.

THE WOMAN
Workin man! Wot are you?

THE MAN
Painter.

THE WOMAN
[sceptically] Yus, I dessay.

THE MAN
Yus, you dessay! I know. Every loafer that can't do nothink calls isself a painter. Well, I'm a real painter: grainer, finisher, thirty-eight bob a week when I can get it.

THE WOMAN
Then why don't you go and get it?

THE MAN
I'll tell you why. Fust: I'm intelligent--fffff! it's rotten cold here [he dances a step or two]--yes: intelligent beyond the station o life into which it has pleased the capitalists to call me; and they don't like a man that sees through em. Second, an intelligent bein needs a doo share of appiness; so I drink somethink cruel when I get the chawnce. Third, I stand by my class and do as little as I can so's to leave arf the job for me fellow workers. Fourth, I'm fly enough to know wots inside the law and wots outside it; and inside it I do as the capitalists do: pinch wot I can lay me ands on. In a proper state of society I am sober, industrious and honest: in Rome, so to speak, I do as the Romans do. Wots the consequence? When trade is bad--and it's rotten bad just now--and the employers az to sack arf their men, they generally start on me.

THE WOMAN
What's your name?

THE MAN
Price. Bronterre O'Brien Price. Usually called Snobby Price, for short.

THE WOMAN
Snobby's a carpenter, ain't it? You said you was a painter.

PRICE
Not that kind of snob, but the genteel sort. I'm too uppish, owing to my intelligence, and my father being a Chartist and a reading, thinking man: a stationer, too. I'm none of your common hewers of wood and drawers of water; and don't you forget it. [He returns to his seat at the table, and takes up his mug]. Wots YOUR name?

THE WOMAN
Rummy Mitchens, sir.

PRICE
[quaffing the remains of his milk to her] Your elth, Miss Mitchens.

RUMMY
[correcting him] Missis Mitchens.

PRICE
Wot! Oh Rummy, Rummy! Respectable married woman, Rummy, gittin rescued by the Salvation Army by pretendin to be a bad un. Same old game!

RUMMY
What am I to do? I can't starve. Them Salvation lasses is dear good girls; but the better you are, the worse they likes to think you were before they rescued you. Why shouldn't they av a bit o credit, poor loves? They're worn to rags by their work. And where would they get the money to rescue us if we was to let on we're no worse than other people? You know what ladies and gentlemen are.

PRICE
Thievin swine! Wish I ad their job, Rummy, all the same. Wot does Rummy stand for? Pet name props?

RUMMY
Short for Romola.

PRICE
For wot!?

RUMMY
Romola. It was out of a new book. Somebody me mother wanted me to grow up like.

PRICE
We're companions in misfortune, Rummy. Both on us got names that nobody cawnt pronounce. Consequently I'm Snobby and you're Rummy because Bill and Sally wasn't good enough for our parents. Such is life!

RUMMY
Who saved you, Mr. Price? Was it Major Barbara?

PRICE
No: I come here on my own. I'm goin to be Bronterre O'Brien Price, the converted painter. I know wot they like. I'll tell em how I blasphemed and gambled and wopped my poor old mother--

RUMMY
[shocked] Used you to beat your mother?

PRICE
Not likely. She used to beat me. No matter: you come and listen to the converted painter, and you'll hear how she was a pious woman that taught me me prayers at er knee, an how I used to come home drunk and drag her out o bed be er snow white airs, an lam into er with the poker.

RUMMY
That's what's so unfair to us women. Your confessions is just as big lies as ours: you don't tell what you really done no more than us; but you men can tell your lies right out at the meetins and be made much of for it; while the sort o confessions we az to make az to be wispered to one lady at a time. It ain't right, spite of all their piety.

PRICE
Right! Do you spose the Army'd be allowed if it went and did right? Not much. It combs our air and makes us good little blokes to be robbed and put upon. But I'll play the game as good as any of em. I'll see somebody struck by lightnin, or hear a voice sayin ""Snobby Price: where will you spend eternity?"" I'll ave a time of it, I tell you.

RUMMY
You won't be let drink, though.

PRICE
I'll take it out in gorspellin, then. I don't want to drink if I can get fun enough any other way.
Jenny Hill, a pale, overwrought, pretty Salvation lass of 18, comes in through the yard gate, leading Peter Shirley, a half hardened, half worn-out elderly man, weak with hunger.

JENNY
[supporting him] Come! pluck up. I'll get you something to eat. You'll be all right then.

PRICE
[rising and hurrying officiously to take the old man off Jenny's hands] Poor old man! Cheer up, brother: you'll find rest and peace and appiness ere. Hurry up with the food, miss: e's fair done. [Jenny hurries into the shelter]. Ere, buck up, daddy! She's fetchin y'a thick slice o breadn treacle, an a mug o skyblue. [He seats him at the corner of the table].

RUMMY
[gaily] Keep up your old art! Never say die!

SHIRLEY
I'm not an old man. I'm ony 46. I'm as good as ever I was. The grey patch come in my hair before I was thirty. All it wants is three pennorth o hair dye: am I to be turned on the streets to starve for it? Holy God! I've worked ten to twelve hours a day since I was thirteen, and paid my way all through; and now am I to be thrown into the gutter and my job given to a young man that can do it no better than me because I've black hair that goes white at the first change?

PRICE
[cheerfully] No good jawrin about it. You're ony a jumped-up, jerked-off, orspittle-turned-out incurable of an ole workin man: who cares about you? Eh? Make the thievin swine give you a meal: they've stole many a one from you. Get a bit o your own back. [Jenny returns with the usual meal]. There you are, brother. Awsk a blessin an tuck that into you.

SHIRLEY
[looking at it ravenously but not touching it, and crying like a child] I never took anything before.

JENNY
[petting him] Come, come! the Lord sends it to you: he wasn't above taking bread from his friends; and why should you be? Besides, when we find you a job you can pay us for it if you like.

SHIRLEY
[eagerly] Yes, yes: that's true. I can pay you back: it's only a loan. [Shivering] Oh Lord! oh Lord! [He turns to the table and attacks the meal ravenously].

JENNY
Well, Rummy, are you more comfortable now?

RUMMY
God bless you, lovey! You've fed my body and saved my soul, haven't you? [Jenny, touched, kisses her] Sit down and rest a bit: you must be ready to drop.

JENNY
I've been going hard since morning. But there's more work than we can do. I mustn't stop.

RUMMY
Try a prayer for just two minutes. You'll work all the better after.

JENNY
[her eyes lighting up] Oh isn't it wonderful how a few minutes prayer revives you! I was quite lightheaded at twelve o'clock, I was so tired; but Major Barbara just sent me to pray for five minutes; and I was able to go on as if I had only just begun. [To Price] Did you have a piece of bread?

PAIGE
[with unction] Yes, miss; but I've got the piece that I value more; and that's the peace that passeth hall hannerstennin.
RUMMY [fervently] Glory Hallelujah!

Bill Walker, a rough customer of about 25, appears at the yard gate and looks malevolently at Jenny.

JENNY
That makes me so happy. When you say that, I feel wicked for loitering here. I must get to work again.
She is hurrying to the shelter, when the new-comer moves quickly up to the door and intercepts her. His manner is so threatening that she retreats as he comes at her truculently, driving her down the yard.

BILL
I know you. You're the one that took away my girl. You're the one that set er agen me. Well, I'm goin to av er out. Not that I care a curse for her or you: see? But I'll let er know; and I'll let you know. I'm goin to give er a doin that'll teach er to cut away from me. Now in with you and tell er to come out afore I come in and kick er out. Tell er Bill Walker wants er. She'll know what that means; and if she keeps me waitin it'll be worse. You stop to jaw back at me; and I'll start on you: d'ye hear? There's your way. In you go. [He takes her by the arm and slings her towards the door of the shelter. She falls on her hand and knee. Rummy helps her up again].

PRICE
[rising, and venturing irresolutely towards Bill]. Easy there, mate. She ain't doin you no arm.

BILL
Who are you callin mate? [Standing over him threateningly]. You're goin to stand up for her, are you? Put up your ands.

RUMMY
[running indignantly to him to scold him]. Oh, you great brute-- [He instantly swings his left hand back against her face. She screams and reels back to the trough, where she sits down, covering her bruised face with her hands and rocking and moaning with pain].

JENNY
[going to her]. Oh God forgive you! How could you strike an old woman like that?

BILL
[seizing her by the hair so violently that she also screams, and tearing her away from the old woman]. You Gawd forgive me again and I'll Gawd forgive you one on the jaw that'll stop you prayin for a week. [Holding her and turning fiercely on Price]. Av you anything to say agen it? Eh?

PRICE
[intimidated]. No, matey: she ain't anything to do with me.

BILL
Good job for you! I'd put two meals into you and fight you with one finger after, you starved cur. [To Jenny] Now are you goin to fetch out Mog Habbijam; or am I to knock your face off you and fetch her myself?

JENNY
[writhing in his grasp] Oh please someone go in and tell Major Barbara--[she screams again as he wrenches her head down; and Price and Rummy, flee into the shelter].

BILL
You want to go in and tell your Major of me, do you?

JENNY
Oh please don't drag my hair. Let me go.

BILL
Do you or don't you? [She stifles a scream]. Yes or no.

JENNY
God give me strength--

BILL
[striking her with his fist in the face] Go and show her that, and tell her if she wants one like it to come and interfere with me. [Jenny, crying with pain, goes into the shed. He goes to the form and addresses the old man]. Here: finish your mess; and get out o my way.

SHIRLEY
[springing up and facing him fiercely, with the mug in his hand] You take a liberty with me, and I'll smash you over the face with the mug and cut your eye out. Ain't you satisfied--young whelps like you--with takin the bread out o the mouths of your elders that have brought you up and slaved for you, but you must come shovin and cheekin and bullyin in here, where the bread o charity is sickenin in our stummicks?

BILL
[contemptuously, but backing a little] Wot good are you, you old palsy mug? Wot good are you?

SHIRLEY
As good as you and better. I'll do a day's work agen you or any fat young soaker of your age. Go and take my job at Horrockses, where I worked for ten year. They want young men there: they can't afford to keep men over forty-five. They're very sorry--give you a character and happy to help you to get anything suited to your years--sure a steady man won't be long out of a job. Well, let em try you. They'll find the differ. What do you know? Not as much as how to beeyave yourself--layin your dirty fist across the mouth of a respectable woman!

BILL
Don't provoke me to lay it acrost yours: d'ye hear?

SHIRLEY
[with blighting contempt] Yes: you like an old man to hit, don't you, when you've finished with the women. I ain't seen you hit a young one yet.

BILL
[stung] You lie, you old soupkitchener, you. There was a young man here. Did I offer to hit him or did I not?

SHIRLEY
Was he starvin or was he not? Was he a man or only a crosseyed thief an a loafer? Would you hit my son-in-law's brother?

BILL
Who's he?

SHIRLEY
Todger Fairmile o Balls Pond. Him that won 20 pounds off the Japanese wrastler at the music hall by standin out 17 minutes 4 seconds agen him.

BILL
[sullenly] I'm no music hall wrastler. Can he box?

SHIRLEY
Yes: an you can't.

BILL
Wot! I can't, can't I? Wot's that you say [threatening him]?

SHIRLEY
[not budging an inch] Will you box Todger Fairmile if I put him on to you? Say the word.

BILL
[subsiding with a slouch] I'll stand up to any man alive, if he was ten Todger Fairmiles. But I don't set up to be a perfessional.

SHIRLEY
[looking down on him with unfathomable disdain] YOU box! Slap an old woman with the back o your hand! You hadn't even the sense to hit her where a magistrate couldn't see the mark of it, you silly young lump of conceit and ignorance. Hit a girl in the jaw and ony make her cry! If Todger Fairmile'd done it, she wouldn't a got up inside o ten minutes, no more than you would if he got on to you. Yah! I'd set about you myself if I had a week's feedin in me instead o two months starvation. [He returns to the table to finish his meal].

BILL
[following him and stooping over him to drive the taunt in] You lie! you have the bread and treacle in you that you come here to beg.

SHIRLEY
[bursting into tears] Oh God! it's true: I'm only an old pauper on the scrap heap. [Furiously] But you'll come to it yourself; and then you'll know. You'll come to it sooner than a teetotaller like me, fillin yourself with gin at this hour o the mornin!

BILL
I'm no gin drinker, you old liar; but when I want to give my girl a bloomin good idin I like to av a bit o devil in me: see? An here I am, talkin to a rotten old blighter like you sted o givin her wot for. [Working himself into a rage] I'm goin in there to fetch her out. [He makes vengefully for the shelter door].

SHIRLEY
You're goin to the station on a stretcher, more likely; and they'll take the gin and the devil out of you there when they get you inside. You mind what you're about: the major here is the Earl o Stevenage's granddaughter.

BILL
[checked] Garn!

SHIRLEY
You'll see.

BILL
[his resolution oozing] Well, I ain't done nothin to er.

SHIRLEY
Spose she said you did! who'd believe you?

BILL
[very uneasy, skulking back to the corner of the penthouse] Gawd! There's no jastice in this country. To think wot them people can do! I'm as good as er.

SHIRLEY
Tell her so. It's just what a fool like you would do.

Barbara, brisk and businesslike, comes from the shelter with a note book, and addresses herself to Shirley. Bill, cowed, sits down in the corner on a form, and turns his back on them.

BARBARA
Good morning.

SHIRLEY
[standing up and taking off his hat] Good morning, miss.

BARBARA
Sit down: make yourself at home. [He hesitates; but she puts a friendly hand on his shoulder and makes him obey]. Now then! since you've made friends with us, we want to know all about you. Names and addresses and trades.

SHIRLEY
Peter Shirley. Fitter. Chucked out two months ago because I was too old.

BARBARA
[not at all surprised] You'd pass still. Why didn't you dye your hair?

SHIRLEY
I did. Me age come out at a coroner's inquest on me daughter.

BARBARA
Steady?

SHIRLEY
Teetotaller. Never out of a job before. Good worker. And sent to the knockers like an old horse!

BARBARA
No matter: if you did your part God will do his.

SHIRLEY
[suddenly stubborn] My religion's no concern of anybody but myself.

BARBARA
[guessing] I know. Secularist?

SHIRLEY
[hotly] Did I offer to deny it?

BARBARA
Why should you? My own father's a Secularist, I think. Our Father--yours and mine--fulfils himself in many ways; and I daresay he knew what he was about when he made a Secularist of you. So buck up, Peter! we can always find a job for a steady man like you. [Shirley, disarmed, touches his hat. She turns from him to Bill]. What's your name?

BILL
[insolently] Wot's that to you?

BARBARA
[calmly making a note] Afraid to give his name. Any trade?

BILL
Who's afraid to give his name? [Doggedly, with a sense of heroically defying the House of Lords in the person of Lord Stevenage] If you want to bring a charge agen me, bring it. [She waits, unruffled]. My name's Bill Walker.

BARBARA
[as if the name were familiar: trying to remember how] Bill Walker? [Recollecting] Oh, I know: you're the man that Jenny Hill was praying for inside just now. [She enters his name in her note book].

BILL
Who's Jenny Hill? And what call has she to pray for me?

BARBARA
I don't know. Perhaps it was you that cut her lip.

BILL
[defiantly] Yes, it was me that cut her lip. I ain't afraid o you.

BARBARA
How could you be, since you're not afraid of God? You're a brave man, Mr. Walker. It takes some pluck to do our work here; but none of us dare lift our hand against a girl like that, for fear of her father in heaven.

BILL
[sullenly] I want none o your cantin jaw. I suppose you think I come here to beg from you, like this damaged lot here. Not me. I don't want your bread and scrape and catlap. I don't believe in your Gawd, no more than you do yourself.

BARBARA
[sunnily apologetic and ladylike, as on a new footing with him] Oh, I beg your pardon for putting your name down, Mr. Walker. I didn't understand. I'll strike it out.

BILL
[taking this as a slight, and deeply wounded by it] Eah! you let my name alone. Ain't it good enough to be in your book?

BARBARA
[considering] Well, you see, there's no use putting down your name unless I can do something for you, is there? What's your trade?

BILL
[still smarting] That's no concern o yours.

BARBARA
Just so. [very businesslike] I'll put you down as [writing] the man who--struck--poor little Jenny Hill--in the mouth.
BILL [rising threateningly] See here. I've ad enough o this.

BARBARA
[quite sunny and fearless] What did you come to us for?

BILL
I come for my girl, see? I come to take her out o this and to break er jaws for her.

BARBARA
[complacently] You see I was right about your trade. [Bill, on the point of retorting furiously, finds himself, to his great shame and terror, in danger of crying instead. He sits down again suddenly]. What's her name?

BILL
[dogged] Er name's Mog Abbijam: thats wot her name is.

BARBARA
Oh, she's gone to Canning Town, to our barracks there.

BILL
[fortified by his resentment of Mog's perfidy] is she? [Vindictively] Then I'm goin to Kennintahn arter her. [He crosses to the gate; hesitates; finally comes back at Barbara]. Are you lyin to me to get shut o me?

BARBARA
I don't want to get shut of you. I want to keep you here and save your soul. You'd better stay: you're going to have a bad time today, Bill.

BILL
Who's goin to give it to me? You, props.

BARBARA
Someone you don't believe in. But you'll be glad afterwards.

BILL
[slinking off] I'll go to Kennintahn to be out o the reach o your tongue. [Suddenly turning on her with intense malice] And if I don't find Mog there, I'll come back and do two years for you, selp me Gawd if I don't!

BARBARA
[a shade kindlier, if possible] It's no use, Bill. She's got another bloke.

BILL
Wot!

BARBARA
One of her own converts. He fell in love with her when he saw her with her soul saved, and her face clean, and her hair washed.

BILL
[surprised] Wottud she wash it for, the carroty slut? It's red.

BARBARA
It's quite lovely now, because she wears a new look in her eyes with it. It's a pity you're too late. The new bloke has put your nose out of joint, Bill.

BILL
I'll put his nose out o joint for him. Not that I care a curse for her, mind that. But I'll teach her to drop me as if I was dirt. And I'll teach him to meddle with my Judy. Wots iz bleedin name?

BARBARA
Sergeant Todger Fairmile.

SHIRLEY
[rising with grim joy] I'll go with him, miss. I want to see them two meet. I'll take him to the infirmary when it's over.

BILL
[to Shirley, with undissembled misgiving] Is that im you was speakin on?

SHIRLEY
That's him.

BILL
Im that wrastled in the music all?

SHIRLEY
The competitions at the National Sportin Club was worth nigh a hundred a year to him. He's gev em up now for religion; so he's a bit fresh for want of the exercise he was accustomed to. He'll be glad to see you. Come along.

BILL
Wots is weight?

SHIRLEY
Thirteen four. [Bill's last hope expires].

BARBARA
Go and talk to him, Bill. He'll convert you.

SHIRLEY
He'll convert your head into a mashed potato.

BILL
[sullenly] I ain't afraid of him. I ain't afraid of ennybody. But he can lick me. She's done me. [He sits down moodily on the edge of the horse trough].

SHIRLEY
You ain't goin. I thought not. [He resumes his seat].

BARBARA
[calling] Jenny!

JENNY
[appearing at the shelter door with a plaster on the corner of her mouth] Yes, Major.

BARBARA
Send Rummy Mitchens out to clear away here.

JENNY
I think she's afraid.

BARBARA
[her resemblance to her mother flashing out for a moment] Nonsense! she must do as she's told.

JENNY
[calling into the shelter] Rummy: the Major says you must come.

Jenny comes to Barbara, purposely keeping on the side next Bill, lest he should suppose that she shrank from him or bore malice.

BARBARA
Poor little Jenny! Are you tired? [Looking at the wounded cheek] Does it hurt?

JENNY
No: it's all right now. It was nothing.

BARBARA
[critically] It was as hard as he could hit, I expect. Poor Bill! You don't feel angry with him, do you?

JENNY
Oh no, no, no: indeed I don't, Major, bless his poor heart! [Barbara kisses her; and she runs away merrily into the shelter. Bill writhes with an agonizing return of his new and alarming symptoms, but says nothing. Rummy Mitchens comes from the shelter].

BARBARA
[going to meet Rummy] Now Rummy, bustle. Take in those mugs and plates to be washed; and throw the crumbs about for the birds.
Rummy takes the three plates and mugs; but Shirley takes back his mug from her, as there it still come milk left in it.

RUMMY
There ain't any crumbs. This ain't a time to waste good bread on birds.

PRICE
[appearing at the shelter door] Gentleman come to see the shelter, Major. Says he's your father.

BARBARA
All right. Coming. [Snobby goes back into the shelter, followed by Barbara].

RUMMY
[stealing across to Bill and addressing him in a subdued voice, but with intense conviction] I'd av the lor of you, you flat eared pignosed potwalloper, if she'd let me. You're no gentleman, to hit a lady in the face. [Bill, with greater things moving in him, takes no notice].

SHIRLEY
[following her] Here! in with you and don't get yourself into more trouble by talking.

RUMMY
[with hauteur] I ain't ad the pleasure o being hintroduced to you, as I can remember. [She goes into the shelter with the plates].

BILL
[savagely] Don't you talk to me, d'ye hear. You lea me alone, or I'll do you a mischief. I'm not dirt under your feet, anyway.

SHIRLEY
[calmly] Don't you be afeerd. You ain't such prime company that you need expect to be sought after. [He is about to go into the shelter when Barbara comes out, with Undershaft on her right].

BARBARA
Oh there you are, Mr Shirley! [Between them] This is my father: I told you he was a Secularist, didn't I? Perhaps you'll be able to comfort one another.

UNDERSHAFT
[startled] A Secularist! Not the least in the world: on the contrary, a confirmed mystic.

BARBARA
Sorry, I'm sure. By the way, papa, what is your religion--in case I have to introduce you again?

UNDERSHAFT
My religion? Well, my dear, I am a Millionaire. That is my religion.

BARBARA
Then I'm afraid you and Mr Shirley won't be able to comfort one another after all. You're not a Millionaire, are you, Peter?

SHIRLEY
No; and proud of it.

UNDERSHAFT
[gravely] Poverty, my friend, is not a thing to be proud of.

SHIRLEY
[angrily] Who made your millions for you? Me and my like. What's kep us poor? Keepin you rich. I wouldn't have your conscience, not for all your income.

UNDERSHAFT
I wouldn't have your income, not for all your conscience, Mr Shirley. [He goes to the penthouse and sits down on a form].

BARBARA
[stopping Shirley adroitly as he is about to retort] You wouldn't think he was my father, would you, Peter? Will you go into the shelter and lend the lasses a hand for a while: we're worked off our feet.

SHIRLEY
[bitterly] Yes: I'm in their debt for a meal, ain't I?

BARBARA
Oh, not because you're in their debt; but for love of them, Peter, for love of them. [He cannot understand, and is rather scandalized]. There! Don't stare at me. In with you; and give that conscience of yours a holiday [bustling him into the shelter].

SHIRLEY
[as he goes in] Ah! it's a pity you never was trained to use your reason, miss. You'd have been a very taking lecturer on Secularism.

Barbara turns to her father.

UNDERSHAFT
Never mind me, my dear. Go about your work; and let me watch it for a while.

BARBARA
All right.

UNDERSHAFT
For instance, what's the matter with that out-patient over there?

BARBARA
[looking at Bill, whose attitude has never changed, and whose expression of brooding wrath has deepened] Oh, we shall cure him in no time. Just watch. [She goes over to Bill and waits. He glances up at her and casts his eyes down again, uneasy, but grimmer than ever]. It would be nice to just stamp on Mog Habbijam's face, wouldn't it, Bill?

BILL
[starting up from the trough in consternation] It's a lie: I never said so. [She shakes her head]. Who told you wot was in my mind?

BARBARA
Only your new friend.

BILL
Wot new friend?

BARBARA
The devil, Bill. When he gets round people they get miserable, just like you.

HILL
[with a heartbreaking attempt at devil-may-care cheerfulness] I ain't miserable. [He sits down again, and stretches his legs in an attempt to seem indifferent].

BARBARA
Well, if you're happy, why don't you look happy, as we do?

BILL
[his legs curling back in spite of him] I'm appy enough, I tell you. Why don't you lea me alown? Wot av I done to you? I ain't smashed your face, av I?

BARBARA
[softly: wooing his soul] It's not me that's getting at you, Bill.

BILL
Who else is it?

BARBARA
Somebody that doesn't intend you to smash women's faces, I suppose. Somebody or something that wants to make a man of you.

BILL
[blustering] Make a man o ME! Ain't I a man? eh? ain't I a man? Who sez I'm not a man?

BARBARA
There's a man in you somewhere, I suppose. But why did he let you hit poor little Jenny Hill? That wasn't very manly of him, was it?

BILL
[tormented] Av done with it, I tell you. Chock it. I'm sick of your Jenny Ill and er silly little face.

BARBARA
Then why do you keep thinking about it? Why does it keep coming up against you in your mind? You're not getting converted, are you?

BILL
[with conviction] Not ME. Not likely. Not arf.

BARBARA
That's right, Bill. Hold out against it. Put out your strength. Don't let's get you cheap. Todger Fairmile said he wrestled for three nights against his Salvation harder than he ever wrestled with the Jap at the music hall. He gave in to the Jap when his arm was going to break. But he didn't give in to his salvation until his heart was going to break. Perhaps you'll escape that. You haven't any heart, have you?

BILL
Wot dye mean? Wy ain't I got a art the same as ennybody else?

BARBARA
A man with a heart wouldn't have bashed poor little Jenny's face, would he?

BILL
[almost crying] Ow, will you lea me alown? Av I ever offered to meddle with you, that you come noggin and provowkin me lawk this?
[He writhes convulsively from his eyes to his toes].

BARBARA
[with a steady soothing hand on his arm and a gentle voice that never lets him go] It's your soul that's hurting you, Bill, and not me. We've been through it all ourselves. Come with us, Bill. [He looks wildly round]. To brave manhood on earth and eternal glory in heaven. [He is on the point of breaking down]. Come. [A drum is heard in the shelter; and Bill, with a gasp, escapes from the spell as Barbara turns quickly. Adolphus enters from the shelter with a big drum]. Oh! there you are, Dolly. Let me introduce a new friend of mine, Mr Bill Walker. This is my bloke, Bill: Mr Cusins. [Cusins salutes with his drumstick].

BILL
Goin to marry im?

BARBARA
Yes.

BILL
[fervently] Gawd elp im! Gawd elp im!

BARBARA
Why? Do you think he won't be happy with me?

BILL
I've only ad to stand it for a mornin: e'll av to stand it for a lifetime.

CUSINS
That is a frightful reflection, Mr Walker. But I can't tear myself away from her.

BILL
Well, I can. [To Barbara] Eah! do you know where I'm goin to, and wot I'm goin to do?

BARBARA
Yes: you're going to heaven; and you're coming back here before the week's out to tell me so.

BILL
You lie. I'm goin to Kennintahn, to spit in Todger Fairmile's eye. I bashed Jenny Ill's face; and now I'll get me own face bashed and come back and show it to er. E'll it me ardern I it er. That'll make us square. [To Adolphus] Is that fair or is it not? You're a genlmn: you oughter know.

BARBARA
Two black eyes won't make one white one, Bill.

BILL
I didn't ast you. Cawn't you never keep your mahth shut? I ast the genlmn.

CUSINS
[reflectively] Yes: I think you're right, Mr Walker. Yes: I should do it. It's curious: it's exactly what an ancient Greek would have done.

BARBARA
But what good will it do?

CUSINS
Well, it will give Mr Fairmile some exercise; and it will satisfy Mr Walker's soul.

BILL
Rot! there ain't no sach a thing as a soul. Ah kin you tell wether I've a soul or not? You never seen it.

BARBARA
I've seen it hurting you when you went against it.

BILL
[with compressed aggravation] If you was my girl and took the word out o me mahth lawk thet, I'd give you suthink you'd feel urtin, so I would. [To Adolphus] You take my tip, mate. Stop er jawr; or you'll die afore your time. [With intense expression] Wore aht: thets wot you'll be: wore aht. [He goes away through the gate].

CUSINS
[looking after him] I wonder!

BARBARA
Dolly! [indignant, in her mother's manner].

CUSINS
Yes, my dear, it's very wearing to be in love with you. If it lasts, I quite think I shall die young.

BARBARA
Should you mind?

CUSINS
Not at all. [He is suddenly softened, and kisses her over the drum, evidently not for the first time, as people cannot kiss over a big drum without practice. Undershaft coughs].

BARBARA
It's all right, papa, we've not forgotten you. Dolly: explain the place to papa: I haven't time. [She goes busily into the shelter].

Undershaft and Adolpbus now have the yard to themselves. Undershaft, seated on a form, and still keenly attentive, looks hard at Adolphus. Adolphus looks hard at him.

UNDERSHAFT
I fancy you guess something of what is in my mind, Mr Cusins. [Cusins flourishes his drumsticks as if in the art of beating a lively rataplan, but makes no sound]. Exactly so. But suppose Barbara finds you out!

CUSINS
You know, I do not admit that I am imposing on Barbara. I am quite genuinely interested in the views of the Salvation Army. The fact is, I am a sort of collector of religions; and the curious thing is that I find I can believe them all. By the way, have you any religion?

UNDERSHAFT
Yes.

CUSINS
Anything out of the common?

UNDERSHAFT
Only that there are two things necessary to Salvation.

CUSINS
[disappointed, but polite] Ah, the Church Catechism. Charles Lomax also belongs to the Established Church.

UNDERSHAFT
The two things are--

CUSINS
Baptism and--

UNDERSHAFT
No. Money and gunpowder.

CUSINS
[surprised, but interested] That is the general opinion of our governing classes. The novelty is in hearing any man confess it.

UNDERSHAFT
Just so.

CUSINS
Excuse me: is there any place in your religion for honor, justice, truth, love, mercy and so forth?

UNDERSHAFT
Yes: they are the graces and luxuries of a rich, strong, and safe life.

CUSINS
Suppose one is forced to choose between them and money or gunpowder?

UNDERSHAFT
Choose money and gunpowder; for without enough of both you cannot afford the others.

CUSINS
That is your religion?

UNDERSHAFT
Yes.

The cadence of this reply makes a full close in the conversation. Cusins twists his face dubiously and contemplates Undershaft. Undershaft contemplates him.

CUSINS
Barbara won't stand that. You will have to choose between your religion and Barbara.

UNDERSHAFT
So will you, my friend. She will find out that that drum of yours is hollow.

CUSINS
Father Undershaft: you are mistaken: I am a sincere Salvationist. You do not understand the Salvation Army. It is the army of joy, of love, of courage: it has banished the fear and remorse and despair of the old hellridden evangelical sects: it marches to fight the devil with trumpet and drum, with music and dancing, with banner and palm, as becomes a sally from heaven by its happy garrison. It picks the waster out of the public house and makes a man of him: it finds a worm wriggling in a back kitchen, and lo! a woman! Men and women of rank too, sons and daughters of the Highest. It takes the poor professor of Greek, the most artificial and self-suppressed of human creatures, from his meal of roots, and lets loose the rhapsodist in him; reveals the true worship of Dionysos to him; sends him down the public street drumming dithyrambs [he plays a thundering flourish on the drum].

UNDERSHAFT
You will alarm the shelter.

CUSINS
Oh, they are accustomed to these sudden ecstasies of piety. However, if the drum worries you-- [he pockets the drumsticks; unhooks the drum; and stands it on the ground opposite the gateway].

UNDERSHAFT
Thank you.

CUSINS
You remember what Euripides says about your money and gunpowder?

UNDERSHAFT
No.

CUSINS
[declaiming]
One and another
In money and guns may outpass his brother;
And men in their millions float and flow
And seethe with a million hopes as leaven;
And they win their will; or they miss their will;
And their hopes are dead or are pined for still:
But whoe'er can know
As the long days go
That to live is happy, has found his heaven.
My translation: what do you think of it?

UNDERSHAFT
I think, my friend, that if you wish to know, as the long days go, that to live is happy, you must first acquire money enough for a decent life, and power enough to be your own master.

CUSINS
You are damnably discouraging. [He resumes his declamation].
Is it so hard a thing to see
That the spirit of God--whate'er it be--
The Law that abides and changes not, ages long,
The Eternal and Nature-born: these things be strong.
What else is Wisdom? What of Man's endeavor,
Or God's high grace so lovely and so great?
To stand from fear set free? to breathe and wait?
To hold a hand uplifted over Fate?
And shall not Barbara be loved for ever?

UNDERSHAFT
Euripides mentions Barbara, does he?

CUSINS
It is a fair translation. The word means Loveliness.

UNDERSHAFT
May I ask--as Barbara's father--how much a year she is to be loved for ever on?

CUSINS
As Barbara's father, that is more your affair than mine. I can feed her by teaching Greek: that is about all.

UNDERSHAFT
Do you consider it a good match for her?

CUSINS
[with polite obstinacy] Mr Undershaft: I am in many ways a weak, timid, ineffectual person; and my health is far from satisfactory. But whenever I feel that I must have anything, I get it, sooner or later. I feel that way about Barbara. I don't like marriage: I feel intensely afraid of it; and I don't know what I shall do with Barbara or what she will do with me. But I feel that I and nobody else must marry her. Please regard that as settled.--Not that I wish to be arbitrary; but why should I waste your time in discussing what is inevitable?

UNDERSHAFT
You mean that you will stick at nothing not even the conversion of the Salvation Army to the worship of Dionysos.

CUSINS
The business of the Salvation Army is to save, not to wrangle about the name of the pathfinder. Dionysos or another: what does it matter?

UNDERSHAFT
[rising and approaching him] Professor Cusins you are a young man after my own heart.

CUSINS
Mr Undershaft: you are, as far as I am able to gather, a most infernal old rascal; but you appeal very strongly to my sense of ironic humor.

Undershaft mutely offers his hand. They shake.

UNDERSHAFT
[suddenly concentrating himself] And now to business.

CUSINS
Pardon me. We were discussing religion. Why go back to such an uninteresting and unimportant subject as business?

UNDERSHAFT
Religion is our business at present, because it is through religion alone that we can win Barbara.

CUSINS
Have you, too, fallen in love with Barbara?

UNDERSHAFT
Yes, with a father's love.

CUSINS
A father's love for a grown-up daughter is the most dangerous of all infatuations. I apologize for mentioning my own pale, coy, mistrustful fancy in the same breath with it.

UNDERSHAFT
Keep to the point. We have to win her; and we are neither of us Methodists.

CUSINS
That doesn't matter. The power Barbara wields here--the power that wields Barbara herself--is not Calvinism, not Presbyterianism, not Methodism--

UNDERSHAFT
Not Greek Paganism either, eh?

CUSINS
I admit that. Barbara is quite original in her religion.

UNDERSHAFT
[triumphantly] Aha! Barbara Undershaft would be. Her inspiration comes from within herself.

CUSINS
How do you suppose it got there?

UNDERSHAFT
[in towering excitement] It is the Undershaft inheritance. I shall hand on my torch to my daughter. She shall make my converts and preach my gospel.

CUSINS
What! Money and gunpowder!

UNDERSHAFT
Yes, money and gunpowder; freedom and power; command of life and command of death.

CUSINS
[urbanely: trying to bring him down to earth] This is extremely interesting, Mr Undershaft. Of course you know that you are mad.

UNDERSHAFT
[with redoubled force] And you?

CUSINS
Oh, mad as a hatter. You are welcome to my secret since I have discovered yours. But I am astonished. Can a madman make cannons?

UNDERSHAFT
Would anyone else than a madman make them? And now [with surging energy] question for question. Can a sane man translate Euripides?

CUSINS
No.

UNDERSHAFT
[reining him by the shoulder] Can a sane woman make a man of a waster or a woman of a worm?

CUSINS
[reeling before the storm] Father Colossus--Mammoth Millionaire--

UNDERSHAFT
[pressing him] Are there two mad people or three in this Salvation shelter to-day?

CUSINS
You mean Barbara is as mad as we are!

UNDERSHAFT
[pushing him lightly off and resuming his equanimity suddenly and completely] Pooh, Professor! let us call things by their proper names. I am a millionaire; you are a poet; Barbara is a savior of souls. What have we three to do with the common mob of slaves and idolaters? [He sits down again with a shrug of contempt for the mob].

CUSINS
Take care! Barbara is in love with the common people. So am I. Have you never felt the romance of that love?

UNDERSHAFT
[cold and sardonic] Have you ever been in love with Poverty, like St Francis? Have you ever been in love with Dirt, like St Simeon? Have you ever been in love with disease and suffering, like our nurses and philanthropists? Such passions are not virtues, but the most unnatural of all the vices. This love of the common people may please an earl's granddaughter and a university professor; but I have been a common man and a poor man; and it has no romance for me. Leave it to the poor to pretend that poverty is a blessing: leave it to the coward to make a religion of his cowardice by preaching humility: we know better than that. We three must stand together above the common people: how else can we help their children to climb up beside us? Barbara must belong to us, not to the Salvation Army.

CUSINS
Well, I can only say that if you think you will get her away from the Salvation Army by talking to her as you have been talking to me, you don't know Barbara.

UNDERSHAFT
My friend: I never ask for what I can buy.

CUSINS
[in a white fury] Do I understand you to imply that you can buy Barbara?

UNDERSHAFT
No; but I can buy the Salvation Army.

CUSINS
Quite impossible.

UNDERSHAFT
You shall see. All religious organizations exist by selling themselves to the rich.

CUSINS
Not the Army. That is the Church of the poor.

UNDERSHAFT
All the more reason for buying it.

CUSINS
I don't think you quite know what the Army does for the poor.

UNDERSHAFT
Oh yes I do. It draws their teeth: that is enough for me--as a man of business--

CUSINS
Nonsense! It makes them sober--

UNDERSHAFT
I prefer sober workmen. The profits are larger.

CUSINS
--honest--

UNDERSHAFT
Honest workmen are the most economical.

CUSINS
--attached to their homes--

UNDERSHAFT
So much the better: they will put up with anything sooner than change their shop.

CUSINS
--happy--

UNDERSHAFT
An invaluable safeguard against revolution.

CUSINS
--unselfish--

UNDERSHAFT
Indifferent to their own interests, which suits me exactly.

CUSINS
--with their thoughts on heavenly things--

UNDERSHAFT
[rising] And not on Trade Unionism nor Socialism. Excellent.

CUSINS
[revolted] You really are an infernal old rascal.

UNDERSHAFT
[indicating Peter Shirley, who has just came from the shelter and strolled dejectedly down the yard between them] And this is an honest man!

SHIRLEY
Yes; and what av I got by it? [he passes on bitterly and sits on the form, in the corner of the penthouse].
Snobby Price, beaming sanctimoniously, and Jenny Hill, with a tambourine full of coppers, come from the shelter and go to the drum, on which Jenny begins to count the money.

UNDERSHAFT
[replying to Shirley] Oh, your employers must have got a good deal by it from first to last. [He sits on the table, with one foot on the side form. Cusins, overwhelmed, sits down on the same form nearer the shelter. Barbara comes from the shelter to the middle of the yard. She is excited and a little overwrought].

BARBARA
We've just had a splendid experience meeting at the other gate in Cripps's lane. I've hardly ever seen them so much moved as they were by your confession, Mr Price.

PRICE
I could almost be glad of my past wickedness if I could believe that it would elp to keep hathers stright.

BARBARA
So it will, Snobby. How much, Jenny?

JENNY
Four and tenpence, Major.

BARBARA
Oh Snobby, if you had given your poor mother just one more kick, we should have got the whole five shillings!

PRICE
If she heard you say that, miss, she'd be sorry I didn't. But I'm glad. Oh what a joy it will be to her when she hears I'm saved!

UNDERSHAFT
Shall I contribute the odd twopence, Barbara? The millionaire's mite, eh? [He takes a couple of pennies from his pocket.]

BARBARA
How did you make that twopence?

UNDERSHAFT
As usual. By selling cannons, torpedoes, submarines, and my new patent Grand Duke hand grenade.

BARBARA
Put it back in your pocket. You can't buy your Salvation here for twopence: you must work it out.

UNDERSHAFT
Is twopence not enough? I can afford a little more, if you press me.

BARBARA
Two million millions would not be enough. There is bad blood on your hands; and nothing but good blood can cleanse them. Money is no use. Take it away. [She turns to Cusins]. Dolly: you must write another letter for me to the papers. [He makes a wry face]. Yes: I know you don't like it; but it must be done. The starvation this winter is beating us: everybody is unemployed. The General says we must close this shelter if we can't get more money. I force the collections at the meetings until I am ashamed, don't I, Snobby?

PRICE
It's a fair treat to see you work it, miss. The way you got them up from three-and-six to four-and-ten with that hymn, penny by penny and verse by verse, was a caution. Not a Cheap Jack on Mile End Waste could touch you at it.

BARBARA
Yes; but I wish we could do without it. I am getting at last to think more of the collection than of the people's souls. And what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence? We want thousands! tens of thousands! hundreds of thousands! I want to convert people, not to be always begging for the Army in a way I'd die sooner than beg for myself.

UNDERSHAFT
[in profound irony] Genuine unselfishness is capable of anything, my dear.

BARBARA
[unsuspectingly, as she turns away to take the money from the drum and put it in a cash bag she carries] Yes, isn't it? [Undershaft looks sardonically at Cusins].

CUSINS
[aside to Undershaft] Mephistopheles! Machiavelli!

BARBARA
[tears coming into her eyes as she ties the bag and pockets it] How are we to feed them? I can't talk religion to a man with bodily hunger in his eyes. [Almost breaking down] It's frightful.

JENNY
[running to her] Major, dear--

BARBARA
[rebounding] No: don't comfort me. It will be all right. We shall get the money.

UNDERSHAFT
How?

JENNY
By praying for it, of course. Mrs Baines says she prayed for it last night; and she has never prayed for it in vain: never once. [She goes to the gate and looks out into the street].

BARBARA
[who has dried her eyes and regained her composure] By the way, dad, Mrs Baines has come to march with us to our big meeting this afternoon; and she is very anxious to meet you, for some reason or other. Perhaps she'll convert you.

UNDERSHAFT
I shall be delighted, my dear.

JENNY
[at the gate: excitedly] Major! Major! Here's that man back again.

BARBARA
What man?

JENNY
The man that hit me. Oh, I hope he's coming back to join us.

Bill Walker, with frost on his jacket, comes through the gate, his hands deep in his pockets and his chin sunk between his shoulders, like a cleaned-out gambler. He halts between Barbara and the drum.

BARBARA
Hullo, Bill! Back already!

BILL
[nagging at her] Bin talkin ever sense, av you?

BARBARA
Pretty nearly. Well, has Todger paid you out for poor Jenny's jaw?

BILL
NO he ain't.

BARBARA
I thought your jacket looked a bit snowy.

BILL
So it is snowy. You want to know where the snow come from, don't you?

BARBARA
Yes.

BILL
Well, it come from off the ground in Parkinses Corner in Kennintahn. It got rubbed off be my shoulders see?

BARBARA
Pity you didn't rub some off with your knees, Bill! That would have done you a lot of good.

BILL
[with your mirthless humor] I was saving another man's knees at the time. E was kneelin on my ed, so e was.

JENNY
Who was kneeling on your head?

BILL
Todger was. E was prayin for me: prayin comfortable with me as a carpet. So was Mog. So was the ole bloomin meetin. Mog she sez ""O Lord break is stubborn spirit; but don't urt is dear art."" That was wot she said. ""Don't urt is dear art""! An er bloke--thirteen stun four!--kneelin wiv all is weight on me. Funny, ain't it?

JENNY
Oh no. We're so sorry, Mr Walker.

BARBARA
[enjoying it frankly] Nonsense! of course it's funny. Served you right, Bill! You must have done something to him first.

BILL
[doggedly] I did wot I said I'd do. I spit in is eye. E looks up at the sky and sez, ""O that I should be fahnd worthy to be spit upon for the gospel's sake!"" a sez; an Mog sez ""Glory Allelloolier!""; an then a called me Brother, an dahned me as if I was a kid and a was me mother washin me a Setterda nawt. I adn't just no show wiv im at all. Arf the street prayed; an the tother arf larfed fit to split theirselves. [To Barbara] There! are you settisfawd nah?

BARBARA
[her eyes dancing] Wish I'd been there, Bill.

BILL
Yes: you'd a got in a hextra bit o talk on me, wouldn't you?

JENNY
I'm so sorry, Mr. Walker.

BILL
[fiercely] Don't you go bein sorry for me: you've no call. Listen ere. I broke your jawr.

JENNY
No, it didn't hurt me: indeed it didn't, except for a moment. It was only that I was frightened.

BILL
I don't want to be forgive be you, or be ennybody. Wot I did I'll pay for. I tried to get me own jawr broke to settisfaw you--

JENNY
[distressed] Oh no--

BILL
[impatiently] Tell y'I did: cawn't you listen to wot's bein told you? All I got be it was bein made a sight of in the public street for me pains. Well, if I cawn't settisfaw you one way, I can another. Listen ere! I ad two quid saved agen the frost; an I've a pahnd of it left. A mate n mine last week ad words with the Judy e's goin to marry. E give er wot-for; an e's bin fined fifteen bob. E ad a right to it er because they was goin to be marrid; but I adn't no right to it you; so put anather fawv bob on an call it a pahnd's worth. [He produces a sovereign]. Ere's the money. Take it; and let's av no more o your forgivin an prayin and your Major jawrin me. Let wot I done be done and paid for; and let there be a end of it.

JENNY
Oh, I couldn't take it, Mr. Walker. But if you would give a shilling or two to poor Rummy Mitchens! you really did hurt her; and she's old.

BILL
[contemptuously] Not likely. I'd give her anather as soon as look at er. Let her av the lawr o me as she threatened! She ain't forgiven me: not mach. Wot I done to er is not on me mawnd--wot she [indicating Barbara] might call on me conscience--no more than stickin a pig. It's this Christian game o yours that I won't av played agen me: this bloomin forgivin an noggin an jawrin that makes a man that sore that iz lawf's a burdn to im. I won't av it, I tell you; so take your money and stop throwin your silly bashed face hup agen me.

JENNY
Major: may I take a little of it for the Army?

BARBARA
No: the Army is not to be bought. We want your soul, Bill; and we'll take nothing less.

BILL
[bitterly] I know. It ain't enough. Me an me few shillins is not good enough for you. You're a earl's grendorter, you are. Nothin less than a underd pahnd for you.

UNDERSHAFT
Come, Barbara! you could do a great deal of good with a hundred pounds. If you will set this gentleman's mind at ease by taking his pound, I will give the other ninety-nine [Bill, astounded by such opulence, instinctively touches his cap].

BARBARA
Oh, you're too extravagant, papa. Bill offers twenty pieces of silver. All you need offer is the other ten. That will make the standard price to buy anybody who's for sale. I'm not; and the Army's not. [To Bill] You'll never have another quiet moment, Bill, until you come round to us. You can't stand out against your salvation.

BILL
[sullenly] I cawn't stend aht agen music all wrastlers and artful tongued women. I've offered to pay. I can do no more. Take it or leave it. There it is. [He throws the sovereign on the drum, and sits down on the horse-trough. The coin fascinates Snobby Price, who takes an early opportunity of dropping his cap on it].

Mrs Baines comes from the shelter. She is dressed as a Salvation Army Commissioner. She is an earnest looking woman of about 40, with a caressing, urgent voice, and an appealing manner.

BARBARA
This is my father, Mrs Baines. [Undershaft comes from the table, taking his hat off with marked civility]. Try what you can do with him. He won't listen to me, because he remembers what a fool I was when I was a baby.

[She leaves them together and chats with Jenny].

MRS BAINES
Have you been shown over the shelter, Mr Undershaft? You know the work we're doing, of course.

UNDERSHAFT
[very civilly] The whole nation knows it, Mrs Baines.

MRS BAINES
No, Sir: the whole nation does not know it, or we should not be crippled as we are for want of money to carry our work through the length and breadth of the land. Let me tell you that there would have been rioting this winter in London but for us.

UNDERSHAFT
You really think so?

MRS BAINES
I know it. I remember 1886, when you rich gentlemen hardened your hearts against the cry of the poor. They broke the windows of your clubs in Pall Mall.

UNDERSHAFT
[gleaming with approval of their method] And the Mansion House Fund went up next day from thirty thousand pounds to seventy-nine thousand! I remember quite well.

MRS BAINES
Well, won't you help me to get at the people? They won't break windows then. Come here, Price. Let me show you to this gentleman [Price comes to be inspected]. Do you remember the window breaking?

PRICE
My ole father thought it was the revolution, ma'am.

MRS BAINES
Would you break windows now?

PRICE
Oh no ma'm. The windows of eaven av bin opened to me. I know now that the rich man is a sinner like myself.

RUMMY
[appearing above at the loft door] Snobby Price!

SNOBBY
Wot is it?

RUMMY
Your mother's askin for you at the other gate in Crippses Lane. She's heard about your confession [Price turns pale].

MRS BAINES
Go, Mr. Price; and pray with her.

JENNY
You can go through the shelter, Snobby.

PRICE
[to Mrs Baines] I couldn't face her now; ma'am, with all the weight of my sins fresh on me. Tell her she'll find her son at ome, waitin for her in prayer. [He skulks off through the gate, incidentally stealing the sovereign on his way out by picking up his cap from the drum].

MRS BAINES
[with swimming eyes] You see how we take the anger and the bitterness against you out of their hearts, Mr Undershaft.

UNDERSHAFT
It is certainly most convenient and gratifying to all large employers of labor, Mrs Baines.

MRS BAINES
Barbara: Jenny: I have good news: most wonderful news. [Jenny runs to her]. My prayers have been answered. I told you they would, Jenny, didn't I?

JENNY
Yes, yes.

BARBARA
[moving nearer to the drum] Have we got money enough to keep the shelter open?

MRS BAINES
I hope we shall have enough to keep all the shelters open. Lord Saxmundham has promised us five thousand pounds--

BARBARA
Hooray!

JENNY
Glory!

MRS BAINES
--if--

BARBARA
""If!"" If what?

MRS BAINES
If five other gentlemen will give a thousand each to make it up to ten thousand.

BARBARA
Who is Lord Saxmundham? I never heard of him.

UNDERSHAFT
[who has pricked up his ears at the peer's name, and is now watching Barbara curiously] A new creation, my dear. You have heard of Sir Horace Bodger?

BARBARA
Bodger! Do you mean the distiller? Bodger's whisky!

UNDERSHAFT
That is the man. He is one of the greatest of our public benefactors. He restored the cathedral at Hakington. They made him a baronet for that. He gave half a million to the funds of his party: they made him a baron for that.

SHIRLEY
What will they give him for the five thousand?

UNDERSHAFT
There is nothing left to give him. So the five thousand, I should think, is to save his soul.

MRS BAINES
Heaven grant it may! Oh Mr. Undershaft, you have some very rich friends. Can't you help us towards the other five thousand? We are going to hold a great meeting this afternoon at the Assembly Hall in the Mile End Road. If I could only announce that one gentleman had come forward to support Lord Saxmundham, others would follow. Don't you know somebody? Couldn't you? Wouldn't you? [her eyes fill with tears] oh, think of those poor people, Mr Undershaft: think of how much it means to them, and how little to a great man like you.

UNDERSHAFT
[sardonically gallant] Mrs Baines: you are irresistible. I can't disappoint you; and I can't deny myself the satisfaction of making Bodger pay up. You shall have your five thousand pounds.

MRS BAINES
Thank God!

UNDERSHAFT
You don't thank me?

MRS BAINES
Oh sir, don't try to be cynical: don't be ashamed of being a good man. The Lord will bless you abundantly; and our prayers will be like a strong fortification round you all the days of your life. [With a touch of caution] You will let me have the cheque to show at the meeting, won't you? Jenny: go in and fetch a pen and ink. [Jenny runs to the shelter door].

UNDERSHAFT
Do not disturb Miss Hill: I have a fountain pen. [Jenny halts. He sits at the table and writes the cheque. Cusins rises to make more room for him. They all watch him silently].

BILL
[cynically, aside to Barbara, his voice and accent horribly debased] Wot prawce Selvytion nah?

BARBARA
Stop. [Undershaft stops writing: they all turn to her in surprise]. Mrs Baines: are you really going to take this money?

MRS BAINES
[astonished] Why not, dear?

BARBARA
Why not! Do you know what my father is? Have you forgotten that Lord Saxmundham is Bodger the whisky man? Do you remember how we implored the County Council to stop him from writing Bodger's Whisky in letters of fire against the sky; so that the poor drinkruined creatures on the embankment could not wake up from their snatches of sleep without being reminded of their deadly thirst by that wicked sky sign? Do you know that the worst thing I have had to fight here is not the devil, but Bodger, Bodger, Bodger, with his whisky, his distilleries, and his tied houses? Are you going to make our shelter another tied house for him, and ask me to keep it?

BILL
Rotten drunken whisky it is too.

MRS BAINES
Dear Barbara: Lord Saxmundham has a soul to be saved like any of us. If heaven has found the way to make a good use of his money, are we to set ourselves up against the answer to our prayers?

BARBARA. I know he has a soul to be saved. Let him come down here; and I'll do my best to help him to his salvation. But he wants to send his cheque down to buy us, and go on being as wicked as ever.

UNDERSHAFT [with a reasonableness which Cusins alone perceives to be ironical] My dear Barbara: alcohol is a very necessary article. It heals the sick--

BARBARA
It does nothing of the sort.

UNDERSHAFT
Well, it assists the doctor: that is perhaps a less questionable way of putting it. It makes life bearable to millions of people who could not endure their existence if they were quite sober. It enables Parliament to do things at eleven at night that no sane person would do at eleven in the morning. Is it Bodger's fault that this inestimable gift is deplorably abused by less than one per cent of the poor? [He turns again to the table; signs the cheque; and crosses it].

MRS BAINES
Barbara: will there be less drinking or more if all those poor souls we are saving come to-morrow and find the doors of our shelters shut in their faces? Lord Saxmundham gives us the money to stop drinking--to take his own business from him.

CUSINS
[impishly] Pure self-sacrifice on Bodger's part, clearly! Bless dear Bodger! [Barbara almost breaks down as Adolpbus, too,
fails her].

UNDERSHAFT
[tearing out the cheque and pocketing the book as he rises and goes past Cusins to Mrs Baines] I also, Mrs Baines, may claim a little disinterestedness. Think of my business! think of the widows and orphans! the men and lads torn to pieces with shrapnel and poisoned with lyddite [Mrs Baines shrinks; but he goes on remorselessly]! the oceans of blood, not one drop of which is shed in a really just cause! the ravaged crops! the peaceful peasants forced, women and men, to till their fields under the fire of opposing armies on pain of starvation! the bad blood of the fierce little cowards at home who egg on others to fight for the gratification of their national vanity! All this makes money for me: I am never richer, never busier than when the papers are full of it. Well, it is your work to preach peace on earth and goodwill to men. [Mrs Baines's face lights up again]. Every convert you make is a vote against war. [Her lips move in prayer]. Yet I give you this money to help you to hasten my own commercial ruin. [He gives her the cheque].

CUSINS
[mounting the form in an ecstasy of mischief] The millennium will be inaugurated by the unselfishness of Undershaft and Bodger. Oh be joyful! [He takes the drumsticks from his pockets and flourishes them].

MRS BAINES
[taking the cheque] The longer I live the more proof I see that there is an Infinite Goodness that turns everything to the work of salvation sooner or later. Who would have thought that any good could have come out of war and drink? And yet their profits are brought today to the feet of salvation to do its blessed work. [She is affected to tears].

JENNY
[running to Mrs Baines and throwing her arms round her] Oh dear! how blessed, how glorious it all is!
CUSINS [in a convulsion of irony] Let us seize this unspeakable moment. Let us march to the great meeting at once. Excuse me just an instant. [He rushes into the shelter. Jenny takes her tambourine from the drum head].

MRS BAINES
Mr Undershaft: have you ever seen a thousand people fall on their knees with one impulse and pray? Come with us to the meeting. Barbara shall tell them that the Army is saved, and saved through you.

CUSINS
[returning impetuously from the shelter with a flag and a trombone, and coming between Mrs Baines and Undershaft] You shall carry the flag down the first street, Mrs Baines [he gives her the flag]. Mr Undershaft is a gifted trombonist: he shall intone an Olympian diapason to the West Ham Salvation March. [Aside to Undershaft, as he forces the trombone on him] Blow, Machiavelli, blow.

UNDERSHAFT
[aside to him, as he takes the trombone] The trumpet in Zion! [Cusins rushes to the drum, which he takes up and puts on. Undershaft continues, aloud] I will do my best. I could vamp a bass if I knew the tune.

CUSINS
It is a wedding chorus from one of Donizetti's operas; but we have converted it. We convert everything to good here, including Bodger. You remember the chorus. ""For thee immense rejoicing--immenso giubilo--immenso giubilo."" [With drum obbligato] Rum tum ti tum tum, tum tum ti ta--

BARBARA
Dolly: you are breaking my heart.

CUSINS
What is a broken heart more or less here? Dionysos Undershaft has descended. I am possessed.
MRS BAINES. Come, Barbara: I must have my dear Major to carry the flag with me.

JENNY
Yes, yes, Major darling.

CUSINS
[snatches the tambourine out of Jenny's hand and mutely offers it to Barbara].

BARBARA
[coming forward a little as she puts the offer behind her with a shudder, whilst Cusins recklessly tosses the tambourine back to Jenny and goes to the gate] I can't come.

JENNY
Not come!

MRS BAINES
[with tears in her eyes] Barbara: do you think I am wrong to take the money?

BARBARA
[impulsively going to her and kissing her] No, no: God help you, dear, you must: you are saving the Army. Go; and may you have a great meeting!

JENNY
But arn't you coming?

BARBARA
No. [She begins taking off the silver brooch from her collar].

MRS BAINES
Barbara: what are you doing?

JENNY
Why are you taking your badge off? You can't be going to leave us, Major.

BARBARA
[quietly] Father: come here.

UNDERSHAFT
[coming to her] My dear! [Seeing that she is going to pin the badge on his collar, he retreats to the penthouse in some alarm].

BARBARA
[following him] Don't be frightened. [She pins the badge on and steps back towards the table, showing him to the others] There! It's not much for 5000 pounds is it?

MRS BAINES
Barbara: if you won't come and pray with us, promise me you will pray for us.

BARBARA
I can't pray now. Perhaps I shall never pray again.

MRS BAINES
Barbara!

JENNY
Major!

BARBARA
[almost delirious] I can't bear any more. Quick march!

CUSINS
[calling to the procession in the street outside] Off we go. Play up, there! Immenso giubilo. [He gives the time with his drum; and the band strikes up the march, which rapidly becomes more distant as the procession moves briskly away].

MRS BAINES
I must go, dear. You're overworked: you will be all right tomorrow. We'll never lose you. Now Jenny: step out with the old flag. Blood and Fire! [She marches out through the gate with her flag].

JENNY
Glory Hallelujah! [flourishing her tambourine and marching].

UNDERSHAFT
[to Cusins, as he marches out past him easing the slide of his trombone] ""My ducats and my daughter""!

CUSINS
[following him out] Money and gunpowder!

BARBARA
Drunkenness and Murder! My God: why hast thou forsaken me?
She sinks on the form with her face buried in her hands. The march passes away into silence. Bill Walker steals across to her.

BILL
[taunting] Wot prawce Selvytion nah?

SHIRLEY
Don't you hit her when she's down.

BILL
She it me wen aw wiz dahn. Waw shouldn't I git a bit o me own back?

BARBARA
[raising her head] I didn't take your money, Bill. [She crosses the yard to the gate and turns her back on the two men to hide her face from them].

BILL
[sneering after her] Naow, it warn't enough for you. [Turning to the drum, he misses the money]. Ellow! If you ain't took it summun else az. Were's it gorn? Blame me if Jenny Ill didn't take it arter all!

[Bill snatches up Shirley's mug and hurls it at her. She slams the loft door and vanishes. The mug smashes against the door and falls in fragments].

BILL
[beginning to chuckle] Tell us, ole man, wot o'clock this morrun was it wen im as they call Snobby Prawce was sived?

BARBARA
[turning to him more composedly, and with unspoiled sweetness] About half past twelve, Bill. And he pinched your pound at a quarter to two. I know. Well, you can't afford to lose it. I'll send it to you.

BILL
[his voice and accent suddenly improving] Not if I was to starve for it. I ain't to be bought.

SHIRLEY
Ain't you? You'd sell yourself to the devil for a pint o beer; ony there ain't no devil to make the offer.

BILL
[unshamed] So I would, mate, and often av, cheerful. But she cawn't buy me. [Approaching Barbara] You wanted my soul, did you? Well, you ain't got it.

BARBARA
I nearly got it, Bill. But we've sold it back to you for ten thousand pounds.

SHIRLEY
And dear at the money!

BARBARA
No, Peter: it was worth more than money.

BILL
[salvationproof] It's no good: you cawn't get rahnd me nah. I don't blieve in it; and I've seen today that I was right. [Going] So long, old soupkitchener! Ta, ta, Major Earl's Grendorter! [Turning at the gate] Wot prawce Selvytion nah? Snobby Prawce! Ha! ha!

BARBARA
[offering her hand] Goodbye, Bill.

BARBARA
No malice. So long, Bill.

SHIRLEY
[shaking his head] You make too much of him, miss, in your innocence.

BARBARA
[going to him] Peter: I'm like you now. Cleaned out, and lost my job.

SHIRLEY
You've youth an hope. That's two better than me. That's hope for you.

BARBARA
I'll get you a job, Peter, the youth will have to be enough for me. [She counts her money]. I have just enough left for two teas at Lockharts, a Rowton doss for you, and my tram and bus home. [He frowns and rises with offended pride. She takes his arm]. Don't be proud, Peter: it's sharing between friends. And promise me you'll talk to me and not let me cry. [She draws him towards the gate].

SHIRLEY
Well, I'm not accustomed to talk to the like of you--

BARBARA
[urgently] Yes, yes: you must talk to me. Tell me about Tom Paine's books and Bradlaugh's lectures. Come along.

Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours cus I don't got mine?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
Or when niggas holla, ""What's up?"" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you"" (Sometimes)

We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And so she said ""Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, ""Hi, Daddy""?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me?"" (Sometimes)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Outro: Lamont Carey]
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love",Kendrick Lamar,1967,[80],1

I'm coming home
Wait for me
I'm coming home
Wait for me, wait for me

[Verse 1]
Murder charges, drug charges coming back to back
Hoes jumping off the ship and they ain't looking back
She telling me to have faith but where hers at?
Since I got this charge, her voice, I ain't heard that
I wrote ya, told ya that I knew that I was coming home
Yo words ain't match when you wrote back you thought I was gone
I even told my dog to leave a message on your phone
Do you, but be here for me, just don't leave a nigga alone
My cellie just got off the phone
Told me to leave em alone
State just murdered his son, he grabbed his Quran
Lit up his cigarette, thought back before his jail came
Was easy to take over I already had the jail fame
3 or 4 bitches,(What they did?) they told me lies
I told them I was coming home, they rolled their eyes
Security guard at my cell, with a cold smile
What I told you at visit, girl? shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They tried to take my life
The system did me wrong
So I prayed at night, fuck that, I'm coming home
Knew If I was coming home then I was coming home strong
Came home, murdered every fucking song that I got on
Phone ranging, it's that money, it's everywhere I go
I know that bitch thinking ""I should've stayed, this nigga getting paid""
I used to have a kind of side we did a little spending
But my new bitch rock furs, Louis and Fendi
Red light I get the picture, the phone block
I call and you hung up, I think I know wassup now
Father God I've been betrayed again
Feel like they beat me like a slave again
So many counted Boosie out, when they read the line
But nobody knew the case, so I sat and smiled
In the mirror working out, time to get it in
Interviews telling my fans from the pen

Foreword

On April 3, 2014, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted to send the Findings and Conclusions and the Executive Summary of its final Study on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to the President for declassification and subsequent public release.

This action marked the culmination of a monumental effort that officially began with the Committee's decision to initiate the Study in March 2009, but which had its roots in an investigation into the CIA's destruction of videotapes of CIA detainee interrogations that began in December 2007.

The full Committee Study, which totals more than 6,700 pages, remains classified but is now an official Senate report. The full report has been provided to the White House, the CIA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the hopes that it will prevent future coercive interrogation practices and inform the management of other covert action programs. As the Chairman of the Committee since 2009, I write to offer some additional views, context, and history.

I began my service on the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2001. I remember testimony that summer from George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, that warned of a possible major terrorist event against the United States, but without specifics on the time, location, or method of attack. On September 11, 2001, the world learned the answers to those questions that had consumed the CIA and other parts of the U.S. Intelligence Community.*

I recall vividly watching the horror of that day, to include the television footage of innocent men and women jumping out of the World Trade Center towers to escape the fire. The images, and the sounds as their bodies hit the pavement far below, will remain with me for the rest of my life.

It is against that backdrop - the largest attack against the American homeland in our history - that the events described in this report were undertaken.

*For information on the events at the CIA prior to September 11, 2001, see the Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (9/11 Commission) and Office of the Inspector General Report on CIA Accountability With Respect to the 9/11 Attacks.

Nearly 13 years later, the Executive Summary and Findings and Conclusions of this report are being released. They are highly critical of the CIA's actions, and rightfully so. Reading them, it is easy to forget the context in which the program began - not that the context should serve as an excuse, but rather as a warning for the future.

It is worth remembering the pervasive fear in late 2001 and how immediate the threat felt. Just a week after the September 11 attacks, powdered anthrax was sent to various news organizations and to two U.S. Senators. The American public was shocked by news of new terrorist plots and elevations of the color-coded threat level of the Homeland Security Advisory System. We expected further attacks against the nation.

I have attempted throughout to remember the impact on the nation and to the CIA workforce from the attacks of September 11, 2001. I can understand the CIA's impulse to consider the use of every possible tool to gather intelligence and remove terrorists from the battlefield,^ and CIA was encouraged by political leaders and the public to do whatever it could to prevent another attack. The Intelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events.

Nevertheless, such pressure, fear, and expectation of further terrorist plots do not justify, temper, or excuse improper actions taken by individuals or organizations in the name of national security. The major lesson of this report is that regardless of
the pressures and the need to act, the Intelligence Community's actions must always reflect who we are as a nation, and adhere to our laws and standards. It is precisely at these times of national crisis that our government must be guided by the lessons of our history and subject decisions to internal and external review.
Instead, CIA personnel, aided by two outside contractors, decided to initiate a program of indefinite secret detention and the use of brutal interrogation techniques in violation of U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values.

This Conomittee Study documents the abuses and countless mistakes made between late 2001 and early 2009. The Executive Summary of the Study provides

^It is worth repeating that the covert action authorities approved by the President in September 2001 did not provide any authorization or contemplate coercive interrogations.

UNCLASSIFIED

a significant amount of new information, based on CIA and other documents, to what has already been made public by the Bush and Obama Administrations,' as well as non-governmental organizations and the press.

The Committee's full Study is more than ten times the length of the Executive Summary and includes comprehensive and excruciating detail. The Study describes the history of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program from its inception to its termination, including a review of each of the 119 known individuals who were held in CIA custody.

The full Committee Study also provides substantially more detail than what is included in the Executive Summary on the CIA's justification and defense of its interrogation program on the basis that it was necessary and critical to the disruption of specific terrorist plots and the capture of specific terrorists. While the
Executive Summary provides sufficient detail to demonstrate the inaccuracies of each of these claims, the information in the full Committee Study is far more extensive.

I chose not to seek declassification of the full Committee Study at this time. I believe that the Executive Summary includes enough information to adequately describe the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, and the Committee's Findings and Conclusions cover the entirety of the program. Seeking declassification of the more than six thousand page report would have significantly delayed the release of the Executive Summary. Decisions will be made later on the declassification and release of the full 6,700 page Study.

In 2009, when this effort began, I stated (in a press release co-authored with the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kit Bond) that ""the purpose is to review the program and to shape detention and interrogation policies in the future."" The review is now done. It is my sincere and deep hope that through the release of these Findings and Conclusions and Executive Summary that U.S. policy will never again allow for secret indefinite detention and the use of coercive interrogations. As the Study describes, prior to the attacks of September 2001, the CIA itself determined from its own experience with coercive interrogations, that such techniques ""do not produce intelligence,"" ""will probably result in false answers,"" and had historically proven to be ineffective. Yet these conclusions were ignored. We cannot again allow history to be forgotten and grievous past mistakes to be repeated.

President Obama signed Executive Order 13491 in January 2009 to prohibit the CIA from holding detainees other than on a ""short-term, transitory basis"" and to limit interrogation techniques to those includedin the Army Field Manual. However, these limitations are not part of U.S. law and could be overturned by a
future president with the stroke of a pen. They should be enshrined in legislation. Even so, existing U.S. law and treaty obligations should have prevented many of the abuses and mistakes made during this program. While the Office of Legal Counsel found otherwise between 2002 and 2007, it is my personal conclusion that, under any common meaning of the term, CIA detainees were tortured. I also believe that the conditions of confinement and the use of authorized and unauthorized interrogation and conditioning techniques were cruel, inhuman, and degrading. I believe the evidence of this is overwhelming and incontrovertible.

While the Commiittee did not make specific recommendations, several emerge from the Committee's review. The CIA, in its June 2013 response to the Committee's Study from December 2012, has also already made and begun to implement its own recommendations. I intend to work with Senate colleagues to
produce recommendations and to solicit views from the readers of the Committee Study.

I would also like to take this opportunity to describe the process of this study. As noted previously, the Committee approved the Terms of Reference for the Study in March 2009 and began requesting information from the CIA and other federal departments. The Committee, through its staff, had already reviewed in 2008 thousands of CIA cables describing the interrogations of the CIA detainees Abu Zubaydah and 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, whose interrogations were the subject of videotapes that were destroyed by the CIA in 2005.

The 2008 review was complicated by the existence of a Department of Justice investigation, opened by Attorney Geiieral Michael Mukasey, into the destruction of the videotapes and expanded by Attomey General Holder in August 2009. In particular, CIA employees and contractors who would otherwise have been interviewed by the Committee staff were under potential legal jeopardy, and therefore the CIA would not compel its workforce to appear before the Committee. This constraint lasted until the Committee's research and documentary review
were completed and the Committee Study had largely been finalized.

Furthermore, given the volume and internal nature of relevant CIA documents, the CIA insisted that the Committee enter into an arrangement where our staff would review documents and conduct research at aCIA-leased facility rather than at the Committee's offices on Capitol Hill. From early 2009 to late 2012, a small group of Committee staff reviewed the more than six million pages of CIA materials, to include operational cables, intelligence reports, internal memoranda and emails, briefing materials, interview transcripts, contracts, and other records. Draft sections of the Study were prepared and distributed to the full Committee membership beginning in October 2011 and this process continued through to the Committee's vote to approve the full Committee Study on December 13, 2012.

The breadth of documentary material onwhich the Study relied and which the Committee Study cites is unprecedented. While the Committee did not interview CIA officials in the context of the Committee Study, it had access to and drew from the interviews ofnumerous CIA officials conducted by the CIA's Inspector General and the CIA Oral History program on subjects that lie at the heart of the Committee Study, as well as past testimony to the Committee.

Following the December 2012 vote, the Committee Study was sent to the President and appropriate parts of the Executive Branch for comments by February 15, 2013. The CIA responded in late June 2013 with extensive comments on the Findings and Conclusions, based in part on the responses of CIA officials involved in the
program. At my direction, the Committee staff met with CIA representatives in order to fully understand the CIA's comments, and then incorporated suggested edits or comments as appropriate.

The Committee Study, including the now-declassified Executive Summary and Findings and Conclusions, as updated is now final and represents the official views of the Committee. This and future Administrations should use this Study to guide future programs, correct past mistakes, increase oversight of CIA representations to policymakers, and ensure coercive interrogation practices are not used by our government again.

Finally, I want to recognize the members of the staff who have endured years of long hours poring through the difficult details of one of the lowest points in our nation's history. They have produced the most significant and comprehensive oversight report in the Committee's history, and perhaps in that of the U.S. Senate, and their contributions should be recognized and praised.

The Committee makes the following findings and conclusions:

#1: The CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.

The Committee finds, based on a review of CIA interrogation records, that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information or gaining detainee cooperation.

For example, according to CIA records, seven of the 39 CIA detainees known to have been subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques produced no intelligence while in CIA custody.* CIA detainees who were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were usually subjected to the techniques immediately after being rendered to CIA custody. Other detainees provided significant accurate intelligence prior to, or without having been subjected to these techniques.

While being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and afterwards, multiple CIA detainees fabricated information, resulting in faulty intelligence. Detainees provided
fabricated information on critical intelligence issues, including the terrorist threats which the CIA identified as its highest priorities.

At numerous times throughout the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, CIA personnel assessed that the most effective method for acquiring intelligence from detainees, including from detainees the CIA considered to be the most ""high-value,"" was to confront the detainees with information already acquired by the Intelligence Community. CIA officers regularly called into question whether the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were effective, assessing that the use of the techniques failed to elicit detainee cooperation or produce accurate intelligence.

#2: The CIA's justification for the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques rested on inaccurate claims of their effectiveness.

The CIA represented to the White House, the National Security Council, the Department of Justice, the CIA Office of Inspector General, the Congress, and the public that the best measure of effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was examples of specific terrorist plots ""thwarted"" and specific terrorists captured as a result of the use of the techniques. The CIA used these examples to claim that its enhanced interrogation techniques were not only effective, but also necessary to acquire ""otherwise unavailable"" actionable intelligence that ""saved lives.""

The Committee reviewed 20 of the most frequent and prominent examples of purported counterterrorism successes that the CIA has attributed to the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques, and found them to be wrong in fundamental respects. In some cases, there was no relationship between the cited counterterrorism success and any information provided by
detainees during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. In the

Kll

II III I

Page 2 of 19
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

remaining cases, the CIA inaccurately claimed that specific, otherwise unavailable information was acquired from a CIA detainee ""as a result"" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, when in fact the information was either: (1) corroborative of information already available to the CIA or other elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community from sources other than the CIA detainee, and was therefore not ""otherwise unavailable""; or (2) acquired from the CIA detainee prior to the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The examples provided by the CIA included numerous factual inaccuracies.

In providing the ""effectiveness"" examples to policymakers, the Department of Justice, and others, the CIA consistently omitted the significant amount of relevant intelligence obtained from sources other than CIA detainees who had been subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques—leaving the false impression the CIA was acquiring unique information from the use of the techniques.

Some of the plots that the CIA claimed to have ""disrupted"" as a result of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were assessed by intelligence and law enforcement officials as being
infeasible or ideas that were never operationalized.

#3: The interrogations of CIA detainees were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others.

Beginning with the CIA's first detainee, Abu Zubaydah, and continuing with numerous others, the CIA applied its enhanced interrogation techniques with significant repetition for days or
weeks at a time. Interrogation techniques such as slaps and ""wallings"" (slamming detainees against a wall) were used in combination, frequently concurrent with sleep deprivation and
nudity. Records do not support CIA representations that the CIA initially used an ""an open, non-threatening approach,""^ or that interrogations began with the ""least coercive technique possible""^
and escalated to more coercive techniques only as necessary.

The waterboarding technique was physically harmful, inducing convulsions and vomiting. Abu Zubaydah, for example, became ""completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open,
full mouth.'""^ Internal CIA records describe the waterboarding of Khalid Shaykh Mohammad as evolving into a ""series of near drownings.""^

Sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours, usually standing or in stress positions, at times with their hands shackled above their heads. At least five detainees
experienced disturbing hallucinations during prolonged sleep deprivation and, in at least two of those cases, the CIA nonetheless continued the sleep deprivation.

Contrary to CIA representations to the Department of Justice, the CIA instructed personnel that the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah would take ""precedence"" over his medical care,^ resulting in
the deterioration of a bullet wound Abu Zubaydah incurred during his capture. In at least two other cases, the CIA used its enhanced interrogation techniques despite warnings from CIA medical personnel that the techniques could exacerbate physical injuries. CIA medical personnel

treated at least one detainee for swelling in order to allow the continued use of standing sleep deprivation.

At least five CIA detainees were subjectedto ""rectal rehydration"" or rectal feeding without documented medical necessity. The CIA placed detainees in ice water ""baths."" The CIA led several detainees to believe they would never be allowed to leave CIA custody alive, suggesting to one detainee that he would only leave in a coffin-shaped box.^ One interrogator told another detainee that he would never go to court, because ""we can never let the world know what I have done to you.""^ CIA officers also threatened at least three detainees with harm to their families—to include threats to harm the children of a detainee, threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee, and a threat to ""cut [a detainee's] mother's throat.""^

#4: The conditions of confinement for CIA detainees were harsher than the CIA had represented to policymakers and others.

Conditions at CIA detention sites were poor, and were especially bleak early in the program. CIA detainees at the COBALT detention facility were kept in complete darkness and constantly shackled in isolated cells with loud noise or music and only a bucket to use for human waste. Lack of heat at the facility likely contributed to the death of a detainee. The chief of interrogations described COBALT as a ""dungeon.""^^ Another seniorCIA officer stated that COBALT was itself an enhanced interrogation technique.^'

At times, the detainees at COBALT were walked around naked or were shackled with their hands above their heads for extended periods of time. Other times, the detainees at COBALT were subjected to what was described as a ""rough takedown,"" in which approximately five CIA officers would scream at a detainee, drag him outside of his cell, cut his clothes off, and secure him with Mylar tape. The detainee would then be hooded and dragged up and down a long corridor while being slapped and punched.

Even after the conditions of confinement improved with the construction of new detention facilities, detainees were held in total isolation except when being interrogated or debriefed by
CIA personnel.

Throughout the program, multiple CIA detainees who were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and extended isolation exhibited psychological and behavioral issues,
including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation. Multiple psychologists identified the lack of human contact experienced by detainees as a cause of psychiatric problems.

#5: The CIA repeatedly provided inaccurate information to the Department of Justice, impeding a proper legal analysis of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

From 2002 to 2007, the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) within the Department of Justice relied on CIA representations regarding: (1) the conditions of confinement for detainees, (2) the

Kli

'iM III 1

Page 4 of 19
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

application of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, (3) the physical effects of the techniques on detainees, and (4) the effectiveness of the techniques. Those representations were
inaccurate in material respects.

The Department of Justice did not conduct independent analysis or verification of the information it received from the CIA. The department warned, however, that if the facts provided by the CIA were to change, its legal conclusions might not apply. When the CIA
determined that information it had provided to the Department of Justice was incorrect, the CIA rarely informed the department.

Prior to the initiation of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program and throughout the life of the program, the legal justifications for the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques relied on the CIA's claim that the techniques were necessary to save lives. In late 2001 and early 2002, senior attorneys at the CIA Office of General Counsel first examined the legal implications of using coercive interrogation techniques. CIA attorneys stated that ""a novel application of the necessity defense"" could be used ""to avoid prosecution of U.S. officials who tortured to obtain information that saved many lives.""^^^

Having reviewed information provided by the CIA, the OLC included the ""necessity defense"" in its August 1, 2002, memorandum to the White House counsel on Standards of Conduct for Interrogation. The OLC determined that ""under the current circumstances, necessity or self-defense may justify interrogation methods that might violate"" the criminal prohibition against torture.

On the same day, a second OLC opinion approved, for the first time, the use of 10 specific coercive interrogation techniques against Abu Zubaydah—subsequently referred to as the CIA's ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" The OLC relied on inaccurate CIA representations about Abu Zubaydah's status in al-Qa'ida and the interrogation team's ""certain[ty]"" that Abu Zubaydah was withholding information about planned terrorist attacks. The CIA's
representations to the OLC about the techniques were also inconsistent with how the techniques would later be applied.

In March 2005, the CIA submitted to the Department of Justice various examples of the ""effectiveness"" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques that were inaccurate. OLC memoranda signed on May 30, 2005, and July 20, 2007, relied on these representations, determining that the techniques were legal in part because they produced ""specific, actionable intelligence"" and ""substantial quantities of otherwise unavailable intelligence"" that saved lives.

#6: The CIA has actively avoided or impeded congressional oversight of the program.

The CIA did not brief the leadership of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques until September 2002, after the techniques had been
approved and used. The CIA did not respond to Chairman Bob Graham's requests for additional information in 2002, noting in its own internal communications that he would be leaving the
Committee in Januai-y 2003. The CIA subsequently resisted efforts by Vice Chairman John D.

Rockefeller IV, to investigate the program, including by refusing in 2006 to provide requested documents to the full Committee.

The CIA restricted access to information about the program from members of the Committee beyond the chairman and vice chairman until September 6, 2006, the day the president publicly
acknowledged the program, by which time 117 of the 119 known detainees had already entered CIA custody. Until then, the CIA had declined to answer questions from other Committee members that related to CIA interrogation activities.

Prior to September 6, 2006, the CIA provided inaccurate information to the leadership of the Committee. Briefings to the full Conmiittee beginning on September 6, 2006, also contained
numerous inaccuracies, including inaccurate descriptions of how interrogation techniques were applied and what information was obtained from CIA detainees. The CIA misrepresented the views of members of Congress on a number of occasions. After multiple senators had been critical of the program and written letters expressing concerns to CIA Director Michael Hayden, Director Hayden nonetheless told a meeting of foreign ambassadors to the United States that every Committee member was ""fully briefed,"" and that ""[t]his is not CIA's program. This is not the President's program. This is America's program.""^^ The CIA also provided inaccurate information describing the views of U.S. senators about the program to the Department of Justice.

A year after being briefed on the program, the House and Senate Conference Committee considering the Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization bill voted to limit the CIA to using
only interrogation techniques authorized by the Army Field Manual. That legislation was approved by the Senate and the House of Representatives in February 2008, and was vetoed by President Bush on March 8, 2008.

#7: The CIA impeded effective White House oversight and decision-making.

The CIA provided extensive amounts of inaccurate and incomplete information related to the operation and effectiveness of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to the White House, the National Security Council principals, and their staffs. This prevented an accurate and complete understanding of the program by Executive Branch officials, thereby impeding oversight and decision-making.

According to CIA records, no CIA officer, up to and including CIA Directors George Tenet and Porter Goss, briefed the president on the specific CIA enhanced interrogation techniques before
April 2006. By that time, 38 of the 39 detainees identified as having been subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques had already been subjected to the techniques. The CIA did not inform the president or vice president of the location of CIA detention facilities other than Country.

At the direction of the White House, the secretaries of state and defense - both principals on the National Security Council - were not briefed on program specifics until September 2003. An internal CIA email from July 2003 noted that ""... the WH [White House] is extremely concerned

[Secretary] Powell would blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what's been going on.""^^ Deputy Secretary of State Armitage complained that he and Secretary Powell were ""cut out"" of the National Security Council coordination process.^^

The CIA repeatedly provided incomplete and inaccurate information to White House personnel regarding the operation and effectiveness of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. This includes the provision of inaccurate statements similar to those provided to other elements of the U.S. Government and later to the public, as well as instances in which specific questions from White House officials were not answered truthfully or fully. In briefings for the National Security Council principals and White House officials, the CIA advocated for the continued use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, warning that ""[tjermination of this program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive.""^^

#8: The CIA's operation and management of the program complicated, and in some cases impeded, the national security missions of other Executive Branch agencies.

The CIA, in the conduct of its Detention and Interrogation Program, complicated, and in some cases impeded, the national security missions of other Executive Branch agencies, including the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the State Department, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The CIA withheld or restricted information relevant to these agencies' missions and responsibilities, denied access to detainees, and provided inaccurate information on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to these agencies.

The use of coercive interrogation techniques and covert detention facilities that did not meet traditional U.S. standards resulted in the FBI and the Department of Defense limiting their involvement in CIA interrogation and detention activities. This reduced the ability of the U.S. Government to deploy available resources and expert personnel to interrogate detainees and operate detention facilities. The CIA denied specific requests from FBI Director Robert Mueller III for FBI access to CIA detainees that the FBI believed was necessary to understand CIA detainee reporting on threats to the U.S. Homeland. Information obtained from CIA detainees was restricted within the Intelhgence Community, leading to concerns among senior CIA officers that Hmitations on sharing information undermined government-wide counterterrorism analysis.

The CIA blocked State Department leadership from access to information crucial to foreign
policy decision-making and diplomatic activities. The CIA did not inform two secretaries of
state of locations of CIA detention facilities, despite the significant foreign policy implications
related to the hosting of clandestine CIA detention sites and the fact that the political leaders of
host countries were generally informed of their existence. Moreover, CIA officers told U.S.
ambassadors not to discuss the CIA program with State Department officials, preventing the
ambassadors from seeking guidance on the policy implications of establishing CIA detention
facilities in the countries in which they served.
In two countries, U.S. ambassadors were informed of plans to establish a CIA detention site in
the countries where they were serving after the CIA had already entered into agreements with the

11 III I

countries to host the detention sites. In two other countries where negotiations on hosting new
CIA detention facilities were taking place,the CIA told local government officials not to
inform the U.S. ambassadors.

The ODNI was providedwith inaccurate and incomplete information about the program,
preventing the director of national intelligencefrom effectively carrying out the director's
statutory responsibility to serve as the principal advisor to the president on intelligence matters.
The inaccurate information provided to the ODNI by the CIA resulted in the ODNI releasing
inaccurate information to the public in September 2006.

#9; The CIA impeded oversight by the CIA's Office of Inspector General.
The CIA avoided, resisted, and otherwise impeded oversight of the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program by the CIA's Office oHnspector General (OIG). The CIA did not brief
the OIG on the program until after the death of a detainee, by which time the CIA had held at
least 22 detainees at two different CIA detention sites. Once notified, the OIG reviewed the

CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program and issued several reports, including an important
May 2004 ""Special Review"" of the program that identified significant concerns and deficiencies.
During the OIG reviews, CIA personnel provided OIG with inaccurate information on the
operation and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, as well as on the
effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. The inaccurate information was
included in the final May 2004 Special Review, which was later declassified and released
publicly, and remains uncorrected.

In 2005, CIA Director Goss requested in writing that the inspector general not initiate further
reviews of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program until reviews already underway were
completed. In 2007, Director Hayden ordered an unprecedented review of the OIG itself in
response to the OIG's inquiries into the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

#10: The CIA coordinated the release of classified information to the media, including
inaccurate information concerning the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques.
The CIA's Office of Public Affairs and senior CIA officials coordinated to share classified

information on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to select members of the media to
counter public criticism, shape public opinion, and avoid potential congressional action to restrict
the CIA's detention and inteiTogation authorities and budget. These disclosures occurred when
the program was a classified covert action program, and before the CIA had briefed the full
Committee membership on the program.

The deputy director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center wrote to a colleague in 2005, shortly
before being interviewed by a media outlet, that ""we either get out and sell, or we get hammered,
which has implications beyond the media. [C]ongress reads it, cuts our authorities, messes up

nil

our budget... we either put out our story or wegeteaten. [T]here is no middle ground.""^ The
same CIA officer explained to a colleague that ""when the [Washington Post]/[New York Tjimes
quotes 'senior intelligence official,' it's us... authorized and directed by opa [CIA's Office of
Public Affairs].

Much of the information the CIA provided to the media on the operation of the CIA's Detention
and Interrogation Program and the effectiveness of its enhanced inteiTogation techniques was
inaccurate and was similar to the inaccurate information provided by the CIA to the Congress,
the Department of Justice, and the White House.

#11: The CIA was unprepared as it began operating its Detention and Interrogation
Program more than six months after being granted detention authorities.
On September 17, 2001, the President signed a covert action Memorandum of Notification
(MON) granting the CIA unprecedented counterterrorism authorities, including the authority to
covertly capture and detain individuals ""posing a continuing, serious threat of violence or death
to U.S. persons and interests or planning terrorist activities."" The MON made no reference to
interrogations or coercive interrogation techniques.
The CIA was not prepared to take custody of its first detainee. In the fall of 2001, the CIA
explored the possibility of establishing clandestine detention facilities in several countries. The
CIA's review identified risks associated with clandestine detention that led it to conclude that

U.S. military bases were the best option for the CIA to detain individuals under the MON
authorities. In late March 2002, the imminent capture of Abu Zubaydah prompted the CIA to
again consider various detention options. In part to avoid declaring Abu Zubaydah to the
International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be required if he were detained at a U.S.
militaiy base, the CIA decided to seek authorization to clandestinely detain Abu Zubaydah at a

facility inCountry  —a country that had not previously been considered as a potential host for a
CIA detention site. A senior CIA officer indicated that the CIA ""will have to acknowledge

certain gaps in ourplanning/preparations,""""^ butstated that this plan would be presented to the
president. At a Presidential Daily Briefing session that day, the president approved CIA's

proposal to detain Abu Zubaydah in Country  .
The CIA lacked a plan for the eventual disposition of its detainees. After taking custody of Abu
Zubaydah, CIA officers concluded that he ""should remain incommunicado for the remainder of
his life,"" which ""may preclude [Abu Zubaydah] from being turned over to another country.
The CIA did not review its past experience with coercive interrogations, or its previous statement
to Congress that ""inhumane physical or psychological techniques are counterproductive because

they do not produce intelligence and will probably result in false answers.""-^ The CIA also did
not contact other elements of the U.S. Government with interrogation expertise.

In July 2002, on the basis of consultations with contract psychologists, and with very limited
internal deliberation, the CIA requested approval from the Department of Justice to use a set of
coercive interrogation techniques. The techniques were adapted from the training of U.S.

Page 9 of 19

military personnel at the U.S. Air Force Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE)
school, which was designed to prepare U.S. military personnel for the conditions and treatment
to which they might be subjected if taken prisoner by countries that do not adhere to the Geneva
Conventions.

As it began detention and interrogation operations, the CIA deployed personnel who lacked
relevant training and experience. The CIA began interrogation training more than seven months
after taking custody of Abu Zubaydah, and more than thi'ee months after the CIA began using its
""enhanced inteiTogation techniques."" CIA Director George Tenet issued formal guidelines for
interrogations and conditions of confinement at detention sites in January 2003, by which time
40 of the 119 known detainees had been detained by the CIA.

#12: The CIA's management and operation of its Detention and Interrogation Program
was deeply flawed throughout the program's duration, particularly so in 2002 and early
2003.

The CIA's COBALT detention facility in Country   began operations inSeptember 2002 and
ultimately housed more than half of the 119 CIA detainees identified in this Study. The CIA
kept few formal records of the detainees in its custody at COBALT. Untrained CIA officers at
the facility conducted frequent, unauthorized, and unsupervised interrogations of detainees using
harsh physical interrogation techniques that were not—and never became—part of the CIA's

formal ""enhanced"" interrogation program. The CI^)laced ajunior officer with no relevant
experience in charge of COBALT. On November jf, 2002, adetainee who had been held
partially nude and chained to a concrete floor died from suspected hypothermia at the facility.
At the time, no single unit at CIA Headquarters had clear responsibility for CIA detention and
interrogation operations. In interviews conducted in 2003 with the Office of Inspector General,
CIA's leadership and senior attorneys acknowledged that they had little or no awareness of
operations at COBALT, and some believed that enhanced interrogation techniques were not used
there.

Although CIA Director Tenet in January 2003 issued guidance for detention and interrogation
activities, serious management problems persisted. For example, in December 2003, CIA
personnel reported that they had made the ""unsettling discovery"" that the CIA had been ""holding
a number of detainees about whom"" the CIA knew ""very litde"" at multiple detention sites in

Country i.-'
Divergent lines of authority for interrogationactivities persisted through at least 2003. Tensions
among interrogators extended to complaints about the safety and effectiveness of each other's
interrogation practices.

The CIA placed individuals with no applicable experience or training in senior detention and
interrogation roles, and providedinadequate linguistic and analytical support to conduct effective
questioning of CIA detainees, resulting in diminished intelligence. The lack of CIA personnel
available to question detainees, which the CIA inspector general referred to as ""an ongoing
problem,persisted throughout the program.

In 2005, the chief of the CIA's BLACK detention site, where many of the detainees the CIA
assessed as ""high-value"" were held, complained that CIA Headquarters ""managers seem to be
selecting either problem, underperforming officers, new, totally inexperienced officers or

whomever seems to be willing and able to deploy at any given time,"" resulting in ""the production
of mediocre or, I dare say, useless intelligence.
Numerous CIA officers had serious documented personal and professional problems—including
histories of violence and records of abusive ti'eatment of others—that should have called into

question their suitability to participatein the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, their
employment with the CIA, and their continued access to classified information. In nearly all
cases, these problems were known to the CIA prior to the assignment of these officers to
detention and interrogation positions.

#13: Two contract psychologists devised the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and
played a central role in the operation, assessments, and management of the CIA's
Detention and Interrogation Program. By 2005, the CIA had overwhelmingly outsourced
operations related to the program.

The CIA contracted with two psychologists to develop, operate, and assess its interrogation
operations. The psychologists' prior experience was at the U.S. Air Force Survival, Evasion,
Resistance and Escape (SERE) school. Neither psychologist had any experience as an
interrogator, nor did either have specialized knowledge of al-Qa'ida, a background in
counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise.
On the CIA's behalf, the contract psychologists developed theories of interrogation based on

""learned helplessness,""^^ and developed the list of enhanced inteiTogation techniques that was
approved for use against Abu Zubaydah and subsequent CIA detainees. The psychologists
personally conducted interrogations of some of the CIA's most significant detainees using these
techniques. They also evaluated whether detainees' psychological state allowed for the
continued use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, including some detainees whom
they were themselves interrogating or had interrogated. The psychologists carried out inherently
governmental functions, such as acting as liaison between the CIA and foreign intelligence
services, assessing the effectiveness of the interrogation program, and participating in the
interrogation of detainees in held in foreign government custody.
In 2005, the psychologists formed a company specifically for the purpose of conducting their
work with the CIA. Shortly thereafter, the CIA outsourced vktually all aspects of the program.
In 2006, the value of the CIA's base conti""act with the company formed by the psychologists with

all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; the contractors received $81 million prior to
the contract's termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification
agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the

program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement.

In 2008, the CIA's Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation Group, the lead unit for detention and

interrogation opera^ns at the CIA, had atotal of
staff officers and

positions, which were filled with   CIA

contractors, meaning that contractors made up 85% of the workforce for

detention and interrogation operations.

#14: CIA detainees were subjected to coercive interrogation techniques that had not been
approved by the Department of Justice or had not been authorized by CIA Headquarters.
Prior to mid-2004, the CIA routinely subjected detainees to nudity and dietary manipulation.
The CIA also used abdominal slaps and cold water dousing on several detainees during that
period. None of these techniques had been approved by the Department of Justice.
At least 17 detainees were subjected to CIA enhanced interrogation techniques without
authorization from CIA Headquarters. Additionally, multiple detainees were subjected to
techniques that were applied in ways that diverged from the specific authorization, or were
subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators who had not been authorized to
use them. Although these incidents were recorded in CIA cables and, in at least some cases were
identified at the time by supervisors at CIA Headquarters as being inappropriate, corrective
action was rarely taken against the interrogators involved.

#15: The CIA did not conduct a comprehensive or accurate accounting of the number of
individuals it detained, and held individuals who did not meet the legal standard for
detention. The CIA's claims about the number of detainees held and subjected to its
enhanced Interrogation techniques were inaccurate.

The CIA never conducted a comprehensive audit or developed a complete and accurate list of the
individuals it had detained or subjected to its enhanced interrogation techniques. CIA statements
to the Committee and later to the public that the CIA detained fewer than 100 individuals, and

that less than a third of those 100 detainees were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, were inaccurate. The Committee's review of CIA records determined that the CIA

detained at least 119 individuals, of whom at least 39 were subjected to the CIA's enhanced
interrogation techniques.
Of the 119 known detainees, at least 26 were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention
standard in the September 2001 Memorandum of Notification (MON). These included an
""intellectually challenged"" man whose CIA detention was used solely as leverage to get a family
member to provide information, two individuals who were intelligence sources for foreign
liaison services and were former CIA sources, and two individuals whom the CIA assessed to be

connected to al-Qa'ida based solely on information fabricated by a CIA detainee subjected to the
CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. Detainees often remained in custody for months after
the CIA determined that they did not meet the MON standard. CIA records provide insufficient
information to justify the detention of many other detainees.

CIA Headquarters instructed that at least four CIA detainees be placed in host country detention
facilities because the individuals did not meet the MON standard for CIA detention. The host

country had no independent reason to hold the detainees.

A full accounting of CIA detentions and interrogations may be impossible, as records in some
cases are non-existent, and, in many other cases, are spai'se and insufficient. There were almost
no detailed records of the detentions and interrogations at the CIA's COBALT detention facility
in 2002, and almost no such records for the CIA's GRAY detention site, also in Country

At

CIA detention facilities outside of Country
the CIA kept increasingly less-detailed records of
its interrogation activities over the course of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

#16: The CIA failed to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of its enhanced interrogation
techniques.

The CIA never conducted a credible, comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of its enhanced
interrogation techniques, despite a recommendation by the CIA inspector general and similar
requests by the national security advisor and the leadership of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence.
Internal assessments of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program were conducted by CIA
personnel who participated in the development and management of the program, as well as by
CIA contractors who had a financial interest in its continuation and expansion. An ""informal
operational assessment"" of the program, led by two senior CIA officers who were not part of the
CIA's Counterterrorism Center, determined that it would not be possible to assess the
effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques without violating ""Federal Policy
for the Protection of Human Subjects"" regarding human experimentation. The CIA officers,
whose review relied on briefings with CIA officers and contractors running the program,
concluded only that the ""CIA Detainee Program"" was a ""success"" without addressing the

effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques.^^
In 2005, in response to the recommendation by the inspector general for a review of the
effectiveness of each of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the CIA asked two
individuals not employed by the CIA to conduct a broader review of ""the entirety of the

""rendition, detention and interrogation program.""^""^ According to one individual, the review was
""heavily reliant on the willingness of [CIA CounterteiTorism Center] staff to provide us with the
factual material that forms the basis of our conclusions."" That individual acknowledged lacking
the requisite expertise to review the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation
techniques, and concluded only that ""the program,"" meaning all CIA detainee reporting
regardless of whether it was connected to the use of the CIA's enhanced inteiTogation

techniques, was a ""great success.""^'' The second reviewer concluded that ""there is no objective
way to answer the question of efficacy"" of the techniques.
There are no CIA records to indicate that any of the reviews independently validated the
""effectiveness"" claims presented by the CIA, to include basic confirmation that the intelligence
cited by the CIA was acquired from CIA detainees during or after the use of the CIA's enhanced

II III I

interrogation techniques. Nor did the reviews seek to confirm whether the intelligence cited by
the CIA as being obtained ""as a result"" of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was
unique and ""otherwise unavailable,"" as claimed by the CIA, and not previously obtainedfrom
other sources.

#17: The CIA rarely reprimanded or held personnel accountable for serious and
significant violations, inappropriate activities, and systemic and individual management
failures.

CIA officers and CIA contractors who were found to have violated CIA policies or performed
poorly were rarely held accountable or removed from positions of responsibility.
Significant events, to include the death and injury of CIA detainees, the detention of individuals
who did not meet the legal standard to be held, the use of unauthorized interrogation techniques
against CIA detainees, and the provision of inaccurate information on the CIA program did not
result in appropriate, effective, or in many eases, any corrective actions. CIA managers who
were aware of failings and shortcomings in the program but did not intervene, or who failed to
provide proper leadership and management, were also not held to account.

On two occasions in which the CIA inspector general identified wrongdoing, accountability
recommendations were ovennled by senior CIA leadership. In one instance, involving the death
of a CIA detainee at COBALT, CIA Headquarters decided not to take disciplinary action against
an officer involved because, at the time, CIA Headquarters had been ""motivated to extract any

and all operational information"" from the detainee.^^ In another instance related to a wrongful
detention, no action was taken against a CIA officer because, ""[t]he Director strongly believes
that mistakes should be expected in a business filled with uncertainty,"" and ""the Director
believes the scale tips decisively in favor of accepting mistakes that over connect the dots against

those thatunder connect them.""^^ In neither case was administrative action taken against CIA
management personnel.

#18: The CIA marginalized and ignored numerous internal critiques, criticisms, and
objections concerning the operation and management of the CIA's Detention and
Interrogation Program.

Critiques, criticisms, and objections were expressed by numerous CIA officers, including senior
personnel overseeing and managing the program, as well as analysts, interrogators, and medical
officers involved in or supporting CIA detention and interrogation operations.
Examples of these concerns include CIA officers questioning the effectiveness of the CIA's

enhanced interrogation techniques, interrogators disagreeing with the use of such techniques
against detainees whom they determined were not withholding information, psychologists
recommending less isolated conditions, and Office of Medical Services personnel questioning
both the effectiveness and safety of the techniques. These concerns were regularly overridden by
CIA management, and the CIA made few corrective changes to its policies governing the
1(11 'iM III I

(HIN

UNCLASSIFIED

program. At times, CIA officers were instructed by supervisors not to put their concerns or
observations in written communications.

In several instances, CIA officers identified inaccuracies in CIA representations about the

program and its effectiveness to the Office of Inspector General, the White House, the
Department of Justice, the Congress, and the American public. The CIA nonetheless failed to
take action to correct these representations, and allowed inaccurate information to remain as the
CIA's official position.
The CIA was also resistant to, and highly critical of more formal critiques. The deputy director
for operations stated that the CIA inspector general's draft Special Review should have come to

the ""conclusion that our efforts have thwarted attacks and saved lives,""^^ while the CIA general
counsel accused the inspector general of presenting ""an imbalanced and inaccurate picmre"" of

the program.'^^ A February 2007 report from the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), which the CIA acting general counsel initially stated ""actually does not sound that far
removed from the realitywas also criticized. CIA officers prepared documents indicating
that ""critical portions of the Report are patently false or misleading, especially certain key factual
claims..CIA Director Hayden testified to the Committee that ""numerous false allegations of
physical and threatened abuse and faulty legal assumptions and analysis in the [ICRC] report

undermine its overall credibility.'""^^
#19; The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program was inherently unsustainable and
had effectively ended by 2006 due to unauthorized press disclosures, reduced cooperation
from other nations, and legal and oversight concerns.

The CIA required secrecy and cooperation from other nations in order to operate clandestine
detention facilities, and both had eroded significantly before President Bush publicly disclosed
the program on September 6, 2006. From the beginning of the program, the CIA faced
significant challenges in finding nations willing to host CIA clandestine detention sites. These
challenges became increasingly difficult over time. With the exception of Country
the CIA
was forced to relocate detainees out of every country in which it established a detention facility
because of pressure from the host government or public revelations about the program.
Beginning in early 2005, the CIA sought unsuccessfully to convince the U.S. Department of
Defense to allow the transfer of numerous CIA detainees to U.S. military custody. By 2006, the
CIA admitted in its own talking points for CIA Director Porter Goss that, absent an
Administration decision on an ""endgame"" for detainees, the CIA was ""stymied"" and ""the

program could collapse of its own weight.""""^
Lack of access to adequate medical care for detainees in countries hosting the CIA's detention
facilities caused recunring problems. The refusal of one host country to admit a severely ill
detainee into a local hospital due to security concerns contributed to the closing of the CIA's
detention facility in that country. The U.S. Department of Defense also declined to provide
medical care to detainees upon CIA request.

1(11 III ( III I

In mid-2003, a statement by the president for the United Nations International Day in Support of
Victims of Torture and a pubHc statement by the White House thatprisoners in U.S. custody are
treated ""humanely"" caused the CIA to question whether there was continued policy support for
the program and seek reauthorization from the White House. In mid-2004, the CIA temporarily
suspended the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques after the CIA inspector general
recommended that the CIA seek an updated legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel. In
early 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court decision to grant certiorari in the case of Rasul v. Bush
prompted the CIA to move detainees out of a CIA detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
In late 2005 and in 2006, the Detainee Treatment Act and then the U.S. Supreme Couit decision
in Hamdan v. Rumsfeldcaused the CIA to again temporarily suspend the use of its enhanced
interrogation techniques.

By 2006, press disclosures, the unwillingness of other countries to host existing or new detention
sites, and legal and oversight concerns had largely ended the CIA's ability to operate clandestine
detention facilities.

After detaining at least 113 individuals through 2004, the CIA brought only six additional
detainees into its custody: four in 2005, one in 2006, and one in 2007. By March 2006, the
program was operating in only one country. The CIA last used its enhanced interrogation
techniques on November 8, 2007. The CIA did not hold any detainees after April 2008.

#20; The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program damaged the United States'
standing in the world, and resulted in other significant monetary and non-monetary costs.
The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Pi-ogram created tensions with U.S. partners and allies,
leading to formal demarches to the United States, and damaging and complicating bilateral
inteUigence relationships.

In one example, inJune 2004, the secretary ofstate ordered the U.S. ambassador inCountry   to

deliver ademarche to CounteyB/li^ssence demanding [Country   Government] provide full

access to all [Country
detainees"" to the International Committee ofthe Red
Cross. At the time, however, the detainees Country   was holding included detainees being held
in secret at the CIA's behest.""^^

More broadly, the program caused immeasurable damage to the United States' public standing,
as well as to the United States' longstanding global leadership on human rights in general and the
prevention of torture in particular.

CIA records indicate that the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program cost well over $300
million in non-personnel costs. This included funding for the CIA to construct and maintain

detention facilities, including two facilities costing nearly $  million that were never used, in
part due to host country political concerns.

To encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for
existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government

DIRECTOR ••

(152227Z MAR 07)

The Committee's conclusion is basedon CIA records, including statements from CIA DirectorsGeorge Tenet and
PorterGoss to the CIA inspector general, that the directors had not briefed the president on the CIA's interrogation
program. According to CIA records, when briefed in April 2006, the president expressed discomfort with the
""image of a detainee, chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself."" The

CIA's June 2013 Response does not dispute the CIA records, but states that ""[w]hile Agencyrecords on the subject
are admittedly incomplete, fonner President Bushhas stated in his autobiography that he discussed the program,
including the use of enhanced techniques, withthen-DCIA Tenetin 2002, prior to application of the techniques on
Abu Zubaydah, and personally approved tlie techniques."" A memoir by fonner Acting CIA General Counsel John
Rizzo disputes this account.
CIA records indicate that the CIA had not informed policymakers of the presence of CIA detention facilities in

Countries

,   and  . It is less clear whether policymakers were aware of the detention facilities in Country

and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The CIA requested that country names and infonnation directly or indirectly

03)",United States Senate,1967,[92],1
91,Mellow Moonlight,"        This Venice, which was a haughty, invincible, magnificent Republic for nearly fourteen hundred years; whose armies compelled the world's applause whenever and wherever they battled; whose navies well nigh held dominion of the seas, and whose merchant fleets whitened the remotest oceans with their sails and loaded these piers with the products of every clime, is fallen a prey to poverty, neglect and melancholy decay. Six hundred years ago, Venice was the Autocrat of Commerce; her mart was the great commercial centre, the distributing-house from whence the enormous trade of the Orient was spread abroad over the Western world. To-day her piers are deserted, her warehouses are empty, her merchant fleets are vanished, her armies and her navies are but memories. Her glory is departed, and with her crumbling grandeur of wharves and palaces about her she sits among her stagnant lagoons, forlorn and beggared, forgotten of the world. She that in her palmy days commanded the commerce of a hemisphere and made the weal or woe of nations with a beck of her puissant finger, is become the humblest among the peoples of the earth,--a peddler of glass beads for women, and trifling toys and trinkets for school-girls and children.

        The venerable Mother of the Republics is scarce a fit subject for flippant speech or the idle gossipping of tourists. It seems a sort of sacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance that pictures her to us softly from afar off as through a tinted mist, and curtains her ruin and her desolation from our view. One ought, indeed, to turn away from her rags, her poverty and her humiliation, and think of her only as she was when she sunk the fleets of Charlemagne; when she humbled Frederick Barbarossa or waved her victorious banners above the battlements of Constantinople.

        We reached Venice at eight in the evening, and entered a hearse belonging to the Grand Hotel d'Europe. At any rate, it was more like a hearse than any thing else, though to speak by the card, it was a gondola. And this was the storied gondola of Venice!--the fairy boat in which the princely cavaliers of the olden time were won't to cleave the waters of the moonlit canals and look the eloquence of love into the soft eyes of patrician beauties, while the gay gondolier in silken doublet touched his guitar and sang as only gondoliers can sing! This the famed gondola and this the gorgeous gondolier!--the one an inky, rusty old canoe with a sable hearse-body clapped on to the middle of it, and the other a mangy, barefooted guttersnipe with a portion of his raiment on exhibition which should have been sacred from public scrutiny. Presently, as he turned a corner and shot his hearse into a dismal ditch between two long rows of towering, untenanted buildings, the gay gondolier began to sing, true to the traditions of his race. I stood it a little while. Then I said:

        ""Now, here, Roderigo Gonzales Michael Angelo, I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger, but I am not going to have my feelings lacerated by any such caterwauling as that. If that goes on, one of us has got to take water. It is enough that my cherished dreams of Venice have been blighted forever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous gondolier; this system of destruction shall go no farther; I will accept the hearse, under protest, and you may fly your flag of truce in peace, but here I register a dark and bloody oath that you shan't sing. Another yelp, and overboard you go.""

        I began to feel that the old Venice of song and story had departed forever. But I was too hasty. In a few minutes we swept gracefully out into the Grand Canal, and under the mellow moonlight the Venice of poetry and romance stood revealed. Right from the water's edge rose long lines of stately palaces of marble; gondolas were gliding swiftly hither and thither and disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and alleys; ponderous stone bridges threw their shadows athwart the glittering waves. There was life and motion everywhere, and yet everywhere there was a hush, a stealthy sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secret enterprises of bravoes and of lovers; and clad half in moonbeams and half in mysterious shadows, the grim old mansions of the Republic seemed to have an expression about them of having an eye out for just such enterprises as these at that same moment. Music came floating over the waters--Venice was complete.

        It was a beautiful picture--very soft and dreamy and beautiful. But what was this Venice to compare with the Venice of midnight? Nothing. There was a fete--a grand fete in honor of some saint who had been instrumental in checking the cholera three hundred years ago, and all Venice was abroad on the water. It was no common affair, for the Venetians did not know how soon they might need the saint's services again, now that the cholera was spreading every where. So in one vast space--say a third of a mile wide and two miles long--were collected two thousand gondolas, and every one of them had from two to ten, twenty and even thirty colored lanterns suspended about it, and from four to a dozen occupants. Just as far as the eye could reach, these painted lights were massed together--like a vast garden of many-colored flowers, except that these blossoms were never still; they were ceaselessly gliding in and out, and mingling together, and seducing you into bewildering attempts to follow their mazy evolutions. Here and there a strong red, green, or blue glare from a rocket that was struggling to get away, splendidly illuminated all the boats around it. Every gondola that swam by us, with its crescents and pyramids and circles of colored lamps hung aloft, and lighting up the faces of the young and the sweet-scented and lovely below, was a picture; and the reflections of those lights, so long, so slender, so numberless, so many-colored and so distorted and wrinkled by the waves, was a picture likewise, and one that was enchantingly beautiful. Many and many a party of young ladies and gentlemen had their state gondolas handsomely decorated, and ate supper on board, bringing their swallow-tailed, white-cravatted varlets to wait upon them, and having their tables tricked out as if for a bridal supper. They had brought along the costly globe lamps from their drawing-rooms, and the lace and silken curtains from the same places, I suppose. And they had also brought pianos and guitars, and they played and sang operas, while the plebeian paper-lanterned gondolas from the suburbs and the back alleys crowded around to stare and listen.

        There was music every where--choruses, string bands, brass bands, flutes, every thing. I was so surrounded, walled in, with music, magnificence and loveliness, that I became inspired with the spirit of the scene, and sang one tune myself. However, when I observed that the other gondolas had sailed away, and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard, I stopped.

        The fete was magnificent. They kept it up the whole night long, and I never enjoyed myself better than I did while it lasted.

        What a funny old city this Queen of the Adriatic is! Narrow streets, vast, gloomy marble palaces, black with the corroding damps of centuries, and all partly submerged; no dry land visible any where, and no sidewalks worth mentioning; if you want to go to church, to the theatre, or to the restaurant, you must call a gondola. It must be a paradise for cripples, for verily a man has no use for legs here.

        For a day or two the place looked so like an overflowed Arkansas town, because of its currentless waters laving the very doorsteps of all the houses, and the cluster of boats made fast under the windows, or skimming in and out of the alleys and by-ways, that I could not get rid of the impression that there was nothing the matter here but a spring freshet, and that the river would fall in a few weeks and leave a dirty high-water mark on the houses, and the streets full of mud and rubbish.

        In the glare of day, there is little poetry about Venice, but under the charitable moon her stained palaces are white again, their battered sculptures are hidden in shadows, and the old city seems crowned once more with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago. It is easy, then, in fancy, to people these silent canals with plumed gallants and fair ladies--with Shylocks in gaberdine and sandals, venturing loans upon the rich argosies of Venetian commerce--with Othellos and Desdemonas, with Iagos and Roderigos--with noble fleets and victorious legions returning from the wars. In the treacherous sunlight we see Venice decayed, forlorn, poverty-stricken, and commerceless--forgotten and utterly insignificant. But in the moonlight, her fourteen centuries of greatness fling their glories about her, and once more is she the princeliest among the nations of the earth.

        
""There is a glorious city in the sea;
The sea is in the broad, the narrow streets,
Ebbing and flowing; and the salt-sea weed
Clings to the marble of her palaces.
No track of men, no footsteps to and fro,
Lead to her gates! The path lies o'er the sea,
Invisible: and from the land we went,
As to a floating city--steering in,
And gliding up her streets, as in a dream,
So smoothly, silently--by many a dome,
Mosque-like, and many a stately portico,
The statues ranged along an azure sky;
By many a pile, in more than Eastern pride,
Of old the residence of merchant kings;
The fronts of some, tho' time had shatter'd them,
Still glowing with the richest hues of art,
As tho' the wealth within them had run o'er.""

        What would one naturally wish to see first in Venice? The Bridge of Sighs, of course--and next the Church and the Great Square of St. Mark, the Bronze Horses, and the famous Lion of St. Mark.

        We intended to go to the Bridge of Sighs, but happened into the Ducal Palace first--a building which necessarily figures largely in Venetian poetry and tradition. In the Senate Chamber of the ancient Republic we wearied our eyes with staring at acres of historical paintings by Tintoretto and Paul Veronese, but nothing struck us forcibly except the one thing that strikes all strangers forcibly--a black square in the midst of a gallery of portraits. In one long row, around the great hall, were painted the portraits of the Doges of Venice (venerable fellows, with flowing white beards, for of the three hundred Senators eligible to the office, the oldest was usually chosen Doge,) and each had its complimentary inscription attached--till you came to the place that should have had Marino Faliero's picture in it, and that was blank and black--blank, except that it bore a terse inscription, saying that the conspirator had died for his crime. It seemed cruel to keep that pitiless inscription still staring from the walls after the unhappy wretch had been in his grave five hundred years.

        At the head of the Giant's Staircase, where Marino Faliero was beheaded, and where the Doges were crowned in ancient times, two small slits in the stone wall were pointed out--two harmless, insignificant orifices that would never attract a stranger's attention--yet these were the terrible Lions' Mouths! The heads were gone (knocked off by the French during their occupation of Venice,) but these were the throats, down which went the anonymous accusation, thrust in secretly at dead of night by an enemy, that doomed many an innocent man to walk the Bridge of Sighs and descend into the dungeon which none entered and hoped to see the sun again. This was in the old days when the Patricians alone governed Venice--the common herd had no vote and no voice. There were one thousand five hundred Patricians; from these, three hundred Senators were chosen; from the Senators a Doge and a Council of Ten were selected, and by secret ballot the Ten chose from their own number a Council of Three. All these were Government spies, then, and every spy was under surveillance himself--men spoke in whispers in Venice, and no man trusted his neighbor--not always his own brother. No man knew who the Council of Three were--not even the Senate, not even the Doge; the members of that dread tribunal met at night in a chamber to themselves, masked, and robed from head to foot in scarlet cloaks, and did not even know each other, unless by voice. It was their duty to judge heinous political crimes, and from their sentence there was no appeal. A nod to the executioner was sufficient. The doomed man was marched down a hall and out at a door-way into the covered Bridge of Sighs, through it and into the dungeon and unto his death. At no time in his transit was he visible to any save his conductor. If a man had an enemy in those old days, the cleverest thing he could do was to slip a note for the Council of Three into the Lion's mouth, saying ""This man is plotting against the Government."" If the awful Three found no proof, ten to one they would drown him anyhow, because he was a deep rascal, since his plots were unsolvable. Masked judges and masked executioners, with unlimited power, and no appeal from their judgements, in that hard, cruel age, were not likely to be lenient with men they suspected yet could not convict.

        We walked through the hall of the Council of Ten, and presently entered the infernal den of the Council of Three.

        The table around which they had sat was there still, and likewise the stations where the masked inquisitors and executioners formerly stood, frozen, upright and silent, till they received a bloody order, and then, without a word, moved off like the inexorable machines they were, to carry it out. The frescoes on the walls were startlingly suited to the place. In all the other saloons, the halls, the great state chambers of the palace, the walls and ceilings were bright with gilding, rich with elaborate carving, and resplendent with gallant pictures of Venetian victories in war, and Venetian display in foreign courts, and hallowed with portraits of the Virgin, the Saviour of men, and the holy saints that preached the Gospel of Peace upon earth--but here, in dismal contrast, were none but pictures of death and dreadful suffering!--not a living figure but was writhing in torture, not a dead one but was smeared with blood, gashed with wounds, and distorted with the agonies that had taken away its life!

        From the palace to the gloomy prison is but a step--one might almost jump across the narrow canal that intervenes. The ponderous stone Bridge of Sighs crosses it at the second story--a bridge that is a covered tunnel--you can not be seen when you walk in it. It is partitioned lengthwise, and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in ancient times, and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the Three had doomed to lingering misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons, or to sudden and mysterious death. Down below the level of the water, by the light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cells where many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawn miseries of solitary imprisonment--without light, air, books; naked, unshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his useless tongue forgetting its office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life no longer marked, but merged into one eternal eventless night; far away from all cheerful sounds, buried in the silence of a tomb; forgotten by his helpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them forever; losing his own memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there; devouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into the cell by unseen hands, and troubling his worn spirit no more with hopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free; ceasing to scratch vain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself, could see them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, driveling childishness, lunacy! Many and many a sorrowful story like this these stony walls could tell if they could but speak.

        In a little narrow corridor, near by, they showed us where many a prisoner, after lying in the dungeons until he was forgotten by all save his persecutors, was brought by masked executioners and garroted, or sewed up in a sack, passed through a little window to a boat, at dead of night, and taken to some remote spot and drowned.

        They used to show to visitors the implements of torture wherewith the Three were won't to worm secrets out of the accused--villainous machines for crushing thumbs; the stocks where a prisoner sat immovable while water fell drop by drop upon his head till the torture was more than humanity could bear; and a devilish contrivance of steel, which inclosed a prisoner's head like a shell, and crushed it slowly by means of a screw. It bore the stains of blood that had trickled through its joints long ago, and on one side it had a projection whereon the torturer rested his elbow comfortably and bent down his ear to catch the moanings of the sufferer perishing within.

        Of course we went to see the venerable relic of the ancient glory of Venice, with its pavements worn and broken by the passing feet of a thousand years of plebeians and patricians--The Cathedral of St. Mark. It is built entirely of precious marbles, brought from the Orient--nothing in its composition is domestic. Its hoary traditions make it an object of absorbing interest to even the most careless stranger, and thus far it had interest for me; but no further. I could not go into ecstasies over its coarse mosaics, its unlovely Byzantine architecture, or its five hundred curious interior columns from as many distant quarries. Every thing was worn out--every block of stone was smooth and almost shapeless with the polishing hands and shoulders of loungers who devoutly idled here in by-gone centuries and have died and gone to the dev--no, simply died, I mean.

        Under the altar repose the ashes of St. Mark--and Matthew, Luke and John, too, for all I know. Venice reveres those relics above all things earthly. For fourteen hundred years St. Mark has been her patron saint. Every thing about the city seems to be named after him or so named as to refer to him in some way--so named, or some purchase rigged in some way to scrape a sort of hurrahing acquaintance with him. That seems to be the idea. To be on good terms with St. Mark, seems to be the very summit of Venetian ambition. They say St. Mark had a tame lion, and used to travel with him--and every where that St. Mark went, the lion was sure to go. It was his protector, his friend, his librarian. And so the Winged Lion of St. Mark, with the open Bible under his paw, is a favorite emblem in the grand old city. It casts its shadow from the most ancient pillar in Venice, in the Grand Square of St. Mark, upon the throngs of free citizens below, and has so done for many a long century. The winged lion is found every where--and doubtless here, where the winged lion is, no harm can come.

        St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt. He was martyred, I think. However, that has nothing to do with my legend. About the founding of the city of Venice--say four hundred and fifty years after Christ--(for Venice is much younger than any other Italian city,) a priest dreamed that an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought to Venice, the city could never rise to high distinction among the nations; that the body must be captured, brought to the city, and a magnificent church built over it; and that if ever the Venetians allowed the Saint to be removed from his new resting-place, in that day Venice would perish from off the face of the earth. The priest proclaimed his dream, and forthwith Venice set about procuring the corpse of St. Mark. One expedition after another tried and failed, but the project was never abandoned during four hundred years. At last it was secured by stratagem, in the year eight hundred and something. The commander of a Venetian expedition disguised himself, stole the bones, separated them, and packed them in vessels filled with lard. The religion of Mahomet causes its devotees to abhor anything that is in the nature of pork, and so when the Christian was stopped by the officers at the gates of the city, they only glanced once into his precious baskets, then turned up their noses at the unholy lard, and let him go. The bones were buried in the vaults of the grand cathedral, which had been waiting long years to receive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice were secured. And to this day there be those in Venice who believe that if those holy ashes were stolen away, the ancient city would vanish like a dream, and its foundations be buried forever in the unremembering sea.",Mark Twain,1967,[93],1
92,Mockingbird,"[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)",Eminem,1967,"[94, 94]",2

96,"Up Tight, Good Man","There's a track winding back to an old fashioned shack
Along the road to Gundagai
Where the blue gums are growing, the Murrumbidgee's flowing
Beneath that sunny sky
Where my Mummy and Daddy are waiting for me
Where the pals of my childhood are waiting for me
So no more will I roam till I'm headed right for home

On the road to Gundagai

There's an old fashioned Ford made of rubber, tin and board
Along the road to Gundagai
The radiator's hissing, and half the engine's missing
The oil tank's running dry
There's water in the petrol and sand in the gears
And it hasn't seen a garage for more than twenty years
But O lord hear the roar when the pedal hits the floor

Эти суки будут рядом если хапнешь успех
И если что они в моменте растают как снег
Выдыхаешь белый дым, отправляешь его в путь
Трахаться безумно - для тебя это культ
Сегодня мои руки сожмут твою грудь
И мой тихий голос закопает твою грусть

111,An Open Letter To My Teenage Son,"BALTIMORE — “Between the World and Me,” Ta-Nehisi Coates’s meditation on being a black man in America, has had an almost frictionless glide straight to the heart of the national conversation. A blurb from Toni Morrison declared the book, whose publication was moved up from September after the shootings of nine black churchgoers last month in Charleston, S.C., “essential reading,” and its author the heir to James Baldwin. Mostly glowing reviews followed, and this week Mr. Coates clocked appearances on NPR’s “Fresh Air,” PBS’s “Charlie Rose” and the cover of New York Magazine, not to mention the No. 3 spot on Amazon’s best-seller list, right behind Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “Go Set a Watchman.”
Mr. Coates has lived in New York City for the past 14 years with his wife and teenage son, but he was born here. At the book’s official release event on Wednesday, which drew several hundred people to the historic Union Baptist Church in the Upton neighborhood, the atmosphere combined the joy of a homecoming party with a serious statement of purpose. “It was very, very important, as far as I was concerned, that the book be launched in an African-American space,” Mr. Coates, 39, said in an interview the morning after the event. “I wanted to be very clear about who the book was written for, how it was written, what it came out of.”
The audience on Wednesday — which included the former Baltimore mayor Sheila Dixon — greeted Mr. Coates’s words as all-too-familiar home truths. A murmur of recognition passed through the crowd when Mr. Coates read a passage from the book about Prince Jones, a friend from his days at Howard University, who was shot to death by an undercover police officer in Virginia in 2000, a killing he linked to the more recent deaths of Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and other unarmed black men during encounters with the police. Only the cameras, he said, were new.
And there was a thunderous ovation when he spoke of the bodily fear that lies at the heart of the daily lived experience of racism, and “the mind-trick” people play by saying that the racism isn’t real. “He’s a truth teller,” said Karen Pearson, a middle-aged African-American woman waiting in a long line to have Mr. Coates sign her book, not far behind Ms. Dixon.
“I hope it provokes a really honest conversation,” she said, noting the sizable number of white people in the crowd. “I think people might finally be ready for it.” The runaway success of the book has propelled Mr. Coates, a national correspondent at The Atlantic, to a new level of prominence. But he expressed reluctance to be drafted as white America’s designated racial explainer or the activist whom some at the church on Wednesday seemed to want. “I’m a writer, and for me, writing is a very internal process that’s all about trying to learn something and then show it to people,” he said in the interview.
In a brief talk to a group of students from a local school before the reading, he had put it more bluntly. Understanding how an unjust situation came about “is deeply therapeutic,” he told them. “It will keep you from going crazy,” he continued. Mr. Coates’s own trajectory, as he tells it in his 2008 memoir, “The Beautiful Struggle,” is one of relentless self-education. Growing up in Northwest Baltimore in a sprawling family of seven siblings, the son of a schoolteacher mother and a librarian father, he was a voracious reader but indifferent student.
“He was a disgrace to the entire family,” his father, Paul Coates, a onetime Black Panther who now runs an independent publishing company dedicated to out-of-print African-American books, recalled on Wednesday with a laugh. He studied history at Howard but dropped out to pursue journalism, taking a job at Washington City Paper. He moved to New York in 2001, eking out a living as a freelancer between jobs at publications including The Village Voice and Time. He started writing for The Atlantic in 2008 and soon after became one of the magazine’s bloggers, attracting a notably argumentative community of commenters he affectionately calls “the horde.”
He won a National Magazine Award for his 2012 article “Fear of a Black President.” But “The Case for Reparations,” a 15,000-word opus that became one of the most widely viewed articles in the magazine’s history, really put him on the map. His argument was rooted not just in slavery and in Jim Crow, but also in more recent housing discrimination, including the federal government’s redlining of black neighborhoods in the New Deal — a fact, he said, that had been lost to “historical amnesia.” “I got a lot of critiques for that article,” he said. “But what I did not get was, ‘This history is erroneous.’ ”
“Between the World and Me,” written as an open letter to his son, Samori, grew partly out of the feeling that the reparations article, for all its length and detail, “had left something unsaid.” “It was very empirical rather than emotional,” he said. “It was almost like a math problem. But I thought there was also a work of literature in it.” While working on a draft, he picked up Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time,” which he hadn’t read since he was a teenager. He called his editor, Chris Jackson at Spiegel & Grau, and asked why no one wrote that way anymore. Many had tried and failed, Mr. Jackson told him. But maybe he could do it? That conversation, Mr. Coates noted, came not long after he attended an off-the-record meeting between President Obama and liberal opinion journalists.
“Probably being in the White House helped improve my sense that maybe I could do it,” he said, and paused. “God, I hate saying that, but you have to be honest.” In the book, Mr. Coates describes racism in terms of assaults on the free movement of the black body, whether by the officers who shoot unarmed men or in more everyday incidents, like the casual shoving of Samori when he was 4 by a white woman on an Upper West Side escalator. “I wanted to make racism tactile, visceral,” he said. “Because it is.” Against that daily lived reality, he sketches the illusions of “those Americans who believe that they are white” and “the Dreamers,” metaphorical shorthand for people who remain ignorant of the historical realities behind their privilege.
He summed up their outlook: “It is the right for me to walk through my life as though everything I have was justly garnered, to think that I am the descendant of noble ancestries, that I am always a force for good in the world, and that even at the times when I was a force for bad, I was really trying to do the right thing.” “Between the World and Me” gives no quarter to those who seek uplift, or who hold an interpretation of American history that doesn’t take domination of black bodies as a central truth. But the book, Mr. Coates said, is “an act of anti-sentimentalism,” not cynicism. “I don’t write from a default negative position,” he said. “You just have to call things as you see them.”
Next month Mr. Coates is moving to Paris with his family for a year to report for The Atlantic. He’s also working with David Simon, Taylor Branch and James McBride on an HBO series based on Mr. Branch’s civil rights trilogy, “America in the King Years.” Mr. Coates said his own ideal of integration was close to that of Baldwin, who wrote that if the word meant anything, it was “that we, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are,” outside any sheltering fantasy of whiteness. “It’s not, as King said, little black girls beside little white girls,” Mr. Coates said. “It’s looking at little black girls and little white girls and not seeing any difference.",Jennifer Schuessler,1967,"[22, 10, 10, 18, 58, 84]",6

113,Everlasting Love,"[Verse 1]
You became mine in the strangest time
On my life
'Cause baby I, I wasn't right
I was losing the fight and my mind

I will not stand in the way of what we could become
I know that there's still a way to everlasting love

No matter what demons I face

I know that there's still a way to everlasting love

I hope it don't take us to long now

She said ""Boy, what's your name?"", but to answer I was much too shy
Then she took me by the hand and down by the swamp we go
Among the South Georgia pines she would throw me a line of love
And a trick to make it grow, make it grow

She wore her very tight cut-offs like she did when she was in her teens
She let her hair hang down like the ladies down in New Orleans
And then she didn't say much but her actions spoke louder than her words
Among the South Georgia pines she would drop me a line of love
And a trick to make it grow, oh yes, she know

She was my lover and my friend and a pal and a confidant
Yes, she asked me what my game was, I replied ""Anything you want""
She was too hot to handle and she really made my love explode
She was the very first woman who would lead me down the barefoot road, oh, oh

She wore her very tight cut-offs like she did when she was in her teens
And let her hair hang down like the ladies down in New Orleans
And she didn't say much but her actions spoke louder than her words, huh

122,A Letter To Dad,"You know....... in fact you dont know!!!!
You dont know how it feels to love someone for years but all you get as a thank you is broken promises and tears
You dont know how it feels to need that person now to have a future, mask off
You dont know how it feels to love someone so much their fears become yours
I know how it feels let me tell you it hurts and when you let go she says you hurt yourself
I’m watching my life on a screen, I wanna quit paying dstv
I gotta say it’s my fault I said I’d wait forever more like less than a year
I set things in motion, Aiden setting the gears, this ain’t no song just emotions
Maybe you do know you just won’t admit it anyway when you get broken you’ll feel it, how’s Neil
I still get dreams see you invading my head, guess you inside me, while on the outside all anyone sees is me shaking in bed, screaming your name screaming I love you I hate you come back go to hell!!!
No ones listening
Your gone
Everyone thinks I’m insane I do to only for loving you
I hope you miss me I miss you, well the old you screw version 2
You were my fantasy, Disney infinity except 1 was better than 2 death is better than loving you
But what’s the difference?
A war’s going on as a write on this paper letters fight words fighting sentences fighting off the truth but truth is I love you
Well used to.........
I thought I wanted you in my present but that’s a bad gift
You can’t be in my future either I don’t like nasty surprises
You were my first love I can never forget, you were everything now you’ve left me with nothing
But look what it cost where are your real friends who you didn’t push away nothing bro  nothing
We’re together on that one just wandering waiting for the world to end all around us, I’d wanna be lonely with you but it’s not worth the long term damage
I’d rather stay away from you cause it’s either I catch feels or we arguments blow up
I wish we could grow up!!
Forget this make up be us again but how long is it gonna last one day or two or see you in Form 5 see you in Suu btw see you to Suu
Your gonna love me when I’m gone bet you love ghostwriters but then again I ain’t Zimbabwean 😂
Write back when you get this or you could rip it up instead
I’ll see you in my head or when I’m dead
I didn’t mean to hurt you I was just broken glass now I cut you too and I can’t fix myself with shallow apologies that’s fixing glass with paper glue
Just remember I used to love you
But you never loved me too",Big Daddy,1967,"[93, 93, 97, 98]",4

So they wouldn't hit each other when they was shooting

There was one bad guy down there he thought he was
That was Billy De Lyon

So he had a big 45 laying down by the side of him
When they got placed, why, Stagolee spoke to him
He says, ""Boys, look at the money lying down here on the floor""
Says, ""What would we do if old Stagolee and them was to walk in here?""

This guy picked up his 45 he says
""I wouldn't make a bit of difference""
Says, ""Stag's gun won't shoot a bit harder than this one""

And his partner, taking care of the rest

He kind of remembered that was Stagolee
And he commenced begging like this

What I care about your two little babies, darlin' lovin' wife?

133,"Wanted: Lover, No Experience Necessary","An Unusual Honor

To Rena's high-strung and sensitive nature, already under very great tension from her past experience, the ordeal of the next few days was a severe one. On the one hand, Jeff Wain's infatuation had rapidly increased, in view of her speedy departure. From Mrs. Tryon's remark about Wain's wife Amanda, and from things Rena had since learned, she had every reason to believe that this wife was living, and that Wain must be aware of the fact. In the light of this knowledge, Wain's former conduct took on a blacker significance than, upon reflection, she had charitably clothed it with after the first flush of indignation. That he had not given up his design to make love to her was quite apparent, and, with Amanda alive, his attentions, always offensive since she had gathered their import, became in her eyes the expression of a villainous purpose, of which she could not speak to others, and from which she felt safe only so long as she took proper precautions against it. In a week her school would be over, and then she would get Elder Johnson, or some one else than Wain, to take her back to Patesville. True, she might abandon her school and go at once; but her work would be incomplete, she would have violated her contract, she would lose her salary for the month, explanations would be necessary, and would not be forthcoming. She might feign sickness,—indeed, it would scarcely be feigning, for she felt far from well; she had never, since her illness, quite recovered her former vigor—but the inconvenience to others would be the same, and her self-sacrifice would have had, at its very first trial, a lame and impotent conclusion. She had as yet no fear of personal violence from Wain; but, under the circumstances, his attentions were an insult. He was evidently bent upon conquest, and vain enough to think he might achieve it by virtue of his personal attractions. If he could have understood how she loathed the sight of his narrow eyes, with their puffy lids, his thick, tobacco-stained lips, his doubtful teeth, and his unwieldy person, Wain, a monument of conceit that he was, might have shrunk, even in his own estimation, to something like his real proportions. Rena believed that, to defend herself from persecution at his hands, it was only necessary that she never let him find her alone. This, however, required constant watchfulness. Relying upon his own powers, and upon a woman's weakness and aversion to scandal, from which not even the purest may always escape unscathed, and convinced by her former silence that he had nothing serious to fear, Wain made it a point to be present at every public place where she might be. He assumed, in conversation with her which she could not avoid, and stated to others, that she had left his house because of a previous promise to divide the time of her stay between Elder Johnson's house and his own. He volunteered to teach a class in the Sunday-school which Rena conducted at the colored Methodist church, and when she remained to service, occupied a seat conspicuously near her own. In addition to these public demonstrations, which it was impossible to escape, or, it seemed, with so thick-skinned an individual as Wain, even to discourage, she was secretly and uncomfortably conscious that she could scarcely stir abroad without the risk of encountering one of two men, each of whom was on the lookout for an opportunity to find her alone.

The knowledge of Tryon's presence in the vicinity had been almost as much as Rena could bear. To it must be added the consciousness that he, too, was pursuing her, to what end she could not tell. After his letter to her brother, and the feeling therein displayed, she found it necessary to crush once or twice a wild hope that, her secret being still unknown save to a friendly few, he might return and claim her. Now, such an outcome would be impossible. He had become engaged to another woman,—this in itself would be enough to keep him from her, if it were not an index of a vastly more serious barrier, a proof that he had never loved her. If he had loved her truly, he would never have forgotten her in three short months,—three long months they had heretofore seemed to her, for in them she had lived a lifetime of experience. Another impassable barrier lay in the fact that his mother had met her, and that she was known in the neighborhood. Thus cut off from any hope that she might be anything to him, she had no wish to meet her former lover; no possible good could come of such a meeting; and yet her fluttering heart told her that if he should come, as his letter foreshadowed that he might,—if he should come, the loving George of old, with soft words and tender smiles and specious talk of friendship—ah! then, her heart would break! She must not meet him—at any cost she must avoid him.

But this heaping up of cares strained her endurance to the breaking-point. Toward the middle of the last week, she knew that she had almost reached the limit, and was haunted by a fear that she might break down before the week was over. Now her really fine nature rose to the emergency, though she mustered her forces with a great effort. If she could keep Wain at his distance and avoid Tryon for three days longer, her school labors would be ended and she might retire in peace and honor.

""Miss Rena,"" said Plato to her on Tuesday, ""ain't it 'bout time I wuz gwine home wid you ag'in?""

""You may go with me to-morrow, Plato,"" answered the teacher.

After school Plato met an anxious eyed young man in the woods a short distance from the schoolhouse.

""Well, Plato, what news?""

""I's gwine ter see her home ter-morrer, Mars Geo'ge.""

""To-morrow!"" replied Tryon; ""how very fortunate! I wanted you to go to town to-morrow to take an important message for me. I'm sorry, Plato—you might have earned another dollar.""

To lie is a disgraceful thing, and yet there are times when, to a lover's mind, love dwarfs all ordinary laws. Plato scratched his head disconsolately, but suddenly a bright thought struck him.

""Can't I go ter town fer you atter I've seed her home, Mars Geo'ge?""

""N-o, I'm afraid it would be too late,"" returned Tryon doubtfully.

""Den I'll haf ter ax 'er ter lemme go nex' day,"" said Plato, with resignation. The honor might be postponed or, if necessary, foregone; the opportunity to earn a dollar was the chance of a lifetime and must not be allowed to slip.

""No, Plato,"" rejoined Tryon, shaking his head, ""I shouldn't want to deprive you of so great a pleasure."" Tryon was entirely sincere in this characterization of Plato's chance; he would have given many a dollar to be sure of Plato's place and Plato's welcome. Rena's letter had re-inflamed his smouldering passion; only opposition was needed to fan it to a white heat. Wherein lay the great superiority of his position, if he was denied the right to speak to the one person in the world whom he most cared to address? He felt some dim realization of the tyranny of caste, when he found it not merely pressing upon an inferior people who had no right to expect anything better, but barring his own way to something that he desired. He meant her no harm—but he must see her. He could never marry her now—but he must see her. He was conscious of a certain relief at the thought that he had not asked Blanche Leary to be his wife. His hand was unpledged. He could not marry the other girl, of course, but they must meet again. The rest he would leave to Fate, which seemed reluctant to disentangle threads which it had woven so closely.

""I think, Plato, that I see an easier way out of the difficulty. Your teacher, I imagine, merely wants some one to see her safely home. Don't you think, if you should go part of the way, that I might take your place for the rest, while you did my errand?""

""Why, sho'ly, Mars Geo'ge, you could take keer er her better 'n I could—better 'n anybody could—co'se you could!""

Mars Geo'ge was white and rich, and could do anything. Plato was proud of the fact that he had once belonged to Mars Geo'ge. He could not conceive of any one so powerful as Mars Geo'ge, unless it might be God, of whom Plato had heard more or less, and even here the comparison might not be quite fair to Mars Geo'ge, for Mars Geo'ge was the younger of the two. It would undoubtedly be a great honor for the teacher to be escorted home by Mars Geo'ge. The teacher was a great woman, no doubt, and looked white; but Mars Geo'ge was the real article. Mars Geo'ge had never been known to go with a black woman before, and the teacher would doubtless thank Plato for arranging that so great an honor should fall upon her. Mars Geo'ge had given him fifty cents twice, and would now give him a dollar. Noble Mars Geo'ge! Fortunate teacher! Happy Plato!

""Very well, Plato. I think we can arrange it so that you can kill the two rabbits at one shot. Suppose that we go over the road that she will take to go home.""

They soon arrived at the schoolhouse. School had been out an hour, and the clearing was deserted. Plato led the way by the road through the woods to a point where, amid somewhat thick underbrush, another path intersected the road they were following.

""Now, Plato,"" said Tryon, pausing here, ""this would be a good spot for you to leave the teacher and for me to take your place. This path leads to the main road, and will take you to town very quickly. I shouldn't say anything to the teacher about it at all; but when you and she get here, drop behind and run along this path until you meet me,—I'll be waiting a few yards down the road,—and then run to town as fast as your legs will carry you. As soon as you are gone, I'll come out and tell the teacher that I've sent you away on an errand, and will myself take your place. You shall have a dollar, and I'll ask her to let you go home with her the next day. But you mustn't say a word about it, Plato, or you won't get the dollar, and I'll not ask the teacher to let you go home with her again.""

""All right, Mars Geo'ge, I ain't gwine ter say no mo' d'n ef de cat had my tongue.""",Charles Chesnutt,1967,"[84, 84]",2

[Verso 1]
Conforme pasa el tiempo la juventud se termina
Y no lo notas hasta que pierdes la mitad 'e tu vida
Sin haber sentido las cosas simples y especiales
Como a tu gente, que abrazaste solo en navidades

Pues te invaden el orgullo y el egoísmo
Trabajando a diario pa' emborracharte los domingos
O en el peor de los casos, viendo tele en esa silla
Hasta que te das cuenta que tu hija menor ya se maquilla, sí (yo)

La vida es un parpadeo
Donde la meta es ser feliz, al menos así yo lo veo
Nos preocupamos por estupideces y olvidamos
Que al morir sólo llevamos lo que disfrutamos

Pareciera que fue hace media hora
El tiempo es la locomotora

Por eso debemos aprovechar las horas

Recuerdo lo que dijo el amor de mi vida
El día en que su madre justamente perdió la suya
Dijo que nos preocupamos por tonterías
Tonterías que hacen que la felicidad se destruya

Es que se ha confundido la felicidad con dinero en exceso
Mientras la vida se escapa sin retroceso
Hoy no se pueden dar besos en lugares públicos
Donde sí se puede hacer campaña a los políticos

Si lo estudiamos notamos que el amor es segundo plano
Excepto el amor por lo que tengamos, claro
Como el carro, la casa y toda esa paja
Que no nos podremos llevar cuando durmamos en la caja

Live it fully live it fast

Cup of joy and drink it

Fly with me to see the setting summer sun
And stay with me to see it rise
And say to the those who say
To live this way is mad
That mad we'd rather be than wise
Live just live for life

Yesterday's a memory gone for good
For ever, while tomorrow is a guess
What is real is what is here and now
The here and now is all that we possess
So take my hand and we will take
The moment, if for just the
Moment's happiness
Live just for life

If you let it, it will lead you
Through the mystery and wonder
Of a world you've never known before
Share the splendors to be shared
Magic places to explore
Dare the dangers to be dared
Cause life is all of this and more
This and more, ooooooooh

Come with me to where
The hills are green and still
And filled with flowers to adore
Come with me to where the laughter sings
And drowns the pounding sounds of guns of war
Come with me my love and

Out of the blue, it all changed in an instant
He was nineteen when she told him she was pregnant
Barely out of high school, living in a small town
Neither of 'em had a job or money in the bank
He got work on the factory floor
Struggling to make ends meet but she adored him
Always in his corner when her parents started on her, like
""He won't ever amount to that much""
The baby arrived, really, they tried
She said, ""Let's do the best we can, a day at a time""
He started staying out all night, getting drunk
Convinced he couldn't deal with what he had and what he'd done
He lost his job and that was no surprise
She said, ""I can't go on watching you destroy your life
You need to get it together or I'm leaving with our kid""
He said, ""It's probably best if you left,"" so she did

Five years later and she's living in the city
She'd severed all contact to her old life
Her little girl's at school, and she was working days
Staying up late and studying through the night

He said he'd got a job up north on fishing trawlers
He hadn't touched a drink, for two years, he'd been clean
Plus he saved some money on the side in between
He cleared his throat, made an awkward joke
And asked, ""Maybe I could come and visit you both?
But only if you think it's alright, I mean""
She said she'd think about it, the next day, she agreed

He got on a plane and flew across the desert
Watching as the world flew by

Each waiting for the other one to speak first

145,Suzanne,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On Our Lady of the Harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",Leonard Cohen,1967,"[56, 56, 57, 60, 70, 86]",6

[HARRY, spoken]
Listen, Draco. Ron and Hermione are my best friends in the whole world, I wouldn't trade them for anything.

[DRACO, spoken]
Have it your way. Wait, don't tell me; red hair, hand me down clothes and a stupid complexion. You must be a Weasley.

[Isabella]
And sometimes kinda gross
It's embarrassingly gassy
And it leaves its dirty underwear
In piles around the place
Love is rude
It has a sort of smell
And it thinks that you don't notice
And it blurts out things that make you wanna smack it's stupid face
And it's awkward and confusing
It annoys you half to death
Then it grins that dopey grin
And you can't catch your breath

Love is strange and sometimes sort of smug
And it's really really bossy
And it messes with your head

And I somehow missed the meaning of love that is real
And it compliments my scars that will never heal

Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage

[Verse 2]
And if you weren't gonna guide me
Why bring me into the light?
Must have done something
To make you want to run and hide
Why oh why didn't you just live your life?
And every girl needs a mother
And damn it I needed you
Instead you duck for cover
And you ran from the truth
And like kids do, you waited around for proof

Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?

One day, Jim's papa told him
Things were looking down
And they packed up everything
They owned and left this little old town
Each tear I dried for you
The closer our lives grew
I fell in love it's true
And you say you love me, too

Well, don't you know I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?

How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?

How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved Jim?

The day you see his face again
Or hear his voice
I don't want to be a loser
If you have to make a choice
Like a puppet to a string
To you, girl, I'm attached
And I know I'd be in trouble
If he came and took you back
I feel so insecure
In my mind, I can picture
Losing you for sure
And the pain I can't endure

How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?

How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved Jim?

I can't stop loving you, baby
I can't stop loving you , no
I can't stop loving you, baby
I feel so insecure
In my mind, I
Can picture
Losing you for sure
And the pain I can't endure
Baby, I'm worried
Really, really worried
I wanna make you happy
Really truly happy

158,Homburg,"Your multilingual business friend
Has packed her bags and fled
Leaving only ash-filled ashtrays
And the lipstick, unmade bed
The mirror, on reflection
Has climbed back upon the wall
For the floor she found descended
And the ceiling was too tall

Your trouser cuffs are dirty
And your shoes are laced up wrong
You'd better take off your Homburg
'Cause your overcoat is too long

Town clock in the market square
Stands waiting for the hour
When its hands they both turn backward
And on meeting will devour
Both themselves and also any fool
Who dares to tell the time
And the sun and moon will shadow
And the signpost cease to sign

Your trouser cuffs are dirty
And your shoes are laced up wrong
You'd better take off your Homburg
'Cause your overcoat is too long

Your trouser cuffs are dirty
And your shoes are laced up wrong
You'd better take off your Homburg

159,This Town,"[Verse 1]
Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 2]
I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Bridge]
And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you",Niall Horan,1967,"[53, 53, 53, 63, 78]",5

But the roads are blocked, and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

That's a lie I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky
Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride

I'm here because
The wrong I've done...
Made me ashamed

What you say?
(Girl, this my body)

[Verse 1]
You ain't know? Texas women do it bigger
(What? Say it ain't so)
In the south, it gets no realer, baby
Pot full of grits, I'm hotter than your mama's supper, boy
Better get with it
Better watch your mouth, I might burn you, boy
You go, uh, downtown, gonna work
Good Lord like dessert
If ya scared, go to church
Woo, woo, on alert
Hold on tight, little country boy
I ain't no girl, I'm a boss with orders
All I'm needin' is a baby to love me
Like a warm biscuit on a Sunday mornin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I got what you want, I'm aimin' to please
I got what it takes, I sure got the means
I got what you want
Sugar, honey, iced tea
All eyes on me, oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I'm a whole lotta woman

One time for the green
And rollin' like Tina

[Bridge]
Ain't no competition, babe
It's just can you keep up with me?
I can't do a thing about my wicked ways with gravity
Higher than the leaves, they fall from trees like D-O-Double G's
I reside in Tennessee, but Texas still flows deep in me

[Chorus]
I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the way I walk and toss my hips)
Hey, I'm a whole lotta woman

178,You Mean The World To Me,"[Verse 1]

Uh
They all call you a dime, I say you're priceless
I might just wife this girl cause she the nicest
Precise with, Her hair and make up she's viceless
Damn and that girl turns me on like a light switch
Man she's everything I plan for, and more
I'll take you out the game so never let another man score
You brighten my day when we're apart it get's dark
And I'mma give you the world but let me start with my heart
Cause

[Hook]

You mean the world to me
I'd give up everything it's only for your love I breath
There ain't no question baby
You mean the world to me
I'd give you anything you ask for
You know you mean the world to me

[Verse 2]

I want you to know you're beautiful
From you hair to your cuticles
Dope as Pharmaceuticals, One is your numeral
Just add uno mo, it could be me and you
Seein’ through the bullshit
A cool chick the things that we could do
I just want to be with you
Make you say my name like Beetlejuice
And we get the car debarked, we don't need a roof
Sometimes you don't see what I see in you
It's cool I’ll just find you remind you, When you need a clue
Pointing out the obvious
Like damn you're such a hottie miss
Yo body is flyer than karate kicks
I’ll Mr. Miyagi this beat it on some Rodney ish
And these girls are probably pissed
Cause you're greater than Ali is
And you're perfection, I’m just great can you work with that?
Same people hate probably still think the earth is flat
And I swear we'd be the perfect match
And I just hope it made you smile when you heard this rap
Because

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Girl you out of sight like Stevie
Believe me, She's thee one the fellas love
And all the girls are jealous of
And damn who's to blame?
I could see you're a piece of art just looking at your frame
Wanna be the nigga with ya, Cause I see the bigger picture
Her looks catch you eyes, But her personality get ya
That's why I dig ya, Cause it's deeper than the surface
Damn and that girl's still stunning at her turfst
I put verses in hearses so you can purchase some purses
I'm not saying you're perfect but I understand that you're worth it
Cause you the type of girl I plan on leaving this earth wit
And when I have my first kid I pray that you birth it
Cause, You on fire like Pryor you're my desire
Attire flyer than Mýa
Have you hitting notes like a choir
I’m just trying to make you perspire cause you the one I admire
And girl you're so dope I’m in love with my supplier

179,Can't Stop Loving You,"[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, ""I do""
""I do""
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, ""Hey, Farewell"" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do",Michael Jackson,1967,"[78, 79, 79, 81, 84]",5
180,Get Down,"[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get, get, get down!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Outro: Salaam Remi]
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change",Nas,1967,"[79, 80, 81, 84, 85, 91]",6

The proteiform graph itself is a polyhedron of scripture. There was a time when naif alphabetters would have written it down the tracing of a purely deliquescent recidivist, possibly ambidextrous, snubnosed probably and presenting a strangely profound rainbowl in his (or her) occiput. To the hardily curio-sing entomophilust then it has shown a very sexmosaic of nym — phosis in which the eternal chimerahunter Oriolopos, now frond of sugars, then lief of saults, the sensory crowd in his belly coupled with an eye for the goods trooth bewilderblissed by their night effluvia with guns like drums and fondlers like forceps persequestellates his vanessas from flore to flore.

All’s so herou from us him in a kitchernott darkness, by hasard and worn rolls arered, we must grope on till Zerogh hour like pou owl giaours as we are would we salve aught of moments for our aysore today. Amousin though not but. Closer inspection of the bordereau would reveal a multiplicity of person-alities inflicted on the documents or document and some prevision of virtual crime or crimes might be made by anyone unwary enough before any suitable occasion for it or them had so far managed to happen along. In fact, under the closed eyes of the inspectors the traits featuring the chiaroscuro coalesce, their con trarieties eliminated, in one stable somebody similarly as by the providential warring of heartshaker with housebreaker and of dramdrinker against freethinker our social something bowls along bumpily, experiencing a jolting series of prearranged disappoint-ments, down the long lane of (it’s as semper as oxhousehumper! generations, more generations and still more generations.

Say, baroun lousadoor, who in hallhagal wrote the durn thing anyhow? Erect, beseated, mountback, against a partywall, below freezigrade, by the use of quill or style, with turbid or pellucid mind, accompanied or the reverse by mastication, interrupted by visit of seer to scribe or of scribe to site, atwixt two showers or atosst of a trike, rained upon or blown around, by a right-down regular racer from the soil or by a too pained whittlewit laden with the loot of learning?

Now, patience; and remember patience is the great thing, and above all things else we must avoid anything like being or be-coming out of patience. A good plan used by worried business folk who may not have had many momentums to master Kung’s doctrine of the meang or the propriety codestruces of Carpri-mustimus is just to think of all the sinking fund of patience pos — sessed in their conjoint names by both brothers Bruce with whom are incorporated their Scotch spider and Elberfeld’s Calculating Horses. If after years upon years of delving in ditches dark one tubthumper more than others, Kinihoun or Kahanan, giardarner or mear measenmanonger, has got up for the darnall same pur-pose of reassuring us with all the barbar of the Carrageehouse that our great ascendant was properly speaking three syllables less than his own surname (yes, yes, less!), that the ear of Fionn Earwicker aforetime was the trademark of a broadcaster with wicker local jargon for an ace’s patent (Hear! Calls! Everywhair!) then as to this radiooscillating epiepistle to which, cotton, silk or samite, kohol, gall or brickdust, we must ceaselessly return, where-abouts exactly at present in Siam, Hell or Tophet under that glorisol which plays touraloup with us in this Aludin’s Cove of our cagacity is that bright soandsuch to slip us the dinkum oil?

Naysayers we know. To conclude purely negatively from the positive absence of political odia and monetary requests that its page cannot ever have been a penproduct of a man or woman of that period or those parts is only one more unlookedfor conclu-sion leaped at, being tantamount to inferring from the nonpre — sence of inverted commas (sometimes called quotation marks) on any page that its author was always constitutionally incapable of misappropriating the spoken words of others.

Luckily there is another can't to the questy. Has any fellow, of the dime a dozen type, it might with some profit some dull evening quietly be hinted — has any usual sort of ornery josser, flat — chested fortyish, faintly flatulent and given to ratiocination by syncopation in the elucidation of complications, of his greatest Fung Yang dynasdescendanced, only another the son of, in fact, ever looked sufficiently longly at a quite everydaylooking stamped addressed envelope? Admittedly it is an outer husk: its face, in all its featureful perfection of imperfection, is its fortune: it ex-hibits only the civil or military clothing of whatever passion — pallid nudity or plaguepurple nakedness may happen to tuck it — self under its flap. Yet to concentrate solely on the literal sense or even the psychological content of any document to the sore neglect of the enveloping facts themselves circumstantiating it is just as hurtful to sound sense (and let it be added to the truest taste) as were some fellow in the act of perhaps getting an intro from another fellow turning out to be a friend in need of his, say, to a lady of the latter’s acquaintance, engaged in performing the elaborative antecistral ceremony of upstheres, straightaway to run off and vision her plump and plain in her natural altogether, pre-ferring to close his blinkhard’s eyes to the ethiquethical fact that she was, after all, wearing for the space of the time being some definite articles of evolutionary clothing, inharmonious creations, a captious critic might describe them as, or not strictly necessary or a trifle irritating here and there, but for all that suddenly full of local colour and personal perfume and suggestive, too, of so very much more and capable of being stretched, filled out, if need or wish were, of having their surprisingly like coincidental parts separated don’t they now, for better survey by the deft hand of an expert, don’t you know? Who in his heart doubts either that the facts of feminine clothiering are there all the time or that the feminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there also at the same time, only a little to the rere? Or that one may be separated from the other? Or that both may then be contemplated simultaneously? Or that each may be taken up and considered in turn apart from the other?

Here let a few artifacts fend in their own favour. The river felt she wanted salt. That was just where Brien came in. The country asked for bearspaw for dindin! And boundin aboundin it got it surly. We who live under heaven, we of the clovery kingdom, we middlesins people have often watched the sky overreaching the land. We suddenly have. Our isle is Sainge. The place. That stern chuckler Mayhappy Mayhapnot, once said to repeation in that lutran conservatory way of his that Isitachapel–Asitalukin was the one place, ult aut nult, in this madh vaal of tares (whose verdhure’s yellowed therever Phaiton parks his car while its tamelised tay is the drame of Drainophilias) where the possible was the improbable and the improbable the inevitable. If the pro-verbial bishop of our holy and undivided with this me ken or no me ken Zot is the Quiztune havvermashed had his twoe nails on the head we are in for a sequentiality of improbable possibles though possibly nobody after having grubbed up a lock of cwold cworn aboove his subject probably in Harrystotalies or the vivle will go out of his way to applaud him on the onboiassed back of his remark for utterly impossible as are all these events they are probably as like those which may have taken place as any others which never took person at all are ever likely to be. Ahahn!

About that original hen. Midwinter (fruur or kuur?) was in the offing and Premver a promise of a pril when, as kischabrigies sang life’s old sahatsong, an iceclad shiverer, merest of bantlings ob-served a cold fowl behaviourising strangely on that fatal midden or chip factory or comicalbottomed copsjute (dump for short) afterwards changed into the orangery when in the course of deeper demolition unexpectedly one bushman’s holiday its limon threw up a few spontaneous fragments of orangepeel, the last remains of an outdoor meal by some unknown sunseeker or place-hider illico way back in his mistridden past. What child of a strand — looper but keepy little Kevin in the despondful surrounding of such sneezing cold would ever have trouved up on a strate that was called strete a motive for future saintity by euchring the finding of the Ardagh chalice by another heily innocent and beachwalker whilst trying with pious clamour to wheedle Tip- peraw raw raw reeraw puteters out of Now Sealand in spignt of the patchpurple of the massacre, a dual a duel to die to day, goddam and biggod, sticks and stanks, of most of the Jacobiters.

The bird in the case was Belinda of the Dorans, a more than quinquegintarian (Terziis prize with Serni medal, Cheepalizzy’s Hane Exposition) and what she was scratching at the hour of klokking twelve looked for all this zogzag world like a goodish-sized sheet of letterpaper originating by transhipt from Boston (Mass.) of the last of the first to Dear whom it proceded to mention Maggy well & allathome’s health well only the hate turned the mild on the van Houtens and the general’s elections with a lovely face of some born gentleman with a beautiful present of wedding cakes for dear thankyou Chriesty and with grand funferall of poor Father Michael don’t forget unto life’s & Muggy well how are you Maggy & hopes soon to hear well & must now close it with fondest to the twoinns with four crosskisses for holy paul holey comer holipoli whollyisland pee ess from (locust may eat all but this sign shall they never) affectionate largelooking tache of tch. The stain, and that a teastain (the overcautelousness of the masterbilker here, as usual, signing the page away), marked it off on the spout of the moment as a genuine relique of ancient Irish pleasant pottery of that lydialike languishing class known as a hurry-me-o’er-the-hazy.

Why then how?

Well, almost any photoist worth his chemicots will tip anyone asking him the teaser that if a negative of a horse happens to melt enough while drying, well, what you do get is, well, a positively grotesquely distorted macromass of all sorts of horsehappy values and masses of meltwhile horse. Tip. Well, this freely is what must have occurred to our missive (there’s a sod of a turb for you! please wisp off the grass!) unfilthed from the boucher by the sagacity of a lookmelittle likemelong hen. Heated residence in the heart of the orangeflavoured mudmound had partly ob-literated the negative to start with, causing some features pal — pably nearer your pecker to be swollen up most grossly while the farther back we manage to wiggle the more we need the loan of a lens to see as much as the hen saw. Tip.

You is feeling like you was lost in the bush, boy? You says: It is a puling sample jungle of woods. You most shouts out: Bethicket me for a stump of a beech if I have the poultriest no-tions what the farest he all means. Gee up, girly! The quad gos — pellers may own the targum but any of the Zingari shoolerim may pick a peck of kindlings yet from the sack of auld hensyne.

Lead, kindly fowl! They always did: ask the ages. What bird has done yesterday man may do next year, be it fly, be it moult, be it hatch, be it agreement in the nest. For her socioscientific sense is sound as a bell, sir, her volucrine automutativeness right on normalcy: she knows, she just feels she was kind of born to lay and love eggs (trust her to propagate the species and hoosh her fluffballs safe through din and danger!); lastly but mostly, in her genesic field it is all game and no gammon; she is ladylike in everything she does and plays the gentleman’s part every time. Let us auspice it! Yes, before all this has time to end the golden age must return with its vengeance. Man will become dirigible, Ague will be rejuvenated, woman with her ridiculous white bur-den will reach by one step sublime incubation, the manewanting human lioness with her dishorned discipular manram will lie down together publicly flank upon fleece. No, assuredly, they are not justified, those gloompourers who grouse that letters have never been quite their old selves again since that weird weekday in bleak Janiveer (yet how palmy date in a waste’s oasis!) when to the shock of both, Biddy Doran looked at literature.

And. She may be a mere marcella, this midget madgetcy, Misthress of Arths. But. It is not a hear or say of some anomo-rous letter, signed Toga Girilis, (teasy dear). We have a cop of her fist right against our nosibos. We note the paper with her jotty young watermark: Notre Dame du Bon March‚. And she has a heart of Arin! What lumililts as she fols with her falli-mineers and her nadianods. As a strow will shaw she does the wind blague, recting to show the rudess of a robur curling and shewing the fansaties of a frizette. But how many of her readers realise that she is not out to dizzledazzle with a graith uncouthre-ment of postmantuam glasseries from the lapins and the grigs. Nuttings on her wilelife!

Yet is it but an old story, the tale of a Treestone with one Ysold, of a Mons held by tentpegs and his pal whatholoosed on the run, what Cadman could but Badman wouldn’t, any Genoaman against any Venis, and why Kate takes charge of the waxworks.

Habes aures et num videbis? Habes oculos ac mannepalpabuat? Tip! Drawing nearer to take our slant at it (since after all it has met with misfortune while all underground), let us see all there may remain to be seen.

I am a worker, a tombstone mason, anxious to pleace avery-buries and jully glad when Christmas comes his once ayear. You are a poorjoist, unctuous to polise nopebobbies and tunnibelly soully when ’tis thime took o’er home, gin. We cannot say aye to aye. We cannot smile noes from noes. Still. One cannot help noticing that rather more than half of the lines run north-south in the Nemzes and Bukarahast directions while the others go west-east in search from Maliziies with Bulgarad for, tiny tot though it looks when schtschupnistling alongside other incuna-bula, it has its cardinal points for all that. These ruled barriers along which the traced words, run, march, halt, walk, stumble at doubtful points, stumble up again in comparative safety seem to have been drawn first of all in a pretty checker with lamp-black and blackthorn. Such crossing is antechristian of course, but the use of the homeborn shillelagh as an aid to calligraphy shows a distinct advance from savagery to barbarism. It is seriously believed by some that the intention may have been geodetic, or, in the view of the cannier, domestic economical. But by writing thithaways end to end and turning, turning and end to end hithaways writing and with lines of litters slittering up and louds of latters slettering down, the old semetomyplace and jupetbackagain from tham Let Rise till Hum Lit. Sleep, where in the waste is the wisdom?
Another point, in addition to the original sand, pounce pow-der, drunkard paper or soft rag used (any vet or inhanger in ous sot’s social can see the seen for seemself, a wee ftofty od room, the cheery spluttered on the one karrig, a darka disheen of voos from Dalbania, any gotsquantity of racky, a portogal and some buk setting out on the sofer, you remember the sort of softball sucker motru used to tell us when we were all biribiyas or nippies and messas) it has acquired accretions of terricious matter whilst loitering in the past. The teatimestained terminal (say not the tag, mummer, or our show’s a failure!) is a cosy little brown study all to oneself and, whether it be thumb-print, mademark or just a poor trait of the artless, its importance in establishing the identities in the writer complexus (for if the hand was one, the minds of active and agitated were more than so) will be best appreciated by never forgetting that both before and after the battle of the Boyne it was a habit not to sign letters always. Tip. And it is surely a lesser ignorance to write a word with every consonant too few than to add all too many. The end? Say it with missiles then and thus arabesque the page. You have your cup of scalding Souchong, your taper’s waxen drop, your cat’s paw, the clove or coffinnail you chewed or champed as you worded it, your lark in clear air. So why, pray, sign any-thing as long as every word, letter, penstroke, paperspace is a perfect signature of its own? A true friend is known much more easily, and better into the bargain, by his personal touch, habits of full or undress, movements, response to appeals for charity than by his footwear, say. And, speaking anent Tiberias and other incestuish salacities among gerontophils, a word of warning about the tenderloined passion hinted at. Some softnosed per-user might mayhem take it up erogenously as the usual case of spoons, prostituta in herba plus dinky pinks deliberatively summer-saulting off her bisexycle, at the main entrance of curate’s per — petual soutane suit with her one to see and awoh! who picks her up as gingerly as any balmbearer would to feel whereupon the virgin was most hurt and nicely asking: whyre have you been so grace a mauling and where were you chaste me child? Be who, farther potential? and so wider but we grisly old Sykos who have done our unsmiling bit on ‘alices, when they were yung and easily freudened, in the penumbra of the procuring room and what oracular comepression we have had apply to them! could (did we care to sell our feebought silence in camera) tell our very moistnostrilled one that father in such virgated contexts is not always that undemonstrative relative (often held up to our contumacy) who settles our hashbill for us and what an innocent all — abroad’s adverb such as Michaelly looks like can be suggestive of under the pudendascope and, finally, what a neurasthene nym-pholept, endocrine-pineal typus, of inverted parentage with a prepossessing drauma present in her past and a priapic urge for congress with agnates before cognates fundamentally is feeling for under her lubricitous meiosis when she refers with liking to some feeler she fancie’s face. And Mm. We could. Yet what need to say? ’Tis as human a little story as paper could well carry, in affect, as singsing so Salaman susuing to swittvitles while as unbluffingly blurtubruskblunt as an Esra? the cat, the cat’s meeter, the meeter’s cat’s wife, the meeter’s cat’s wife’s half better, the meeter’s cat’s wife’s half better’s meeter, and so back to our horses, for we also know, what we have perused from the pages of I Was A Gemral, that Showting up of Bulsklivism by ‘Schot-tenboum’, that Father Michael about this red time of the white terror equals the old regime and Margaret is the social revolution while cakes mean the party funds and dear thank you signifies national gratitude. In fine, we have heard, as it happened, of Spartacus intercellular. We are not corknered yet, dead hand! We can recall, with voluntears, the froggy jew, and sweeter far ’twere now westhinks in Dumbil’s fair city ere one more year is o’er. We tourned our coasts to the good gay tunes. When from down swords the sea merged the oldowth guns and answer made the bold O’ Dwyer. But. Est modest in verbos. Let a prostitute be whoso stands before a door and winks or parks herself in the fornix near a makeussin wall (sinsin! sinsin!) and the curate one who brings strong waters (gingin! gingin!), but also, and dinna forget, that there is many asleeps between someathome’s first and moreinausland’s last and that the beautiful presence of waiting kates will until life’s (!) be more than enough to make any milkmike in the language of sweet tarts punch hell’s hate into his twin nicky and that Maggy’s tea, or your majesty, if heard as a boost from a born gentleman is (?). For if the lingo gasped between kicksheets, however basically English, were to be preached from the mouths of wickerchurchwardens and metaphysicians in the row and advokaatoes, allvoyous, demivoyelles, languoaths, les-biels, dentelles, gutterhowls and furtz, where would their prac — tice be or where the human race itself were the Pythagorean ses — quipedalia of the panepistemion, however apically Volapucky, grunted and gromwelled, ichabod, habakuk, opanoff, uggamyg, hapaxle, gomenon, ppppfff, over country stiles, behind slated dwellinghouses, down blind lanes, or, when all fruit fails, under some sacking left on a coarse cart? So hath been, love: tis tis: and will be: till wears and tears and ages. Thief us the night, steal we the air, shawl thiner liefest, mine! Here, Ohere, insult the fair! Traitor, bad hearer, brave! The lightning look, the birding cry, awe from the grave, ever-flowing on the times. Feueragusaria iordenwater; now godsun shine on menday’s daughter; a good clap, a fore marriage, a bad wake, tell hell’s well; such is manowife’s lot of lose and win again, like he’s gruen quhiskers on who’s chin again, she plucketed them out but they grown in again. So what are you going to do about it? O dear!

Now, kapnimancy and infusionism may both fit as tight as two trivets but while we in our wee free state, holding to that prestatute in our charter, may have our irremovable doubts as to the whole sense of the lot, the interpretation of any phrase in the whole, the meaning of every word of a phrase so far de-ciphered out of it, however unfettered our Irish daily indepen — dence, we must vaunt no idle dubiosity as to its genuine author — ship and holusbolus authoritativeness. And let us bringtheecease to beakerings on that clink, olmond bottler! On the face of it, to volt back to our desultory horses, and for your roughshod mind, bafflelost bull, the affair is a thing once for all done and there you are somewhere and finished in a certain time, be it a day or a year or even supposing, it should eventually turn out to be a serial number of goodness gracious alone knows how many days or years. Anyhow, somehow and somewhere, before the bookflood or after her ebb, somebody mentioned by name in his telephone directory, Coccolanius or Gallotaurus, wrote it, wrote it all, wrote it all down, and there you are, full stop. O, undoubtedly yes, and very potably so, but one who deeper thinks will always bear in the baccbuccus of his mind that this down-right there you are and there it is is only all in his eye. Why?

Because, Soferim Bebel, if it goes to that, (and dormerwindow gossip will cry it from the housetops no surelier than the writing on the wall will hue it to the mod of men that mote in the main street) every person, place and thing in the chaosmos of Alle anyway connected with the gobblydumped turkery was moving and changing every part of the time: the travelling inkhorn (possibly pot), the hare and turtle pen and paper, the continually more and less intermisunderstanding minds of the anticollabora-tors, the as time went on as it will variously inflected, differently pronounced, otherwise spelled, changeably meaning vocable scriptsigns. No, so holp me Petault, it is not a miseffectual why-acinthinous riot of blots and blurs and bars and balls and hoops and wriggles and juxtaposed jottings linked by spurts of speed: it only looks as like it as damn it; and, sure, we ought really to rest thankful that at this deleteful hour of dungflies dawning we have even a written on with dried ink scrap of paper at all to show for ourselves, tare it or leaf it, (and we are lufted to ourselves as the soulfisher when he led the cat out of the bout) after all that we lost and plundered of it even to the hidmost coignings of the earth and all it has gone through and by all means, after a good ground kiss to Terracussa and for wars luck our lefftoff’s flung over our home homoplate, cling to it as with drowning hands, hoping against hope all the while that, by the light of philo-phosy, (and may she never folsage us!) things will begin to clear up a bit one way or another within the next quarrel of an hour and be hanged to them as ten to one they will too, please the pigs, as they ought to categorically, as, stricly between ourselves, there is a limit to all things so this will never do.

For, with that farmfrow’s foul flair for that flayfell foxfetor, (the calamite’s columitas calling for calamitous calamitance) who that scrutinising marvels at those indignant whiplooplashes; those so prudently bolted or blocked rounds;

The unmistaken identity of the persons in the Tiberiast du-plex came to light in the most devious of ways. The original document was in what is known as Hanno O’Nonhanno’s unbrookable script, that is to say, it showed no signs of punctua — tion of any sort. Yet on holding the verso against a lit rush this new book of Morses responded most remarkably to the silent query of our world’s oldest light and its recto let out the piquant fact that it was but pierced butnot punctured (in the university sense of the term) by numerous stabs and foliated gashes made by a pronged instrument. These paper wounds, four in type, were gradually and correctly understood to mean stop, please stop, do please stop, and O do please stop respectively, and following up their one true clue, the circumflexuous wall of a singleminded men’s asylum, accentuated by bi tso fb rok engl a ssan dspl itch ina, — Yard inquiries pointed out þ that they ad bin “provoked” ay þ fork, of … grave BrofŠsor; …th ‚‘s BrŠak — fast — table;; ac — tely profŠssionally piqu‚d, to = introd — ce a notion of time [— pon … plane (?) s — ‘ ‘ f…‡‘e’] by p — nct! ingh oles (sic) in Ispace?!

Going out into the street at night
The answers he may meet hm hm
With sick and twisted minds
He shares the searching questions
His heart bears hm hm
And from the dregs
The answers find their way into his supple mind
In time the planted seeds will grow
Into a twisted vine below
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

And now his aimless days begin
To drift into sordid sin hm, hm
And soon his dislike turns to hate
As the stamp of life seals his fate hm, hm
And so the night conceals his name
And the days sleep off his shame
Deprived of love and wrought by fear

206,Birds Of Britain,"[WASHINGTON]
Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you’re here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???

The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton’s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

[JEFFERSON]
‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn’t settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em
Don’t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
Oww

[JEFFERSON]
But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume state’s debts
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits

[HAMILTON]
Not true!

[JEFFERSON]
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it
If New York’s in debt—
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I’m afraid
Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it’s too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamilton’s candidacy
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gon’ happen when you try to tax our whisky

[WASHINGTON & CROWD]
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson
That's my alcohol!
Secretary Hamilton, your response

[HAMILTON]
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present, we’re running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If we’re aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost. You’d rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
Your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for labor
“We plant seeds in the South. We create.”
Yeah, keep ranting
We know who’s really doing the planting
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Don’t lecture me about the war, you didn’t fight in it
You think I’m frightened of you, man?
We almost died in the trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
Reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison
Madison, you’re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
Damn, you’re in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin’ there useless as two shits
Hey, turn around, bend over, I’ll show you
Where my shoe fits

[WASHINGTON]
Excuse me? Madison, Jefferson, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! We’ll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
A word

[MADISON]
You don’t have the votes

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
You don’t have the votes

[JEFFERSON]
Aha-ha-ha ha!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
You’re gonna need congressional approval and you don’t have the votes

[JEFFERSON]
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder

[MADISON]
Why he even brings the thunder…

[WASHINGTON]
You wanna pull yourself together?

[HAMILTON]
I’m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather

[WASHINGTON]
Young man, I’m from Virginia, so watch your mouth

[HAMILTON]
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?

[WASHINGTON]
You need the votes

[HAMILTON]
No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan

[WASHINGTON]
No, you need to convince more folks

[HAMILTON]
James Madison won’t talk to me, that’s a nonstarter

[WASHINGTON]
Winning was easy, young man. Governing’s harder

[HAMILTON]
They’re being intransigent

[WASHINGTON]
You have to find a compromise

[HAMILTON]
But they don’t have a plan, they just hate mine!

[WASHINGTON]
Convince them otherwise

[HAMILTON]
What happens if I don’t get congressional approval?

[WASHINGTON]
I imagine they’ll call for your removal

[HAMILTON]
Sir—

209,(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher And Higher,"Your love lifted me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, question my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

You know your love (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (Your love keeps lifting me)
Higher, higher and higher (Your love keeps lifting me)
I said your love (Your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (Your love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me higher and higher

Now once I was down hearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and it soon departed
And you know he never showed his face again

That's why your love (Your love keeps lifting me)

210,Dandelion,"Repeat to yourself that they're not really gone
Time has proven that fooling yourself into believing a lie is the most effective way to deal with things you have no control over

Keep listening to the mixtapes they made you
Overanalyse every single word you hear
""Was this a sign that things were going wrong?""
No, no, you were the one that cared too hard, not them

Stay up every single night staring at your phone
Either attempting to gather up the courage to turn these demons, these constant reminders of your loneliness into nothing more than a bad dream
Or praying just for one second you could feel the warmth of equally returned love

Go out for coffee four times a week by yourself
Always bring your notebook, never stop writing
Leave little comics and thank you notes with your tip
Watch them smile as you get in your car

Always talk down on yourself whenever possible
My life is shit because I deserve it, right?
You must have done something really bad
And it's nearly impossible for you to cry now

Avoid your friends for weeks even though they're the only sense of consistency you have left in your life
If they really wanted to see you they'd come, but they won't
(Who cares?)

Allow yourself to lose interest in the things you love
Watch as you begin to take a backseat to the world around you, don't fight it
Become a secondary character in your own motion picture

But most importantly drown every single one of your feelings in old stolen rum
Learn to love the taste of it dripping down your throat
Find comfort in the warmth coming from your stomach
You're drinking bottled love now

You don't need other people to drive away your loneliness
You just needed to find a way to talk to it",Dandelion Hands,1967,"[39, 25, 14, 15, 20, 29, 42, 75]",8

Those awkward years have hurried by, why did they fly away? Why is it, sir children grow up to be people one day? What takes the place of climbing trees and dirty knees in the world outside? What is there for you I can buy?
If you wanted the world I'd surround it with a wall. I'd scrawl these words with letters ten feet tall, 'To Sir, With Love'
The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end. And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend. A friend who taught me right from wrong, weak from strong, that's a lot to learn. What can I give you in return?

239,I Had A Dream,"[Chorus: Young Thug]
I spent a hundred on my fit and it’s by Hundreds
I’ll do whatever for them hundreds, only hundreds
I spend them racks on my homies, but they one hundreds
I bangin' blood but all my hundreds, they blue hundreds
Keep it one thousand, I’m one thousand, I’m ten hundreds
Run hundreds extremely up and still don’t act funny
I'm a dream chaser, I'm chasin' nothin' else but money
I'm a dream chaser and I had a dream 'bout money

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I bought that brand new Rayful Edmond then I went and saw my bitch
And she said that make her pussy wet well girl come ride this dick
I’m the type to fuck yo ho, I won’t even lock her in
Let you fuck a nigga good, I don’t call her, I call her friend
I got it in by the 20, by the 10 I done been
Out in Paris with my niggas, bought some bottles, I'mma spend
Cause they go hard for me
Got niggas on [?] spendin' that hard money
And I know, shit, all my niggas 1 hundo
They was down when the money used to come slow
North side, south side, niggas cutthroat
Wrong time, outside, at yo front door
Fuck hoes, getting money, we don’t love those
You ain’t come for the money, what’d you come for?
Got a 7th in the Sprite, but I want mo
500 for the car, ho, hold up, hold up

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I spent a hundred on my fit and it’s by Hundreds
I’ll do whatever for them hundreds, only hundreds

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I’m a project breakin' on PJ
And my PJ came out a PJ
Bitch she wanna suck me up, that’s a survey
Me, Milly, and yo bitch, that’s a threeway
Roll it up, don’t smoke it, this persie
Run into my boys don’t persuade
Every time a nigga leave out the house got bands on me
And I’m feelin' myself like a nursery
Hickery, dickery, dock
I ride my Benzo to the stars
You better watch whoever mob
But any man take no mo
I got these bitches in a jar
I keep me some racks in a jar
I pull up not here, I’m fresh as a casket
Came from the dirt like a maverick
Only got choppas and I buy rounds by the hundreds
Choppa will make a nigga learn, call it phonics
Actin' like Arthur DW, boy you done with
I take a nap and I give a rack cause I’m dumb rich

There's a cat in the window
And he's watching all the birds go passing by
He'd love to fly out the window
Go where the wind goes
And so would I
Like that cat in the window
Who keeps wishing for some wings to take a ride
I'd love to glide to a rainbow
Off where the clouds go dancing by
And if I could fly
You wouldn't find me hangin' around
Watching the birds go by
Yes the cat in the window
Has a tear in his eye
I should leave today, fly away
Why should I stay like the cat in the window
Who keeps watching the birds
Go by from the window

Many have hopes and dreams that will not come true
And all of them left behind now they will live in you
Everyone feels the same once a day in the sun
But sometimes there is only room for one
Never ever been so near now the chance is finally here

This following program is dedicated to the city and people of San Francisco, who may not know it, but they are beautiful. And so is their city. This is a very personal song, so if the viewer cannot understand it, particularly those of you who are European residents, save up all your bread, and fly Trans-Love Airways to San Francisco, USA. Then, maybe, you’ll understand the song. It will be worth it, if not for the sake of this song, but for the sake of your own piece of mind

Strobe light beam, creates dreams
Walls move, minds do too
On a warm San Franciscan night

Old child , young child
Feel all right

On a warm San Franciscan night
Angels sing, leather wings
Jeans of blue, Harley Davidsons too
On a warm San Franciscan night

Old angel, young angel
Feel all right
On a warm San Franciscan night

I wasn't born there
Perhaps I'll die there
There's no place left to go

Cops face is filled with hate
Heavens above
He's on a street called ""Love""

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like

Or me undressed you like

When ev'ry night the set that's smart is
Intruding at nudist parties
In studios

Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her

When Rockefeller still can hoard en-
-ough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows

And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once had several chateaus
When folks who still can ride in jitneys
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys
Lack baby clothes
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Then 'Nana' shows
Anything goes
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up-
On her toes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got

Can broadcast abed from Simmons

But see G we all be out here scrapping packing macs when
Friends oughta be out here cracking helping to seconds black men
Been struggling for too long and isn't stopping
I know the hoods all good but still on wood I'm knocking
But damn I feel as though I'm 'bout to fall apart
See bangin's in my soul but survivals in my heart


(Chorus - L.V):
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's in the hood

(Verse 4 - Havikk the Rhime Son):
I'm lyrically raw second it no prom i'm dumping on quits
I'll have them say raw so giving me deals on body bags (you Busters want some?)
My dogs will say my dilly is kind of scary when I'm feeling grabbing a Nine
From the spine I'm checking the chain (and popping a clip in)
I'm dumping on hoods and chumps
I'm out here with gauges and pumps
I'm leaving your mark black and heart
Cuz haven't got luck from the start
Deflating love with these slugs G
Just recognize these zello z's spinning like these doubling up like keys

(Verse 5 - Jayo Felony)
I'm crimin' and grimin' if i don't get mine I'm coming up in the click
Here's a stick what kind of stick loc a sherm stick
Let it burn quick pull it up pump to the rescue
Always running your trap with the strap I'm ready to test you
From the STC to the CPT my clique gon' get there bang on
I see your G rolling for these NAC we slang on
One time swoop they making it hot in the hood
But they didn't sweat the warrant so I knocked on wood

(Chorus - L.V):
(Knock on wood) It's all about the G's living good

252,Ballad Of You & Me & Pooneil,"If you were a bird and you lived very high
You leaned on the wind when the breeze came by
Say to the wind as it took you away
""That's where I wanted to go today""
And I do know that I need to have you around
And I do know...
I do know that I need to have you around

Love like a mountain springtime
Flashing through the rivers of my mind;
It's what I feel for you

You and me go walking south
And we see all the world around us
The colors blind my eyes and my mind to all but you
And I do know that I need to have you around
And I do...
I do know that I need to have you around

I have a house where I can go
When there's too many people around me;
I can sit and then watch all the people
Down below goin' by me;
Halfway down the stair is a stair
Where I sit and think about you and me;

But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky
When I die
(When I die)
When I'm high
(When I die)
When I die

If you were a cloud and you sailed up there
You sail on water as blue as air
You'd see me here in the fields and say
""Doesn't the sky look green today?""

But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky
When I die
(When I die)
When I die
When I'm high
When I die
Die, die, die, die",Jefferson Airplane,1967,"[47, 42, 42, 54, 64, 84]",6
253,Put Your Mind At Ease,"[Intro: Ruth B]
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

[Chorus: Abstract & Ruth B]
Peter Pan, that's what they call me (Call me)
I promise that you'll never be lonely (Lonely)
Peter Pan, that's what they call me (Call me)
I promise that you'll never be lonely (Lonely)
Peter Pan, that's what they call me (Call me)
I promise that you'll never be lonely (Lonely)

[Post-Chorus: Ruth B]
And ever since that day

[Verse 1: Abstract]
In these fast times, chasing lifelines for a lifetime
I've had my heart in the right place at the wrong time
With the right girl in another world, maybe we would be together still
If you hear this and resent that, I don't give a shit I'll let it spill
I don't give a damn, I'll keep it real
'Cause by now I hope you know the drill
I would never lie; young forever, I ain't ever gonna die
Told me, ""Grow up,"" but I went and showed 'em why
I could make it, I showed 'em the power in youth, power in truth
The younger you stay, the closer you are to your roots, that's the reason I do
I can teach how to hit the skies
Rise above 'em without getting high
But if it help a bit, take a lil' hit
Take a lil' sip, put your mind at ease
Swear you got the keys, you can have your dreams
That's up to you, not what others believe, jeez
I swear that's the part that took longest for me
'Cause when I drop into a beat
I detach from the world, view it under my feet
Orbit around with my dreams and there I perceive my reality and what it means
Music is where I can breathe, a world in between
What I am, what I was, what I will be
It's the only place that I feel free, hope you feel me

[Pre-Chorus: Ruth B]
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, lost boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality, he said

[Chorus: Ruth B]
Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely
Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely
Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely

[Post-Chorus: Ruth B]
And ever since that day

[Verse 2: Abstract]
You ain't ever gotta be alone
I found company inside a song
Take it off your chest, throw it in a poem
If they try to flex, show 'em where you going
Hating on your past, kill 'em with your moment
When you get the chance, drive it like you stole it
She said, ""I don't want to grow up
I gotta go keep my passions alive
Please say you've heard of a place I can fly
Where nothing's impossible, that's where I gotta go""
They said the only way up was to get in line
I'm telling you that somebody lied
As someone who's been to the other side
Blurring the lines between earth and mind
She's a lost girl in a lost world, but I know what she tryna find
Some call it music; I call it Neverland
Where we can take flight and don't have to ever land
You can stay young forever if you follow your heart
Know a nine-to-five tear the soul apart
Keep it safe, you can keep your soul in art
We can't live a lie, we would rather die
If I don't live for this, I am not alive
I don't deserve the breath, I don't deserve the steps
Don't deserve the criticism or compliments
This is who I am, this is what I do
Outside of Neverland, I don't have a clue
They call us lost, but this is the place where I was found
Take my hand, Wendy, we're home now

[Pre-Chorus: Ruth B]
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, lost boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality

[Chorus: Abstract & Ruth B]
Peter Pan, that's what they call me (Call me)
I promise that you'll never be lonely (Lonely)
Peter Pan, that's what they call me (Call me)
I promise that you'll never be lonely (Lonely)
Peter Pan, that's what they call me (Call me)
I promise that you'll never be lonely (Lonely)

[Post-Chorus: Ruth B]

And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

I'm known for my glamour and my glitz, check it

As I bust, I really must encrust
This microphone rust with Diamond fairy dust

I don't wear Crocs and I don't wear sandals
The pump don't work cause the vandals took the handle

Stop singing that song in the wrong key
What you looking at? Funky donkey
Funky donkey
Funky donkey

I-I-I-I-I go woooo-ooo like a fire engine
Flashing lights to get your attention

Stop sweating me about the weather
Go shave a sheep and knit yourself a sweater

Don't get me heated or y'all in trouble
Bass is booming make the dancehall bubble

Letting loose, up in the honkey tonk
With the shoopa doopa doo bedonk

Well, I was swimming in the water of the ocean
Like Dr. Jekyll with the magic potion

We're brand new, never ever the same

258,Ode To Billy Joe,"It was the third of June
Another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out chopping cotton
And my brother was baling hay
And at dinner time we stopped
And walked back to the house to eat

And Mama hollered out the back door
Y'all remember to wipe your feet
And then she said
I got some news this morning from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister
Jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Papa said to Mama
As he passed around the black eyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense
Pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow

And Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothing ever comes
To no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected
When he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back
At the Carroll County picture show

And wasn't I talking to him
After church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece of apple pie
You know it don't seem right

I saw him at the sawmill
Yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me
Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Mama said to me
Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning
And you haven't touched a single bite

That nice young preacher
Brother Taylor dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday
Oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl
That looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe
Was throwing something off the Tallahatchie Bridge

A year has come 'n' gone
Since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson
They bought a store in Tupelo

There was a virus going 'round
Papa caught it and he died last spring
And now Mama doesn't seem
To wanna do much of anything

And me
I spend a lot of time
Pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water
Off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ashley Gearing,1967,"[89, 94]",2

To make you laugh, I would be a fool for you

Everything there was dark and dirty
Outside my window was a steeple
With a clock that always said ""12:30""

Young girls are coming to the canyon
And in the mornings I can see them walking
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
And I can’t keep myself from talking

At first so strange to feel so friendly
To say good morning and really mean it
To feel these changes happening in me
But not to notice till I feel it

Young girls are coming to the canyon
And in the morning I can see them walking
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
And I can’t keep myself from talking

Cloudy waters cast no reflection
Images of beauty lie there stagnant
Vibrations bounce in no direction
And lie there shattered into fragments

Young girls are coming to the canyon
And in the morning I can see them walking
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
And I can’t keep myself from talking",The Mamas & The Papas,1967,"[23, 20, 20, 27, 36, 72]",6

Verse 1:
Shall we ballet
As if we’re gliding on the water
A little bit more
Pointed toe

Rainy saturday
Until this rain stops
Take me dancing
Over and over again

Hook:
Since morning you and I wait for the rain

With you in this weather
I can't believe how happy I am
Oh, she’s wet

Over the blue fence

Chorus:
Towards the sky.. jump
Spread your wings and turn
In rain or shine
We just dancing in the rain

Verse 2:
We're living for love
The one who recognized me
I match my steps with yours and I’m dancing with you

Let’s go higher
We’re in a trance
In the fog the rain drenches us more

Hook:
Since morning you and I wait for the rain

With you in this weather
I can't believe how happy I am
Oh, she’s wet

Over the blue fence

Chorus:
Towards the sky.. jump
Spread your wings and turn
In rain or shine
We just dancing in the rain

270,There's Always Me,"[Verse 1]
When the evening shadows fall
And you're wondering who to call
For a little company
There's always me

[Verse 2]
If your great romance should end
And you're lonesome for a friend
Darling you need never be
There's always me

[Verse 3]
I don't seem to mind somehow
Playing second fiddle now
Someday you'll want me, dear
And when that day is here

[Verse 4]
Within my arms you'll come to know
Other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be eternally
Look around and you will see
There's always me",Elvis Presley,1967,"[62, 56, 56, 58, 74, 90]",6
271,It Could Be We're In Love,"Fairs-Kerley

Didn't it seem right
To walk along the sand last night
And to gaze out at the night
Through your window

Just the way things are
Can be reflected in a star
And you don't stop to think
It could be that we're in love
Could be we're in love

To walk along the sand
You don't have to understand
What the world is really like
Outside your window

And didn't it seem right
To walk along the sand last night
And not stop to think
It could be that we're in love
Could be we're in love
Could be we're in love
Could be we're in love

And I don't want to go
You know I love her so
And I don't want to go
You know I love her so

272,Louisiana Man,"At first Mom an' Poppa called their little girl, Lady
They raised her on the banks of a river bed

A house boat tied to a big, tall tree
A home for my Poppa an' my Momma and me

The clock strikes three Poppa jumps to his feet
Already Momma's cookin' Poppa somethin' to eat
At half-past Poppa he's a-ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

He's got fishin' line strung across the Louisiana River
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's settin' his traps catchin' anythin' he can
He's gotta make a livin', he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin', he's a Louisiana man

Muskrat hides hangin' by the dozen
Even got a little bitty muskrat cousin
Got 'em out dryin' in the hot, hot sun
Tomorrow Poppa's gonna turn 'em into mon'

They call Momma Rita and my Daddy Jack
My little baby brother on the floor that's Mac
Rhett and Lynn are the family twins
Big brother Eddie's on the bayou fishin'

On the river floats Poppa's great big boat
That's how me and Poppa get in to town
It takes every bit of a night and day
To even reach a place where the people will stay

Oh, I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my Poppa takes the furs to town
Poppa done promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I saw the cowboys and injuns for the first time then
I told my Poppa ""Gotta go again""
Poppa says ""Hon', we got lines to run
We'll have to come again 'cause there's work to be done""

He's got fishin' line strung across the Louisiana River
Got a catch a big fish for us to eat
He's settin' his traps catchin' anythin' he can
Gotta make a livin', he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin', he's a Louisiana man",Bobbie Gentry,1967,"[97, 98, 98]",3

You know that I would be a liar

The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn their song
They serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Sunday)
Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care

See Mrs. Gray she's proud today
Because her roses are in bloom
And Mr. Green he's so serene
He's got a TV in every room

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Sunday)
Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand

To places far away
I need a change of scenery

275,Thank The Lord For The Night Time,"Daytime turns me off
And I don't mean maybe
Nine to five
Ain't takin' me where I'm bound
When it's done
I run out to see my baby
We got groovin'
When the sun goes down

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation, it's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you

I'll talk about plans now
Baby, I got plenty
Nothing ever seems to turn out
The way it should
Talk about money, girl
I ain't got any
Seems like just one time
I'm feeling good

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation, it's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you

Seems like just one time
I'm feeling good

Love just walked in on me
And it's taken me by surprise
Happiness surrounds me

What your love has done for me

Oh girl, what your love has done for me

Hum - mmmm luscious
Sure been delicious to me
Hear me now, hum-mmmmmmm
Luscious, sure been delicious to me

Once I was a hollow man
In which a lonely heart did dwell
Then love came sneaking up on me
Bringing hope to an empty shell
Now I've heard so many times before
That your love can be so bad
But I just want to tell you people
It's the best love I ever had

Talkin' 'bout, I just want to testify
What your love has done for me
Everybody sing (oh girl) I just want to testify
What your love has done for me

Black Knights, the moder-en day N.W.A
Cali's finest gangster rap rhyme writers these streets ever raised
Renegades, bustin off guns, definately
If I gotta go out, you're comin with me, like 50/50
Split decision, Doc. Doom, the rugged rhyme physician
Talk rude, bubble-goose, straight outta Hell's kitchen
Verbal hitman, Bobby Steels' ditch-diggin henchman
Monkey wrench men, I stay up in the war trenches
Of L.A., put a hole through yo' eniche
Hey Mr. D.J., the Knights is here so let the beats play
We rhyme for eons, way beyond your small flow
You dynamite niggas'll rhyme, our click is all pro

Divide the code of honor, kill or be killed at any time
Mathematically enclined, walk, talk with my mind
I pack metal, black gats, stainless steel swords for war
Black Knights attack, crash your coast, waves by shore
Young hitman, body ? until we master samurai style
Chop your neck, some niggas funny style
Check my war file, from Compton to Staten Isle
I left my trademark, Ghost Dog after the gun bark
Here's a book to read, like weed'll leave your brain sparked
Plant seeds, caught three to seam, got dark
The final shootout, live by the code, die by the code
Empty on your half ass niggas and then I reload

No jokes, we smoke for comin with the rumble coats
Hitman, bullets rippin through flesh, flesh
Supreme penetration, enter your back, exit your chest
One marinate, cardi-inch roast, trapped in your neck
In this war zone, seven get throne, six connect
Discipli' incest, scorpion sting, kiss of death
In this genevese, clappin enemies, clearin facilities
You want drama? We can draw blood, I do the honor
Street novelist, pure dominence, you know the motto bitch
Knights is nothin luckin in the game so fuck bluffin
Cause mass destruction, leave bodies floatin in the Hudson
For the CREAM I'm lustin, the better thing the cheddar brings
From the get-go, we have this shit sewed, so check the zip code

[Куплет 1: Magg '98 + Cheenah + Скриптонит + Kolyaolya]
Это жизнь молодых поэтов, жизнь молодых боссов
Братья рядом, братья в Москоу, кайф на связи, ведь он свой в доску
(При виде нас) они сияют вмиг и распускают косы
Я не хочу их видеть завтра и я не буду дарить им розы (ни ху-я!)
(Никакой любви) никаких отношений
Девочки на раз — они словно мишени
(Никакой любви), расставаний, прощений
Эти суки хотят тусоваться (эй, мелкий, отшей их)
Все эти суки вытворяют похлеще топа избранных фильмов
Что ты видел в подростковый период, но с тех времён ты всё так же наивен
В ожидании куска, но объедки рядом — и их не прикрыли
И к чему стремится самый сок? (Ты знаешь), ведь наша дыра — холодильник
Чтобы пригрели так, как в Tor'e ты по сети
Но всё что есть — это грязь, ты в ней по уши, осмотрись
Все гадюшники города ждут-временят-ожидают тебя в перспективе
И от безвыхода крутишь-вертишь вокруг нас, будто на гриле, хули, кадиле
Где твой огромный зад? Вверх-вниз
Мы знаем, что он хочет — оставлять твоего парня забытым (да-а), ты вся в моём распоряжении
Где твой огромный зад? Вверх-вниз (вверх-вниз). Весь в пиве
А твоя подра валит домой, ведь её кости не в нашем стиле

[Предприпев: Benz + Kolyaolya]
Бар «Две лесбухи», пырло, гашик, ящик «Миллер»
Бармен, прогоняем выпить, на сегодня ты их киллер, убей
Убей их за мой счёт, ещё, отправь их за мой стол, ещё
Пока суки втихаря в уборной делят колесо (да-да)

[Припев: Скриптонит]
Так много сук за пресс сделает всё, что придумал мой кент (их лес)
Так много сук на вес слетается вмиг (толкая всех сук вокруг)
Так много разных лесб при виде котлет могут забыть подруг
Так много разных мест, но наше любимое — бар «Две лесбухи»

[Куплет 2: 104 + Truwer]
Я люблю женщин и их обилие, есть варик — я зову её мобильная
Есть другой: умеет как на DVD, но она на 7 из 10, если ты пьёшь до утра, то зови её
Честен с ними, как ни с кем другим, в путешествии — джин, тропы и круги
От больших проблем, как филе у Ким, тебя ждёт твой кент, воскресай и жги
Она не спеша греет танцпол, пацы тут и там с нею понеслись
Она ловит свист, она ловит пол, я её тяну не на пару слов
Также хороша в майке босиком, вижу этот взгляд, глаза вверх-вниз
Она ловит свист, она ловит пол, она сука та ещё, но мне похуй

[Бридж: Kolyaolya + (Скриптонит)]
(Девять, девять)
Девять сучек у моих ног, 36-63 на связи
36-63 на связи, все как будто Лука Брази
Мои сёстры не святые, мои деньги быстрей «Ламбо»
Мои деньги все цветные, в этих сучках всего полно
Девять сучек у моих ног, 36-63 на связи
36-63 на связи, все как будто Лука Брази (у)
Мои сёстры не святые, мои деньги быстрей «Ламбо»
Мои деньги все цветные, в этих сучках всего полно

Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free
So far away from you and all your charm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

Each night in dreams I see your face
Memories and time cannot erase
Then I awake and find you're gone
Then I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from you so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep

If you find the bottled message that I wrote, I hope you read
It's been floating for some time, was assuming you'd never see
Out at sea, it gets lonely in a way that's so unique

286,You're A Very Lovely Woman,"[Verse 1]
You're a very lovely woman
But I think I'd better turn you down this time
Cause you've used all of your charms on me
And I kind of miss the things I left behind

A girl who loves me is thinking of me
My home and friends
But you're a lovely woman (a very lovely woman)
Lovely woman (a very lovely woman)

And now you ask me to forget
The things it took me long to get and find
And go away with you again
And follow you in sin and drink your wine

I've made my mind up
I will not wind up a life in sin
But you're a lovely woman (a very lovely woman)
A very lovely woman (a very lovely woman)

And oh, even though you're lovely
Your world is ugly, so come back no more
For all that you have to offer
Is not enough to ruin my life for

You're a very lovely woman
Very lovely, yes you are

And oh, even though you're lovely
Your world is ugly, so come back no more
For all that you have to offer
Is not enough to ruin my life for

So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust

Once when you walked beside me
That inconceivable, that unbelievable world we knew
When we two were in love

And every bright neon sign turned into stars
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours
Each road that we took turned into gold
But the dream was too much for you to hold

Now over and over I keep going over the world we knew
Days when you used to love me

291,Heroes And Villains,"I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Home of the heroes and villains

Once at night cotillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain
Of the bullets that eventually brought her down

But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Na, na, na, na, na

Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

In the cantina
Margarita keeps the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and 'round in the warmth
Her body fanned the flame of the dance
Dance Margarita, don't you know that I love you?
Dance

You're under arrest

My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe healthy weathy and wise

I've been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff, I'm alright
By the heroes and

Chorus
Ha! Ha! Said the clown
Has the king lost his crown
Is the knight being tight on romance?
Ha! Ha! Said the clown
Is it bringing you down
That you've lost your chance?

Feeling low, gotta go
See a show in town
Hear the jokes, have a smoke
And a laugh at the clown
In a whirl, see a girl
With a smile in her eyes
Never thought I'd be brought
Right down by her lies

In a trance, watch her dance
To the beat of the drums
Faster now, sweating brow
I'm all the fingers and thumbs
Wonder why I hit the sky
When she blows me a kiss
In a while run a mile
I'm regretting all this

Chorus

Time to go, close the show
Wave the people good-bye
Grab my coat, grab my hat
Look that girl in the eye
Where's your home?
What's your phone number?
Stop fooling 'round
Could have died, she replied
""I'm the wife of the clown.""

Let your soft gentle hands caress my body

Tell me what he's got that I can't give you

You took an awful chance to be with another man
So tell me what he's got that I ain't got

Laura, see these walls that I built for you
Laura, see this carpet that I laid
See those fancy curtains on the windows
Touch those satin pillows on your bed

Laura, count the dresses in your closet
Note the name upon the checkbook in your bag
And if there's time before I pull this trigger
Then tell me what he's got that I ain't got

Tell me what he's got that I can't give you
Must be something I was born without

I can take it away and say that it's mine
He smiles from a distance and lives in a tree
Holding out a welcome hand, just for you and me

Money is chocolate, wrapped in a silver cloud
Everybody would, but no one is allowed
There's no tomorrow, only today
When it rains, it rains lemonade

So come with me and meet a man
Whose job it is, is selling all this time
Before he spreads his wings and starts to flying 'round the sky

People are shadows, trapped in a golden well
And only children's eyes can break the spell
They live in a land where the clocks grow on trees
And words sound just like a cool summer breeze

I know that this man who does sell time
Is someone who's lying deep in my mind
It's all sad to think that there is such a man
When you're lonely you can join me in his hand

Whose job it is, is selling all this time

Hey, Carrie Anne

When we were at school, our games were simple
I played the janitor, you played a monitor
Then you played with older boys and prefects
What's the attraction in what they're doing?

Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?

You were always something special to me
Quite independent, never caring
You lost your charm as you were aging
Where is your magic disappearing?

Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?

You're so, so like a woman to me (So like a woman to me)
So, so like a woman to me (So, so like a woman to me)

Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?

People live and learn but you're still learning
You use my mind and I'll be your teacher
When the lesson's over, you'll be with me
Then I'll hear the other people saying

Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?

304,To Love Somebody,"[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got you? Hey babe

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so so sorrily blind
I'm a man, can't you see
What I am
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got? Hey babe

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like

305,A Whiter Shade Of Pale,"[Verse 1]
We skipped the light fandango
And turned cartwheels cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
And the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waitress brought a tray

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Verse 2]
She said There is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Were leaving for the coast
Although both my eyes were wide-open
They might just just have well been closed

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Verse 3 (In Concert)]
She said she wanted shore leave
Tho in truth we were at sea
So I took her by a looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying you must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride
Well she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died
And so it was",Willie Nelson,1967,"[44, 16, 10, 9, 7, 5, 5, 8, 10, 13, 28, 80]",12

I say the money and betrayal got my mind hypnotized

Lies, that's what they told me
I never asked for shit at night, only for you to hold me
I did it out of love, baby, never said you owed me
Now I don't wanna fuck with you, it's gonna kill me slowly
Straight out that north, I made it out, don't mix me in the shit they say
My feelings fallin', money callin', how we movin', shit ain't safe
I'm roamin' through LA alone with a burner on my waist
At night, I pray I make it home, them pussy boys know where I stay, might jump the gate
But fuck that, I'm strapped up, ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Somethin' must be in them nigga's head wrong if they thinkin', I ain't clutchin'
Can't take cover when I start bustin'
Leave 'em like one said they love me
Patrol still wanna cuff me
No love for one, say fuck me
You supposed to be the one I run to, but you ain't 'round
Never knew to succumb to, I don't know how
I lost my love for that dream and I don't know if it could be found
You always bringin' some shit up, never once tried to put you down

Nobody I'm trustin'
Straight out of them trenches, I'm thuggin'
To me you the world, but I never could tell you wasn't keepin' it real
You was billing your budget
You see me with bitches you think that I cherish
You ask them a question, they can't tell you nothin'
Bad news and it's comin' out ugly
Truth be told, you was plottin' on somethin'
Money mean nothin' when you really love someone
How I be livin' take up time and we could have a one on one
And fuckin' off ain't that important when you really for someone
I'm scared to open up my heart, I always been so nonchalant
I just wanna live with you, build with you, smoke with you, yeah
I know you think the shit I say
But you just wanna misuse me and lie, said that I ain't never cared
You left yo' diary by the bed

Pallid white was the color of his lifeless skin
Blue was the color of the morning sky
From the ground where he died
It was the last thing that was seen by him

Black and white was the question that so bothered him
He never asked he was taught not to ask
But was on his lips as they buried him

321,A Woman's Hands,"[Verse 1]
Tell me why when you put a camera on a thug
The first thing out of his mouth is I wanna thank my mama?
And some say that causes drama
But it's subliminal, there's no efforts needed
It's like pouring water on the ground that's seeded
And you know it happens all the time, so I need to ask this question

[Chorus]
Why oh why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Verse 2]
Now tell me what turns a boy into a thug just as soon as he leave the house
See he don't have a man to give him little rules, so he don't be running in and out
But it's okay 'cause mama's there
And mama's doing the best she could ever do
But the funny thing is when it's all said and done
She probably did it better than you could ever do

[Chorus]
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Bridge]
Tell me how will a boy learn to stand on his own?
How can he make it all alone? How can he be responsible?
If he don't have his daddy to show him how to be there
Not to minimize what his mama does for him
I'm just saying he gon' need ya'll both
Can you tell me why why why
Does it gotta be so hard to do a daddy's job?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be man

[Chorus]
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Outro]
When you missing his first game, don't even know the boy's nickname
That's a damn shame 'cause you suppose to be the man
The daddy, the father, the boy's role model
That's supposed to be you, that's supposed to be you",Trey Songz,1967,"[69, 63, 63, 78, 83]",5
322,Sixteen Tons,"[Verse 1]
Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 2]
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, ""Well-a bless my soul!""

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 3]
I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the cane break by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 4]
If you see me comin' better step aside
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?

323,Stout-Hearted Men,"You who have dreams
If you act, they'll come true
To turn your dreams to a fact

Hearts can inspire
Other hearts with their fire
For the strong obey
When a strong man shows them the way
Give me some men who are stout-hearted men
Who will fight for the right they adore
Start me with ten who are stout-hearted men
And I'll soon give you ten thousand more-ore

They grow as they go to the fore
Then there's nothing in the world
Can halt or mar a plan
When stout-hearted men
Can stick together - man - to man...

324,Paper Sun,"So you think you're having good times
With the boy that you just met
Kicking sand from beach to beach
Your clothes are soaking wet
But if you look around and see
A shadow on the run
Don't be too upset because it's just a paper sun

Ahh Paper Sun
Ahh Paper Sun

In the room where you've been sleeping
All your clothes are thrown about
Cigarettes burn window sills
Your meter's all run out
But then again it's nothing
You just split when day is done
Hitching lifts to nowhere, hung up on the paper sun

Standing in the cool of my room
Fresh cut flowers give me sweet perfume
Too much sun will burn!

When you're feeling tired and lonely
You see people going home
You can't make the train fare
Or the sixpence for the phone
And icicles you're crying
Down your cheek have just begun
Don't be sad, good times are had
Beneath the paper sun

Daylight breaks while you sleep on the sand
A seagull is stealing the ring from your hand
The boy who had given you so much fun
Has left you so cold in the paper sun",Traffic (UK),1967,[94],1
325,Penny Arcade,"I've been young for a long time
If you live outside of society you are not subject to the same law of aging
Because aging in a specific way is a construct
Human beings are herd animals
Pack animals
& they like to fit in
They don't like outsiders
That's the whole tribal thing
Humans tend to worship outsiders only with some distance
That's why it went so well for Jesus after they killed him",Franz Nicolay,1967,[95],1
326,Come On Sock It To Me,"[Verse 1]
Oh, we were strangers in a really big city
Got excited by the sound of a party
Now my heart beat while the music was grooving
And if you wanted to, you couldn't keep from moving
Look around, do you believe what you seeing
The walls are moving, the ceiling's a-reeling

[Verse 2]
Couples over in the corner romancing
Oh, the boys are witness some outta sight dancing
Gotta girl giving me some lessons
And now she's gonna be my obsession
Aren't you glad we found our way in here
Put another record up on the player

[Verse 3]
Hey, there's a stoned party dancing with the police
Don't have to worry about disturbing the peace
Met a fine chick that really got to me
Good Lord, how she boogalooed to me
Oh my, how she boogalooed it to me
Come on, sock it, sock it to me

One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice

And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call...
He called Alice
When she was just small

Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice

I'm getting hysterical, praying he'll walk through the door

(Last-minute miracle) is all I do

343,Drums,"[Verse 1]
I can feel the earth begin to move
I hear my needle hit the groove
And spiral through another day
I hear my song begin to say
Kiss me where the sun don’t shine
The past was yours
But the future’s mine
You’re all out of time

[Verse 2]
I don’t feel too steady on my feet
I feel hollow I feel weak
Passion fruit and holy bread
Fill my guts and ease my head
Through the early morning sun
I can see her, here she comes
She bangs the drums

Have you seen her, have you heard
The way she plays, there are no words
To describe the way I feel
How could it ever come to pass
She’ll be the first, she’ll be the last

The way I feel

Have you seen her, have you heard
The way she plays, there are no words
To describe the way I feel

Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch

That you're glad I'm gone
Do you tell them how you cried
Whenever you were all alone

We both know for us
There'll never, never be another
So forget about your foolish pride
And let's get back together

Listen
Who cares who was right or wrong
I just know I need you
And by your side is where I belong

Don't you miss me a little bit baby
'Cause I'm missing you
Say you miss me a little bit baby

You think you take me back
People will call you a fool
Deep down inside you know you need me
As much as I need you

You're only making things tougher

Who cares who was right or wrong
I just need you baby
'Cause by your side is where I belong

Don't you miss me a little bit baby
Please tell me that you do
Say you miss me a little bit baby

Girl, I walk these streets day and night
Alone and downhearted
Every doggone day baby
Since we've been parted

Aimlessly with no sense of direction
Baby I'm trying to tell you
I need your sweet love and affection
Yes I do (yes I do)
Can't make it without you (I need you)
Oh yeah (yes I do)

This loneliness and separation
Makes too high a price to pay
When two people love each other the way we do
Should nothing stand in their way

You're making a mountain out of a molehill
Because of your pride
You're letting a little misunderstanding
Push true love aside

Who cares who was right or wrong
Just say you want me back baby
And I come running, running back home

Don't you miss me a little bit baby",Marvin Gaye,1967,"[68, 68, 70, 73, 93]",5

353,Gentle On My Mind,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughnin' coal pile, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mind",The Band Perry,1967,"[74, 62, 62, 65, 68, 85, 100]",7

362,Society's Child (Baby I've Been Thinking),"Come to my door, baby
Face is clean and shining black as night
My mother went to answer you know
That you looked so fine
Now I could understand your tears and your shame
She called you ""boy"" instead of your name
When she wouldn't let you inside
When she turned and said
""But honey, he's not our kind.""

She says
I can't see you any more, baby
Can't see you anymore

Walk me down to school, baby
Everybody's acting deaf and dumb
Until they turn and say, ""Why don't you stick to your own kind.""
My teachers all laugh, the smirking stares
Cutting deep down in our affairs
Preachers of equality
Think they believe it, then why won't they just let us be?

They say I can't see you anymore baby
Can't see you anymore

One of these days I'm gonna stop my listening
Gonna raise my head up high
One of these days I'm gonna raise up my glistening wings and fly
But that day will have to wait for a while
Baby I'm only society's child

But for now this is the way, they must remain

Darling, there comes a time in everybody's life

That being loved is more important than painting the town
Only noon and night
Cause my life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time they go dim
But your love and tender arms, I can always come home to them

[Verse 2]
I used to have more friends than I could count
But now all of my so-called friends are gone
Cause I've lost everything in my bank account

So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
Cause if I don't have a dime, I know your love is mine

Darling, everybody need somebody, o I need you
I know now, nobody really loves me, honey honey honey, the way you do

366,Show Business,"[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs
At all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business?
And you think that you got what it takes?
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out!

[Chorus: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The business)
The ups and downs with the hoes (The business)
Always getting fronted on at shows (The business)
People gotta stick their nose (In the business)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the gains just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say ""Where's my loot?""
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cause you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, ""More soup with your meal?""
Cause this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg]
Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cause they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cause your lyrics is butt

[Chorus: All]
Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)

[Verse 5: Sadat X]
The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
""Oh, he's a cutie"", yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs, I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game and I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

[Verse 6: Diamond D]
Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing (""Boy, get a job"")
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
(For what?) That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile

If your love I couldn't call my own

I need your love in every way
Your love I cling to
When things slip away
Without your love
I'll be lost and alone
No reason for living
All purpose would be gone
Without you there
For my eyes to behold
My life would be empty
My heart would grow cold

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone

When I think of love
I think of me and you
When I think of happiness
I think of us too
You're my yesterdays
And all my tomorrows
The air I breathe
Everything I need
If from my life
You were ever gone
I'd fall to pieces
You I depend on

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone

Darling without you
I'll go on searching
With a lonely heart
That won't stop hurting
Sorrow would be written
On my face
All my tears
Would leave its trace
I would be like a statue in a park
Cold and alone
A man without a heart

If you take your love from me
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone

Turn to stone, turn to stone
Just turn to stone, I'll turn to stone
If your love I couldn't call my own

370,Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine,"McDonald

She hides in an attic concealed on a shelf
Behind volumes of literature based on herself
And runs across the pages like some tiny elf
Knowing that it's hard to find
Stuff way back in her mind
Winds up spending all of her time
Trying to memorize every line
Sweet Lorraine, ah sweet Lorraine

Sweet lady of death wants me to die
So she can come sit by my bedside and sigh
And wipe away the tears from all my friends eyes
Then softly she will explain
Just exactly who was to blame
For causing me to go insane
And finally blow out my brain
Sweet Lorraine, ah sweet Lorraine

Well you know that it's a shame and a pity
You were raised up in the city
And you never learned nothing 'bout country ways
Ah 'bout country ways

The joy of life she dresses in black
With celestial secrets engraved in her back
And her face keeps flashing that she's got the knack
But you know when you look into her eyes
All she's learned she's had to memorize
And the only way you'll ever get her high
Is to let her do her thing and then watch you die
Sweet Lorraine, ah sweet Lorraine

Now she's the one who gives us all those magical things
And reads us stories out of the I Ching
Then she passes out a whole new basket of rings
That when you put on your hand
Makes you one of the Angel Band
And gives you the power to be a man
But what it does for her you never quite understand
Sweet Lorraine, ah sweet Lorraine

Well you know that it's a shame and a pity
You were raised up in the city
And you never learned nothing 'bout country ways
Oh 'bout country ways, oh 'bout country ways
Yeah about country ways, oh country ways ...",Country Joe and the Fish,1967,"[95, 95]",2
371,Along Comes Mary,"[Verse 1]
Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time at rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

[Chorus 1]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to give me kicks and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

[Verse 2]
When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness
Is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes
At who is most to blame today

[Chorus 2]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much, when told that such a tender touch of hers
Will make them not the same

[Verse 3]
And when the morning of the warning's passed the gassed and flaccid kids
Are flung across - the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone the songs are left unsung
And hung upon - the scars

[Chorus 3]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes, reflect the lies, and make them realize
Their urgent cry for sight no more

[Outro]
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch",Bloodhound Gang,1967,"[96, 96]",2

I was driving doing nothing on the shores of Great Salt Lake
When they put it on the air, I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myself and I forgot about the brake
I forgot about all laws and I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9 and all across the Amy band
Across the road they were turning around and headed south with me
It got so crowded on the road I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared but my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud, it seems that everybody heard
Everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills
Then I heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird

That the world in black
Is upon your back
And your body shakes
So you ditch away
And you close the shades
Don't try to do it
Don't try to kill your time
You might do it
Then you can't change your mind
You've got a hold on to your time
Till you break through these
Times of trouble
When you try to talk
And the words get hard
And they put you down
Don't you stay
Don't you ditch away
I saw you singing
Swinging your mother's sword
I know you're playing but
Sometimes the rules get hard
But if somebody left you out on a ledge
If somebody pushed you over the edge
If somebody loved you and left you for dead
You got to hold on to your time till you break
Through these times of trouble",Pearl Jam,1967,"[90, 90]",2

403,Happy And Me,"It seems like only yesterday that we rode the range together
The prairie skies and tumbleweeds just as far as we could see
Then, you grew up and drifted on, but I know that you remember
When you were a saddle pal to Hoppy, Gene and Me
Freckle faced and skinned up knees
You helped us trap the bad guys
With a five cent bag of popcorn
And a cap gun by your side
You know, time has a way of changin' things
Soon, there was your first love
You thought it would last forever
But when she left, you cried
But Hoppy, Gene and Me
We taught you how to shoot straight
And a cowboy's never cryin'
That's how it had to be

With Hoppy, Gene and Me
At last you found your real true love
And now you look so happy
Is that your little cowpoke
You're bouncin' on your knee
Well the prairie sky is just as blue
And life's like a rainbow
Just like you, he'll be a saddle pal

Where will it end

Part of it isn't our own
Are we less guilty
Who place in their way
Too many things
That lead them astray
Like too much money to spend
And too much idle time
Too many movies
The kind of passion and crime

Encouraged to roam

And they don't write the books
And they don't go out
And paint gay pictures

And they don't run the bars
And they don't make the laws
And they don't buy the cars
They don't peddle junk that
Well, that addles the brain
That's all done by older folks, man
Greedy for gain
Delinquent teenagers, oh, man
How quick we do condemn
The sins of a nation
And then go and blame it on them
But the laws that are blameless

Among us to cast the first stone
For in so many cases

When through the sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
Warm as the sunlight shining on her head

I want to take her in my arms
The ache is there so deep inside me

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And then my Mary wakes to love and love again

And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share
We share together

Kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair

Of any century?

Fish aren't biting but I don't really care and don't hurry
Like that Wabash River there I'd be drinking
Or laying dead somewhere if it wasn't for the Wabash River
If it wasn't for the Wabash River and this willow tree and my pole and a line
I'd be going crazy as an Indiana cyclone
Drowning memories of her and crying, crying, crying
If it wasn't for the Wabash River I'd be going out off my mind

You know, I just might change my mind before we get there

You sound like you got no control over whether you go or not

[Verse 3] [Fisherman]
That's just it, what is it about a woman that makes such a dummy out of a man
She was wild even when she was loving me, man
I knew tomorrow it'd likely be somebody else she would be with
But you know just that idea that the next day she could be loving me again
That's what kept me on her tail chasing after all the time
She really was poison, but I guess it was good poison
Look at me here I go again, hoping for another dose of that sweet poison she had, man
Did you ever have a woman like that

[Rambler]
Yeah, I guess I have

[Fisherman]
You know what I mean

[Rambler]
My woman's a lady

[Fisherman]
A lady

[Verse 4] [Rambler]
A lady will give you the best loving you ever had
I don't care what you had in California but even a lady's love can burn out though
But what I mean is a good woman a kind, sweet, considerate, understanding woman
That likes to be treated like she treats you
And if that isn't bull, the better she gives love the more she wants to give
I know what I'm talking about, a lady
Loving's better is a loving heart's going to give another and a lady loves to give

Told me Hulk Hogan only existed on television (what?)
The Stone Cold Stunner and the Leg Drop, all scripted?
N.W.O. and X-Pac? Dang
I used to walk up to them automatic doors
My momma told me that my finger was the power source
So I pointed with my pointer, then, pow! It was open, then come to find out she was jokin'
Had to let it soak in, my mind as a boy didn't wanna believe that McGwire or Barry were on the 'roids

It took a little time, now I realize
Now I know better, it's better late than never
Now I know

[Verse 2]
Over the years, you get more accustomed to pain
Used to believe my dad when he'd say he'd come to my games
Even believed my mother was a saint and could do no wrong
And then she sat me down and told me how I was born (shoot)
Mind blown, but now it all makes sense
Why she didn't spazz on me when she caught me havin' sex
I was perplexed but now I get it
I used to think America was finished with racism, how could I miss it?
I'm mad so many people don't get it
Holdin' this list of black names, but now I'm blacklisted?
Got older, it's like it got no different
I found out that these independent artists isn't independent
Cause major labels fund them quietly to keep perception
That's deception in the game
Used to believe I wanted fame, plus my name written in them lights
Now I know it's so much greater cause it's written in the hand of Christ
Then, I, I used to say the radio would play what the people wanted
Now I know they playin' what's payin'
Feelin' jaded, but somehow I still believe in God

428,I Stand Accused (Of Loving You),"[Intro]
Pardon me.  Can I have a word with you for a few minutes?
Sit down, get comfortable
Uhhh, how long have we known each other? About 10 months? Yeah I think its, yeah. You and John are real tight aren’t ya?
Yeah.  Oh is that an engagement ring?
Awww, congratulations
Oh he slipped it on your finger last night huh?
He’s the luckiest man in the world, you know, he should be real proud to have someone like you
Oh yeah, umm, what I wanted to talk to you about is, well, there is something that has been bugging me for about 5 months and I’ve been carrying it around with me and it’s getting heavier and heavier everyday…
And, uh, yeah it’s almost to the boiling point and I have to get it off my chest
Yeah, I’m not trying to be fresh or anything, because I know you're John’s girl, but I just have to tell you this
You see I have a great deal of respect for you…I’m not being, you know, not going left field on you …but dig

You see I’m gonna take you back to my childhood for a minute….We had quite a big family and we weren’t very rich, sometimes we lived from day-to-day
But one thing we did do was go to church every Sunday.  Mama took us to church, and I was in the choir too, hey yeah I sang a little bit in Sunday school
She taught us the golden rules, the 10 commandments, and she said, “Son do onto others as you have them do onto you”, she said “Don’t steal” “Don’t rob” You know all the things good parents try to instil into their children
Well you know I did a few little things like shoot hook, I guess every kid shoots hooky at least once
And umm, she said “Stay out of trouble” You know when I was a teenager I didn’t break in, burglarize, or rob anybody
I tried to work for what I got, you know, tried to be honest.  Didn’t commit no crimes or nothing, but you know I had to wait,  huh ’til I reached manhood to commit a crime, according to the court of love, if there is such a court
But you know….sometimes you’re forced into things like this, see sometimes Cupid can shoot his arrow so fast you can’t get out the way, you know?
And you can fall and the more you, it’s like being in quicksand too, the more you wiggle the deeper you sink

I’m not gonna take up too much of your time, you see I’m not very good with words and I had to tell you all of that, so I can really say what I got to say
See there is a lot of talk going around town that I’m on the make for John’s girl, “Ike’s on the make for John’s girl”.  I don’t mean to do anybody wrong because I wouldn’t want anybody to bother anything that belongs to me
But you see I’ve never seen anybody like you, I’ve never known anybody like you, and there’s some things you just can’t help.  At night I toss and turn, I try to keep it out my mind but you see….I find myself thinking about you
I just can’t help it, and right now……

I stand accused
Of lovin' you too much
And I hope, I hope it's not a crime
'Cause if it is, I'm guilty
Of lovin' you, you, you

I, I hope to God
That I never have, oh, to testify
'Cause if I do
Everyone is gonna, they're gonna cry
They're gonna say
Old Ike is guilty
Of lovin' a sweet girl like you

I know, I know
You belong to another
I, I may not stand a ghost of a chance
I'll stand on top of Mount Everest
And proudly tell the world that I love ya
Oh yes, I will

Because I, I just can't
I can't help myself
I'm a victim of circumstance

And just one
Ooh, one touch of your hand
I don't know how it happened
But just look at me
I find myself chillin'
On the witness stand

And I'm shoutin' out
All over, all over the land
Everybody, I'm guilty
I'm guilty of lovin', lovin' you

I'm guilty of lovin' you
I said, I'm guilty
But what can I do?
I wanna hold ya
I wanna squeeze ya tight
But my mind said
She belong to another

I am the ghost who come and go
And I hope I'll catch you in the throes
One last look at the wonder
One last look at the wonder

Oh, God, I love you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else we come to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be

You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
I'm hoping that I'll catch you in the throes
One last look at the joy that we've become
But there's no easy answer
None to blame or forgive
We were two cripples dancing
To the bitter end we live

I'm not with you, but of you
I'm not with you, but of you

Oh, God, I loved you
And all of the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be

We had a birthplace in common
We have separate beds and lives
Just sit here and gloat
Break out the oldest pictures
And hang your ruined letters out to dry
We had a birthplace in common
And separate beds and lives

I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
Yeah, oh",Jeff Buckley,1967,[93],1
431,7 Rooms Of Gloom,"[Chorus]
(Seven rooms) I see a house
A house of stone
(Filled with gloom) A lonely house
'Cause now you've gone
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness

[Verse 1]
You took the dream I had for us
Turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that never rings
I watch a door that never rings
Bring you back into my life
Turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house
Turn this house to a home

[Pre-Chorus]
I need your touch to comfort me
Your tender, tender arms that once held me

[Chorus]
(Seven rooms) Without your love
Your love inside
(Filled with gloom) This house is just a place
To run and hide
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) Rooms of emptiness
Without your tenderness

[Verse 2]
Don't make me live from day to day
Watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way
Another reason for me to stay
I need you here, here with me
I need you, darling, desperately
I'm all alone, all alone
In this house that's not a home

[Pre-Chorus]
I miss your love I once had known
I miss your kiss that was my very, very own

[Chorus]
(Seven rooms) Empty silence
Surrounding me
(Filled with gloom) Lonely walls
They stare at me
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness

[Post-Chorus]
All the windows are painted black
And wait right here till you come back
I'll keep waiting, waiting
Till your face again I see

I remember Sunday morning
I would meet her at the park
We'd walk together hand in hand
Till it was almost dark
Now I wake up Sunday morning
Walk across the way to find
Nobody waiting for me
Sunday's just another day

Sunday will never be the same

Sunny afternoons (Sha la la)
That make me feel so warm inside (Sha la la)
Have turned as cold and gray as ashes (Sha la la)
As I feel the embers die
No longer can I walk these paths (Sha la la)
For they have changed (Sha la la)
I must be home, the sun is gone (Sha la la)

434,Do It Again A Little Bit Slower,"Haven't we both heard enough babe
This is what we're gonna do
Let me put my arms around you once more
There's nothing left here to prove

Walk away just a little bit slower
Better hold on tight, will we ever learn to let it go
Break Through to the other side
I keep wondering
When were you ever gonna let me know
That you just wanted something else in life

What do you say when it's all over
What do you know when nothing's going right
The troubles in your mind
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do you go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

It was so hard when I watched you falling down
But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on

Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side
For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone else
And I'll be by your side

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

When it all becomes reality
That this is where it ends for you and me
I'm about to lose my mind
Will love find a way on time
Please don't try and kiss these tears away
We know we've both have made mistakes
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone

So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)

But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)

Used to spit rhymes
On the corner of linden and 199

After a lively summer time
Play the crib
Besides the grind
Puffin lime
Ducking crime
Put away ya sneakers
And the white bimmers
Cause they hard to keep cleaner
Goose fresh out the cleaners
Keep the heat in the v
Walk wit misdemeanors
For the hoodied up schemers
Don't be fooled
Skullies make them look meaner

Bring the drops out

Yeah, often I'm caught up in confusion, in need of dissolution
They tell me the solution to see through this illusion I'm living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mamas tried to warn us, but few tend to listen
See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gena face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
That's the reason why my niggas can't find me, good golly
Look, shawty, ain't no need for games
I know a nigga still young, but I don' seen some things
If it's cool to talk, let me ease your pain
This is food for thought, let me feed your brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?

To try and pimp the system that's a form of prostitution, I'm ready
The city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
Singing the Devil's song in a repetitive medley, I know
But shorty fire and she admire that I'm a pyro
Maniac, I said ""Where you at, and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best.""
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then ""ding ding,"" the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard
I'm starting off with that Cuevo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the Dagos
We like to fuck and watch the day go by
Hasta luego, drop the potato
She's hot, what can I say, yo?

Yeah, girl, your mind should apologize to ya
Keep on tellin' all of those crazy lies to ya

Yeah, you lookin' for love, and I'm the one you imagine
With athlete money from just rappin'
My body wrapped in some Valentino, Loro Piana fashion
Sex with passion, romancin', laughin'
Happiness, action, restaurants, relaxin'
They got some good sushi in Aspen, that good pussy I'm smashin'
I call you Matsuhisa, yeah, I'm your Visa
American Express, I must confess
I'm tryna go beyond love and this is hard to translate
Love is good, but to me, good is just the enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top, but you don't got what it take
To be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star, you was my sister
You was my soldier, damn, I used to miss ya, uh
I used to love ya, I fiend to hold ya
You didn't know me, it was only just a mirage

I got my man/girl

Now go on with your bad self

Oh my my my baby's got that spell on me
Oh now mercy, mercy on me

When you wear those big earrings
Long hair, and things
You got style, girl, that sure is wild
And you wear that cute trench coat
And you're standin' and posin'

A style made up to capture all she needs

Everything in sight

Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye

Run by, don't turn back

456,Don't Rock The Boat,"Я так привык улыбаться на людях
Улыбаюсь, даже когда для улыбки нет повода
Придурки считают, что я - придурок
А я за ней просто прячусь от холода
Этого города и других этих ёбаных городов (м-м-м)
Я не жду повода, с рождения я к этому дерьму уже был готов
Безумие и отвага; в обе ноздри и сверху бумага
Чисто ради угара, чтоб почувствовать тягу и не видеть эту яму вокруг

Тут каждый третий друг, кто кинет через хуй, не моргнув глазом
Еще вчера он - пассажир, сегодня - тянет без тебя уже твою мазу
И где бы я не был, и с кем бы не ладил (с кем бы не ладил)
Я вижу одно - этот ёбаный стыд - этих жадных мразей (a-a-а)
Братик, скажи мне, как есть, на деле (скажи)
Мы тут просто летаем, закинув жопу в Мерс или бьем по мишени, (нет, нет, нет)
Нет, так нет, да и похуй вообще, и так нормально стелим (как надо, как надо)
Есть разговор, так и он не о чём, если он не за деньги

Нам нужно больше, намного больше, чем было вчера
Ведь всё, что есть - это небо над головой и под ногами Москва
Что ты знаешь за жизнь? Оставь при себе!

В бокале - плавно тающий лайм
Городской камуфляж, зима на зубах
В отражении - кайф
Не верь, не бойся, не проси, не занимай
Шевелись или подохни, keep it real (get high)
Твои проблемы - только твои проблемы
Либо встал и сделал, либо двинул за МКАД (ох)

Маршрут, навигатор; по городу плавно ползет альбинос-аллигатор
Внутри - на спокойном ребята
Хет трик мимо постов, как будто так и надо (так и надо)
Не из тех, кто хитрит, всех тех кто хитрит - в топку
Их ждет долгий трип
Так хочется жить, но эта быстрая жизнь так похожа на гонку (у-у)
Кто-то по любому слетит и за ним не один его кореш вдогонку
Тут все очень просто - если хочешь жить - живи
Не раскачивай лодку

And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire just a-gettin' higher in L.A.,
You know where that's at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass

Zal he said, ""Denny, you know there aren't many
Who can sing a song the way that you do; let's go south.""

Called John and Zal and that was the Mugwumps.
McGuinn and McGuire couldn't get no higher
But that's what they were aimin' at

Don't you work as hard as you play
Make up, break up, everything is shake up;
Guess it had to be that way

Michelle, John, and Denny gettin' very tuneful

You know where that's at
And everybody's gettin' fat except Mama Cass.

Broke, busted, disgusted, agents can't be trusted
And Mitchy wants to go to the sea.
Cass can't make it; she says we'll have to fake it---
We knew she'd come eventually

461,Shake,"[JACQUES]
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

463,Funny Familiar Forgotten Feelings,"Last night, quietly, she walked through my mind
As I lay searching for sleep
Her soft hands reached out, she whispered my name
As she brushed a tear from my cheek

And then those funny familiar forgotten feelings
Start walking all over my mind

It's sad, so sad to watch love go by
But a true love would not have gone wrong
I'm just thankful for the good times we've had
For without them I could not go on

With all those funny familiar forgotten feelings
Walking all over my mind

I must go on, be strong
Though millions of teardrops may fall

Before those funny familiar forgotten feelings
Stop walking all over my mind
Before those funny familiar forgotten feelings
Stop walking all over my mind

Before those funny familiar forgotten feelings
Stop walking all over my mind",Pat Kelly,1967,"[54, 49, 55, 57, 70, 77]",6

468,The Jokers,"Baby, we're the jokers
Livin' for fun in the glare of the sun
Though were out of focus
It's easy to see that we're happy to be as we are

We're laughin' all the time
And laughin's not a crime
So while we're in the prime of our lives
Every day's a pantomime

Tell 'em we're the jokers
Isn't it sad when the people get mad
Tryin' to provoke us
To follow the rules of society fools?

And they say it's time to make amends
On you the world depends
Ignore it all, my friends
While you can burn the candle at both ends

All too soon the time will come
For us to own up that we've grown up
So let's go wild and beat the drum
And have our fun while we are young

Baby, we're the jokers
Wearin' the crowns as the king of the clowns
Everywhere we go 'cause
We're livin' for fun and chasin' the sun

'Cause we know that once they leave the pack
The jokers can't go back
They've stepped across the track
And their place will be taken by the jack

Pulling ducks out of the water, got the highest score

All right
I've been thumbing rides travelling light
Walking the streets till past midnight
Tramping roads, trails and lanes
Scaling cliffs fields and plains
Searching till the early dawn
For that long legged girl with the short dress on
Riding trucks, bikes and skis
Sailing lakes and brooks and seas
Driving wagons, cars and jeeps
Walking stilts in ten foot leaps
Searching till the early dawn

[Chorus]
For that long legged girl with the short dress on
And everywhere I go she's been and gone
She's fine, it's just too bad she's the travelling kind
So fine, I just can't rest till I make her mine
I've been from Maine to Tennessee, Mexico and Waikiki
Rain or shine, sleet or snow
Searching high, searching low
Everything depends upon

Thinking how times just fly away
How did everything get so sideways?

Or maybe a night back in high school

So give me a place, just let me know
And I'll take you there, where do you wanna go?

Run from the rays the sun goes black
Melt in the shade the meadows crack
Can't bear the weight up on my back
I hide my face from the attack

Theyre here and I can't stop shaking
Fear, quickly overtakes me

Panic grips my nerves the sound of sirens can be heard
I'm, doomed to a cold dark room I can hear them shuffle
Through the attic, automatic will not save me this time
I can't seem to calm my mind
As they peer through the windows
Red lights shining
Hold my breath
Heart rate still climbing
Wait for death
I grip my chest
They found the steps

Where are you at GOD
What have we done, to deserve this
Run, from the serpents

Still I feel the heat from their
Machines seep through the walls
I hear them creeping through the halls
The door shakes, Lock breaks

Run from the rays the sun goes black
Melt in the shade the meadows crack
Can't bear the weight up on my back
I hide my face from the attack

I run and I run
Under a sun thats no longer familiar
I don't feel safe
I'll just drown in the lake

That I have come to
Nowhere to run to
I cannot undo

All of this HELL
RING THE BELL
I am defeated I BOW TO THEIR FEET

Prey to the beast
That I cannot beat
That I cannot beat
That I cannot BEAT",Jake Hill,1967,"[77, 77]",2

Someone you can't rely on

How you think I felt when you
You left me then
You never said a word except that we're thru'
And you didn't fight it all the way
I don't care
You just don't mean that much to me this way

And do you wanna ride like a crusader?
You ain't gotta Christian Dior (christ endour)

But I'm positive that I'm too deep
Switch the light on when we hit the sheets
Truly what I see is all I keep
I see you stacked chicks their views are blocked in
When I help 'em you say broke in
I see you locked in you say I don't let you in
How come all this drama's still trending

Bring your homie with transparency

But I'm positive the dark ain't deep
Just switch your light on when we hit the streets

My sights are set in higher times
And my eyes can see in 3D
Make it bright and I see 360
I can get you, but you can't get me

485,I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman,"Pata nahi kahan se main shuru karu
I really don’t know how to say
Jan mein shuru kiya tha now it’s may
I wish main woh time laa paun
Jab pehli baar likha tha maine apni maa par essay

I just want to tell you ke tere bina main kuch bhi nahi hu maa
Happy mother’s day
Aisa nahi hai ke main tere baare mein sochta nahi hu
Aur nahi aati mujhe teri yaad



Par kya karu double hogaya hai kamkaaj
I know i always took you for granted
Aur beasar hogaye muhpe tere daat
But you have no clue what i feel for you
Ye batane ki thodi si koshish karunga bas main aaj

I miss you maa
Aur har takleef mein lagta hai kaash tu yaha pe hoti
Jaise bachpan mein manati thi
I wish tu wapis le leti godi

Kaise na school jaane ke liye mere baal banati thi
Aur didi ki choti
Aur humein force karti thi wohi boring vegetable khana
Karela aur roti

Abhi tak main aur didi ladte hain
Kis se zayda karti hai mummy pyar
Apne looks ke baare mein tujhe kuch bhi puchna bekar
Kyunki main kitna bhi bura lagun tu bas yehi kehti hai
That my son is a superstar

Tu kitchen ki ek jinny hai aur bas puri karti rahi humari wish
Humesha thanda khati rahi aur hum sabka bacha unfinished
Bina kiye choo, in fever and flu
Bas baitha ke khilati rahi tu

By the way kabhi pucha nahi maa maine tujhse
What’s your favorite dish?
Tune hamesha mujhe apne se zayda pyar kiya hai
Aur maine hamesha kiya hai tujhe tang
Kabhi lagta hai you don’t love more than your warni and bartan



Gazab ke hain kitchen mein tere saare stunt
Aur jagah jagah pe your hands are burn
Tujh mein superman aur spiderman se zayda shakti hai maa
You’re the ultimate superwoman

Main apne dost ke baare mein sochta hoon
He used to pray day and night
Aur maine notice kiya hai he used to cry
Bichate bichate namaz ke liye chatayi

Fir ek din pucha main uss se
Kya zaroorat hai bhai itna takleef lene ki
Woh bola bhai main actually khud ke liye dua mangta hoon
Kyunki mere paas maa nahi hai to pray for me
Then i hugged him aur foot foot ke roya hoon

I felt light after that
Aisa laga saara tension, uljhan, frustration
Sab kuch hogayi hai khatam
Laga sapne pure na bhi huye na
Toh mujhe zara sa bhi na hoga gum
Laga i’ve got everything
I’ve got my mom



Piche padi rehti hai ke kar na ye dadi clean
Aur saare sildiye meri maa ne mere expensive fate huye jeans
Kitna bola nahi khana hai i’m trying to be lean
Par rotiyan aana band nahi hoti hain
Kehti hai ghee mein hota hai sabse zayda protein
Sabse favorite match hota hai dekhna
Meri maa vs touch screen
Agar football bhi chal raha hai to bas ek hi sawal hota hai
Ke out to ni hua na sachin

Tere bina adhoore hain maa mere ambition mere sab dream
Akela ladne ki taakat nahi hai mujh mein
Every second i need your blessings
Jo tune kiya woh meri samjh se bahar ka hai
Mujhe actually mein nahi hota yakeen
When was the last time you’ve bought something for yourself
Kab ki thi maa last time shopping?



Kaise na maa main tujhe kutte ki maa billi ki maa bolke
Bhaag jaaya karta tha
Yaad hai maa woh din
Aur mujhse pareshan hoke tu kya karti thi marne ki acting

Yeh khoon ka zaroor rishta hai
Par usse thoda zayda thick sa hai
Bade se bade darr maa tere saamne kaha tikta hai
Isiliye toh ek bajhde ki maa apne bache ke sher se bhi lad leti hai
Ek jaanwar ka bacha bhi drane par apni maa ke piche hi jakar chipta hai

I don’t how you do all these things
Ye sab lagta mujhe magic trick sa hai
Ye relation, sacrifice, pain, sweat
Aur aansoon’on se bane bricks ka hai
You’re the prettiest maa
Tere saamne kahan kareena kahan katrina kahan deepika hai
Mujhe bhot acha lagta hai
Jab koi bolta hai bhai tu ekdum tere maa jaisa dikhta hai

I know tu kayi baar soyi hai humein khila ke bhukhe pet
Aur paise bacha bhacha kar humein kapde dilaye hain
Aur birthday mein cakes
Itni aadat hai ki restaurant mein bhi lene lagti hai
Khane ke baad humare plate
Tere saamne saare rishte fike lagte hain maa
Sab ke sab lagte hain fake



Jo ban pada tune woh sab kiya
Na jaane kitne jalaye hain mere liye diye aur mombattiyan
Bina liye raaton ko jhapkiyan
Tune pattiyan laga kar bukhar mein sulaya hai mujhe dekar japhiyan
You gave me values, talents, strength

Ye jadoo maa tune kab kiya?
Shayad possible nahi tha upar wale ka har jagah hona
Isiliye usne yujhe dedi apni saari shaktiyan

I’m sorry maa
Ke bhool jaata hoon tujhe wapis karna phone
I’m sorry kabhi kabhi rude hojata hai mere baat karne ka tone
I’m sorry ke is baar wapis na paaya ghar mein holi pe
Aur jhooth bola ke mujhe chuthi nahi mili office se
I’m sorry maa ke main wahan nahi hoon when you need me
I’m sorry ke akele chadni padti tujhe ghar ki lambi seedi
I’m sorry ke khud lagana padta hai tujhe apne pairon pe tel
I’m sorry ke main wapis bhool gaya wish karna tujhe tere janamdin pe
I’m sorry ke tujhse zayda important ho jaate hain mere dream aur ambition
I’m sorry ke shayad nahi ban paa raha hoon
Main tera woh perfect son



Kya tu dame ki dawai time par khati hai maa?
Ghutno pe dard tha na
Kya dhang se chal paati hai maa?
Main bolne ki bhot koshish karta hoon
Par pata nahi kyu ruk jaata hoon main
Ke mujhe bhot zayda teri yaad aati hai maa

Uss din se main darta hoon jab nahi lagega tera phone
Aur automated awaz bolegi
The person you’re trying is gone
Ye darr mujhe hamesha satata hai maa
I’m scared of being alone
You’re the reason i’m alive
Maa tere bina mera hai kaun?

Main janta hoon ye sab maine pehle bola nahi hai
That’s little overwhelming for you
Lekin bhot dino se mujhe yeh bona tha
Bhot samay se tha ye sab due
Ke tu hasti rahe healthy rahe khush rahe
Uparwale se main yehi karta hoon prey

And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

All the memories I shared with you . .

But somehow when I try to leave you
I just can't go
I love you so
If there could be a holiday for clowns (there should be a holiday)
I would lead the big parade downtown (I would the big parade)
And see you standing there
And tell myself that I don't care
But we both know that that's not true
Tomorrow I'll be back lovin' you

Du schmeißt dein Geld in Novolines, hängst bei Spielos ab

Im Arm 'ne Size-Zero-Slut, Cash on mass, denn gestern Nacht
Räumten wir im Bank Tower drei Mio's ab
Yeah, die Platinrolex blitzt, der Armanismoking sitzt
Wie ich mit paar Asiaten und 'ner Partyhoe am Tisch
Der Bankier mischt das Kartendeck, ich schnips' den Chip zur Mitte
Und seh' 'nen auf Mandarin fluchenden Triadenchef
Der Typ ist hart entsetzt, weil er ständig nur verliert
Er hätte gern mein Blatt wie ein englischer Vampir
Ich schieb' seine Chips zu mir, schieb' sie zur Seite
Im Blick des Securitys hinter der verspiegelten Scheibe
Ich werd' von jedem grad gemustert, denn ich räum' Gewinne ein
Wie deine Mum, nachdem sie meinen Trophäenschrank geputzt hat
Der größte Gewinn, den die Casinobank je sah
Doch ich spiel' mit faulen Tricks, was der Casinobankier sah
Er ruft den Sicherheitsdienst und es kommen Schlägertypen
Breitgebaut und mega wütend, ich steh' auf und nehm' paar Stühle
Werf' sie ihnen entgegen, sie stürmen auf mich zu
Um in die Knie zu gehen nach gezielteren Schlägen
Und ich sprinte nach draußen, da blitzt schon das Blaulicht
Unbemerkt kippt mein Girl sich die Chips in den Ausschnitt
Und spaziert damit raus, wir treffen uns zum Frühstück im Diner
Und lesen die Schlagzeile ""Casino beklaut""

Was on a street that a
Happened to be one of the dead-end streets
Where there was nothing to block
The wind, the elements
Nothing to buffer them for me to
Keep them from knocking my pad down, you know
I mean really socking it to me
When the boiler would bust and the heat was gone
I would have to get fully dressed before I could go the bed
Cause I couldn't put on my goulashes cause they had buckles on them
And my folks didn't play that
They said ""don't you tear up my bed clothes with some goulashes on""
But I was fortunate
As soon as I was big enough to get a job save enough money
To get a ticket to catch anything
I split
I said one day I'm going to return
And I'm going to straighten it all out
And I'm about ready to go back now
So I thought I'd tell ya about it

But I live in the poorest part

The only way I could get along
But when you're raised on a dead-end street
You've got to be tough and strong
Now all the guys I know are getting in trouble
That's how its always been
When the odds are all against you
How can you win, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm going to push my way out of here
Even though I can't say when
But I'm going to get off of this dead-end street
And I ain't never going to come back again

514,Nothing Takes The Place Of You,"I moved your pictures, from my walls
And I replaced them, both large and small
And each new day, finds me so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you

I read your letters, one by one
And I still love you, when it's all said and done
And oh, my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you

As I, as I write this letter
It's raining, it's raining on my window pane
And, and I feel the need of you
You see, without you, nothing seems the same

So I'll wait, I'll wait until you're home
Again I love you, but right now I'm all alone
And oh my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you

Nothing can take the place, of your warm smile
Nothing can take the place, of the look in your eyes
Nothing can take the place, of your soft and tender touch
Nothing can take the place, of you, oh I miss you so much
Nothing can take the place, of your arms around me",Isaac Hayes,1967,"[71, 63, 52, 52, 58, 59, 64, 74, 85, 85, 100]",11

How could they? I knew they sat there
And called true love a crime (this is what killed me)

I felt so sorry for you
You know why? Because in my heart I knew, oh yes, baby I knew
That they would find you guilty too

Judge, your honor and to the jury
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are innocent
And true love is not a crime

Ever think that it would hit or even move the immovable object without a job?
I'm shy to put it out there like Timmy Turner in Nickelodeon, Sandy and Spongebob
Www.I fall in love too fast.com look it up on real Google chrome
I had to put it in the notes cuz the coats wasn't cold enough to put on the boats thats rockin' in my dome
Just keep crushin on my crush cuz it's been a habit for me ever since i was in Kindergarten
Ever since I plucked up those dandylions for my momma and those red roses from that one garden
But that's something you can't buy like her favorite cherry limeade from up the street Sonics
Liked her in elementary, middle, and when I was High schoolin' so this love has been Chronologic

(Verse)
I thought about this hypothetically
And I know it wouldn't happen technically. But baby we needa see things virtually. Cuz this love goes through telepathically
Runnin through my mind, but it's fine, cuz it's just me
Runnin around town, up and down, at the top of the tree. Got my binoculars cuz im tryin to see. Where's the genie, for my wish 3, having u be my lady
Little miss America, so patriotically. Of course I meant that metaphorically. Without like or as like a simile. They the same with differences and similarities. Comparison, you and the very hot sun. Either one I touch ill be totally done. Tryna have some fun with you on the run. I twist and turn in bed cuz u got my life spun

(Chorus)

(Verse)
Now listen to my reminiscin' cuz I never started switchin my feelings or emotions for an arrow or some love potion for some random chick that put my feet in motion
That's choreography, in other words thats dancing, I now got a crush on her, obsessed or in a trance and I don't know what to do but just play along like its a love song. Funny because I'm about to end
This hippity hop, bunny, she's the icing on the Grandmas secret ingredient red velvet cake, yummy in my tummy. I ain't a dummy I just trippin y'all in this stupid thing called love but I love it cuz I'm only Luv Years Old. The titles been told in the song. DreemReecha but you can call me TheStar becuz

532,I'm A Man,"[Produced by Kevin Parker]

[Verse 1]
Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fucking doubt I make, unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman

Out left field, out left field
Love came along, oh

Building dreams that were all left by the way side
And then outta the blue

Sugar and peaches in a paradise land
Good love and sweetness have taken their stand
She made a mountain of love
From a little grain of sand

Your empty handed armies are going home

Has taken all his blankets from the floor

At the time I was born I was not alone
There was my mama, the doctor and the microphone
And as a baby, I didn't cry or whine
I only had time for nursery rhymes
And as a young boy I found time to rock
I would rock any other MC on his block
I didn't care who, one or two
If the sucker came alone or he came with his crew

And when I got there I was ready to rock
But before I got started, I knew it was time
For a bottle of Moet and girl you could be mine
I didn't go far, I went to the bar
It looked like the one I had in my car
I was standing there at the bar
Was a girl who looked like a superstar
She was sweet-a, petite-a, and on my agenda
I knew it was time for her to surrender
Well, we started talking, a little time
Before this girl was saying she was mine
For the moment was gone, I knew it was time
To rock that party with a rhyme on time
See once upon a time before the clock
Somebody made a sundial outta rock
And that's when recording time began
And since then man's been clocking man
But you can't turn back the hands of time
And time you can only go back in your mind
What you did can't be undone
The clock keeps moving got you on the run
So you get yourself a job, you're never late
'Cause you love your hourly pay rate
So you wake up in the morning, brush your teeth and your hair
And then you let the soap hit you everywhere
So you put on your clothes, you're out the door
Racing to beat the clock once more
So you run to the station, the train's on time
You run a little late and now you're heading behind
You need to pay the rent and all your boss has to say
""Don't worry, it's coming out of your pay""
But you can't sit down, you never stop

Someone told me
It's all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe it's true

[Verse 1]
It's a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park;
Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo
But you can take the crosstown bus
If it's raining or it's cold
And the animals will love it
If you do
If you do now

[Bridge]
Something tells me
It's all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe it's true

[Verse 2]
The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum
Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas! You gotta come and see
At the zoo

549,My Back Pages,"[Verse 1]
Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud 'neath heated brow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 2]
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 3]
Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Un-thought of, though, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 4]
A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
“Equality,” I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 5]
In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 6]
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then

Chorus
And with ring I promise you
Everything that I have or can do
There's so many roads that love can run
But here in my heart your the only one

I do all right here on my own
But you give me things I've never known
Oh here I am getting up my nerve
It may not be all that you deserve

551,Love Eyes,"I wake up in the morning and look into the mirror
The same old face is staring back at me
Then I cry  cause I don't seem to get any nearer
To the person I wish I could be

Chorus:
And so I look into your love eyes and you see me
Through your love eyes
And beauty is what you'll see in me
Cause you washed me
With those tears fallen from your love eyes

All that people see is the part of me that's showing
They figure that's the way I'll always be
But you look ahead to the day I'm full grown
And there's nothing but beauty in me

I've heard it said that love is blind
And I know that just ain't true

552,Bernadette,"[Verse 1]
Bernadette, people are searching for
The kind of love that we possess
Some go on searching their whole life through
And never find the love I've found in you

[Chorus 1]
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds
They pretend to be my friend, when all the time
(Sweet Bernadette)
They long to persuade you from my side
(Sweet Bernadette)
They'd give the world and all they own
For just one moment we have known

[Verse 2]
Bernadette, they want you because
Of the pride that it gives
But Bernadette, I want you because
I need you to live

[Chorus 2]
But while I live only to hold you
Some other men, they long to control you
But how can they control you, Bernadette?
(Sweet Bernadette)
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette?
(Sweet Bernadette)
From wanting you, needing you
But darling, you belong to me

[Bridge]
I'll tell the world, you belong to me
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me
I'll tell the world, you're a part of me
Bernadette

[Verse 3]
In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
The world is searching for
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
Has always been longing for

[Chorus 3]
In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore
That's why I treasure you and place you high above
(Sweet Bernadette)
For the only joy in life is to be loved
(Sweet Bernadette)
So whatever you do, Bernadette
Keep on loving me
Bernadette, keep on needing me
Bernadette

You're the soul of me
More than a dream, you're a plan to me

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow

And when you come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying

And all my grave shall warmer, sweeter be

557,Got To Have You Back,"Got to have you back I need you
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride
Made me break your heart
Now our love has died
I see a closing door - a door never more
A door of jealousy between your love and me
Now I face a storm of tears
You took the sunshine from my face
Now I'm just another man
Who walks the undestined way
Without your guiding hand
I can hardly tell when I'm the man
Pride made a fool of me
Now I'm drowning in misery - misery is drowning me

And I've got to have you back I need you
Between the night and day oh heaven speed you
Cos I need you girl
I've been told - it's a loneliness
Oh dark is the emptiness
Since you've been gone in me
Oh gone is the lover I need
Pride destroyed the love we knew
But not my need for you
Without your love around
My whole world is falling down - falling down - all around
And I've got to have you back

Got to have you back
Got to have you back
Got to have you back
Got to have you back

I see a closing door...

Got to have you back - I'm drowning in misery
Got to have you back - my pride made a fool of me

And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealin'
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feelin'
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

561,Walkin' In The Sunshine,"Look out cause here comes some free advice
Walk in the sunshine, watch for the bright sun
Be all those things you’re able to be
You got to listen to the heavens, you got to try to
Understand
The grateness of their movement is just as small as it
Is grand
Try not to hurry, it’s just not your worry
Leave it to those all caught up in time
You got to deep-six your wristwatch, you got to try and
Understand
The time it seems to capture is just the movement of
Its hands
I ain’t preachin’, ’cause I don’t know
How to make fast things move along slow
I can’t stop it, can’t make it go
Just ’cause I say it, that don’t mean that it’s so, no
No
Watch what you hear now, make sure it’s clear now
Just ’cause it’s said that don’t mean that it’s true
So all we say:
You got to make a revolution, you got to help me with
My cause
You got to burn down all the buildings, you got to
Throw out all the laws
I ain’t burning, Lord, I’m still only learning
How to become a man of my own
Just want to find out what’s right and what’s wrong
I ain’t crazy, all the world keeps on turning
I’m still trying to find out what’s right and what’s
Wrong

Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

564,Dry Your Eyes,"[Verse 1]
In one single moment your whole life can turn around
I stand there for a minute, staring straight into the ground
Looking to the left slightly, then looking back down
The world feels like it's caved in proper, sorry frown
Please let me show you how we could only just be for us
I can change and I can grow, or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship if you must
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me
But her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up, she's looking down at her feet

[Chorus]
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

[Verse 2]
So then I move my hand up from down by my side
Shaking, my life is crashing before my eyes
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh
'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
There's things I can't imagine doing, things I can't imagine seeing
It weren't suppose to be easy, surely
Please, please, I beg you, please
She brings her hand up towards where my hands rested
She wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed with
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
By pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers

[Chorus]
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

[Interlude]
And I'm just standing there
I can't say a word, 'cause everything's just gone
I've got nothing, absolutely nothing

[Verse 3]
Trying to pull her close out of bare desperation
Put my arms around her, trying to change what she's saying
Pull my head level with hers, so she might engage and
Look into her eyes to make her listen again
I'm not gonna fucking just fucking leave it all now
'Cause you said it'd be forever and that was your vow
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down?
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town
She pulls away my arms that tightly clamp around her waist
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face
Takes one step forward, looks back, and then walks away

[Chorus]
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

[Bridge]
I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Telling you things but not telling straight
But the more I pull on your hand and say
The more you pull away

[Chorus]
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts

565,I Found A Love - Part 1,"POEMS 1876-1889

4
THE WRECK
OF THE DEUTSCHLAND

         To the
happy memory of five Franciscan Nuns
   exiles by the Falk Laws
drowned between midnight and morning of
     Dec. 7th. 1875

PART THE FIRST

1
            Thou mastering me
        God! giver of breath and bread;
   World's strand, sway of the sea;
        Lord of living and dead;
  Thou hast bound bones and veins in me, fastened me flesh,
  And after it almost unmade, what with dread,
    Thy doing: and dost thou touch me afresh?
Over again I feel thy finger and find thee.

2
            I did say yes
        O at lightning and lashed rod;
   Thou heardst me truer than tongue confess
        Thy terror, O Christ, O God;
  Thou knowest the walls, altar and hour and night:
  The swoon of a heart that the sweep and the hurl of thee trod
    Hard down with a horror of height:
And the midriff astrain with leaning of, laced with fire of stress.

3
            The frown of his face
        Before me, the hurtle of hell
   Behind, where, where was a, where was a place?
        I whirled out wings that spell
  And fled with a fling of the heart to the heart of the Host.
  My heart, but you were dovewinged, I can tell,
    Carrier-witted, I am bold to boast,
To flash from the flame to the flame then, tower from the grace
    to the grace.

4
            I am soft sift
        In an hourglass—at the wall
   Fast, but mined with a motion, a drift,
        And it crowds and it combs to the fall;
  I steady as a water in a well, to a poise, to a pane,
  But roped with, always, all the way down from the tall
    Fells or flanks of the voel, a vein
Of the gospel proffer, a pressure, a principle, Christ's gift.

5
            I kiss my hand
        To the stars, lovely-asunder
   Starlight, wafting him out of it; and
        Glow, glory in thunder;
  Kiss my hand to the dappled-with-damson west:
  Since, tho' he is under the world's splendour and wonder,
    His mystery must be instressed, stressed;
For I greet him the days I meet him, and bless when I understand.

6
            Not out of his bliss
        Springs the stress felt
   Nor first from heaven (and few know this)
        Swings the stroke dealt—
  Stroke and a stress that stars and storms deliver,
  That guilt is hushed by, hearts are flushed by and melt—
    But it rides time like riding a river
(And here the faithful waver, the faithless fable and miss),

7
            It dates from day
        Of his going in Galilee;
   Warm-laid grave of a womb-life grey;
        Manger, maiden's knee;
  The dense and the driven Passion, and frightful sweat;
  Thence the discharge of it, there its swelling to be,
    Though felt before, though in high flood yet—
What none would have known of it, only the heart, being hard at bay,

8
            Is out with it! Oh,
        We lash with the best or worst
   Word last! How a lush-kept plush-capped sloe
        Will, mouthed to flesh-burst,
  Gush!—flush the man, the being with it, sour or sweet,
  Brim, in a flash, full!—Hither then, last or first,
    To hero of Calvary, Christ,'s feet—
Never ask if meaning it, wanting it, warned of it—men go.

9
            Be adored among men,
        God, three-numberèd form;
    Wring thy rebel, dogged in den,
        Man's malice, with wrecking and storm.
  Beyond saying sweet, past telling of tongue,
  Thou art lightning and love, I found it, a winter and warm;
    Father and fondler of heart thou hast wrung:
Hast thy dark descending and most art merciful then.

10
            With an anvil-ding
        And with fire in him forge thy will
   Or rather, rather then, stealing as Spring
        Through him, melt him but master him still:
  Whether at once, as once at a crash Paul,
  Or as Austin, a lingering-out sweet skill,
    Make mércy in all of us, out of us all
Mastery, but be adored, but be adored King.

PART THE SECOND

11
            'Some find me a sword; some
         The flange and the rail; flame,
   Fang, or flood' goes Death on drum,
        And storms bugle his fame.
  But wé dream we are rooted in earth—Dust!
  Flesh falls within sight of us, we, though our flower the same,
    Wave with the meadow, forget that there must
The sour scythe cringe, and the blear share come.

12
            On Saturday sailed from Bremen,
        American-outward-bound,
   Take settler and seamen, tell men with women,
        Two hundred souls in the round—
  O Father, not under thy feathers nor ever as guessing
  The goal was a shoal, of a fourth the doom to be drowned;
    Yet did the dark side of the bay of thy blessing
Not vault them, the million of rounds of thy mercy not reeve
    even them in?

13
            Into the snows she sweeps,
        Hurling the haven behind,
   The Deutschland, on Sunday; and so the sky keeps,
        For the infinite air is unkind,
  And the sea flint-flake, black-backed in the regular blow,
  Sitting Eastnortheast, in cursed quarter, the wind;
    Wiry and white-fiery and whirlwind-swivellèd snow
Spins to the widow-making unchilding unfathering deeps.

14
            She drove in the dark to leeward,
        She struck—not a reef or a rock
   But the combs of a smother of sand: night drew her
        Dead to the Kentish Knock;
  And she beat the bank down with her bows and the ride of
   her keel:
  The breakers rolled on her beam with ruinous shock;
    And canvas and compass, the whorl and the wheel
Idle for ever to waft her or wind her with, these she endured.

15
            Hope had grown grey hairs,
        Hope had mourning on,
   Trenched with tears, carved with cares,
        Hope was twelve hours gone;
  And frightful a nightfall folded rueful a day
  Nor rescue, only rocket and lightship, shone,
    And lives at last were washing away:
To the shrouds they took,—they shook in the hurling and
    horrible airs.

16
            One stirred from the rigging to save
        The wild woman-kind below,
   With a rope's end round the man, handy and brave—
        He was pitched to his death at a blow,
  For all his dreadnought breast and braids of thew:
  They could tell him for hours, dandled the to and fro
    Through the cobbled foam-fleece, what could he do
With the burl of the fountains of air, buck and the flood of the wave?

17
            They fought with God's cold—
        And they could not and fell to the deck
   (Crushed them) or water (and drowned them) or rolled
        With the sea-romp over the wreck.
  Night roared, with the heart-break hearing a heart-broke rabble,
  The woman's wailing, the crying of child without check—
    Till a lioness arose breasting the babble,
A prophetess towered in the tumult, a virginal tongue told.

18
            Ah, touched in your bower of bone
        Are you! turned for an exquisite smart,
   Have you! make words break from me here all alone,
        Do you!—mother of being in me, heart.
  O unteachably after evil, but uttering truth,
  Why, tears! is it? tears; such a melting, a madrigal start!
    Never-eldering revel and river of youth,
What can it be, this glee? the good you have there of your own?

19
            Sister, a sister calling
        A master, her master and mine!—
   And the inboard seas run swirling and bawling;
        The rash smart sloggering brine
  Blinds her; but she that weather sees one thing, one;
  Has one fetch in her: she rears herself to divine
    Ears, and the call of the tall nun
To the men in the tops and the tackle rode over the storm's brawling.

20
            She was first of a five and came
        Of a coifèd sisterhood.
   (O Deutschland, double a desperate name!
        O world wide of its good!
  But Gertrude, lily, and Luther, are two of a town,
  Christ's lily and beast of the waste wood:
    From life's dawn it is drawn down,
Abel is Cain's brother and breasts they have sucked the same.)

21
            Loathed for a love men knew in them,
        Banned by the land of their birth,
   Rhine refused them. Thames would ruin them;
        Surf, snow, river and earth
  Gnashed: but thou art above, thou Orion of light;
  Thy unchancelling poising palms were weighing the worth,
    Thou martyr-master: in thy sight
Storm flakes were scroll-leaved flowers, lily showers—sweet
    heaven was astrew in them.

22
            Five! the finding and sake
        And cipher of suffering Christ.
   Mark, the mark is of man's make
        And the word of it Sacrificed.
  But he scores it in scarlet himself on his own bespoken,
  Before-time-taken, dearest prizèd and priced—
    Stigma, signal, cinquefoil token
For lettering of the lamb's fleece, ruddying of the rose-flake.

23
            Joy fall to thee, father Francis,
        Drawn to the Life that died;
   With the gnarls of the nails in thee, niche of the lance, his
        Lovescape crucified
  And seal of his seraph-arrival! and these thy daughters
  And five-livèd and leavèd favour and pride,
    Are sisterly sealed in wild waters,
To bathe in his fall-gold mercies, to breathe in his all-fire glances.

24
            Away in the loveable west,
        On a pastoral forehead of Wales,
   I was under a roof here, I was at rest,
        And they the prey of the gales;
  She to the black-about air, to the breaker, the thickly
  Falling flakes, to the throng that catches and quails,
    Was calling 'O Christ, Christ come quickly':
The cross to her she calls Christ to her, christens her wild-worn Best.

25
            The majesty! what did she mean?
        Breathe, arch and original Breath.
   Is it love in her of the being as her lover had been?
        Breathe, body of lovely Death.
  They were else-minded then, altogether, the men
  Woke thee with a we are perishlng in the weather of Gennesareth.
    Or is it that she cried for the crown then,
The keener to come at the comfort for feeling the combating keen?

26
            For how to the heart's cheering
        The down-dogged ground-hugged grey
   Hovers off, the jay-blue heavens appearing
        Of pied and peeled May!
  Blue-beating and hoary-glow height; or night, still higher,
  With belled fire and the moth-soft Milky Way,
    What by your measure is the heaven of desire,
The treasure never eyesight got, nor was ever guessed what for
    the hearing?

27
            No, but it was not these.
        The jading and jar of the cart,
   Time's tasking, it is fathers that asking for ease
        Of the sodden-with-its-sorrowing heart,
  Not danger, electrical horror; then further it finds
  The appealing of the Passion is tenderer in prayer apart:
    Other, I gather, in measure her mind's
Burden, in wind's burly and beat of endragonèd seas.

28
            But how shall I … make me room there;
        Reach me a … Fancy, come faster—
   Strike you the sight of it? look at it loom there,
        Thing that she … there then! the Master,
  Ipse, the only one, Christ, King, Head:
  He was to cure the extremity where he had cast her;
    Do, deal, lord it with living and dead;
Let him ride, her pride, in his triumph, despatch and have done
    with his doom there.

29
            Ah! there was a heart right!
        There was single eye!
   Read the unshapeable shock night
        And knew the who and the why;
  Wording it how but by him that present and past,
  Heaven and earth are word of, worded by?—
    The Simon Peter of a soul! to the blast
Tarpeian-fast, but a blown beacon of light.

30
            Jesu, heart's light,
        Jesu, maid's son,
    What was the feast followed the night
        Thou hadst glory of this nun?
  Feast of the one woman without stain.
  For so conceived, so to conceive thee is done;
    But here was heart-throe, birth of a brain,
Word, that heard and kept thee and uttered thee outright.

31
            Well, she has thee for the pain, for the
        Patience; but pity of the rest of them!
   Heart, go and bleed at a bitterer vein for the
        Comfortless unconfessed of them—
  No not uncomforted: lovely-felicitous Providence
  Finger of a tender of, O of a feathery delicacy, the breast of the
    Maiden could obey so, be a bell to, ring of it, and
Startle the poor sheep back! is the shipwrack then a harvest; does
    tempest carry the grain for thee?

32
            I admire thce, master of the tides,
        Of the Yore-flood, of the year's fall;
   The recurb and the recovery of the gulfs sides,
        The girth of it and the wharf of it and the wall;
  Stanching, quenching ocean of a motionable mind;
  Ground of being, and granite of it: past all
    Grasp God, throned behind
Death with a sovereignty that heeds but hides, bodes but abides;

33
            With a mercy that outrides
        The all of water, an ark
   For the listener; for the lingerer with a love glides
        Lower than death and the dark;
  A vein for the visiting of the past-prayer, pent in prison,
  The-last-breath penitent spirits—the uttermost mark
    Our passion-plungèd giant risen,
The Christ of the Father compassionate, fetched in the storm of
    his strides.

34
            Now burn, new born to the world,
        Doubled-naturèd name,
   The heaven-flung, heart-fleshed, maiden-furled
        Miracle-in-Mary-of-flame,
  Mid-numbered He in three of the thunder-throne!
  Not a dooms-day dazzle in his coming nor dark as he came;
    Kind, but royally reclaiming his own;
A released shower, let flash to the shire, not a lightning of fire
    hard-hurled.

35
            Dame, at our door
        Drowned, and among our shoals,
   Remember us in the roads, the heaven-haven of the
                  Reward:
        Our King back, oh, upon English souls!
  Let him easter in us, be a dayspring to the dimness of us,
   be a crimson-cresseted east,
  More brightening her, rare-dear Britain, as his reign rolls,
   Pride, rose, prince, hero of us, high-priest,
Our hearts' charity's hearth's fire, our thoughts' chivalry's throng's

566,I'll Try Anything,"[Verse 1]
Ten decisions shape your life
You'll be aware of five about
Seven ways to go through school
Either you're noticed or left out
Seven ways to get ahead
Seven reasons to drop out
When I said, ""I can see me in your eyes""
You said, ""I can see you in my pants""
That's not just friendship, that's romance, too
You like music we can dance to

[Chorus]
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you

[Verse 2]
There is a time when we all fail
Some people take it pretty well
Some take it all out on themselves
Some they just take it out on friends
Oh, everybody plays the game
And if you don't you're called insane

[Bridge]
Don't, don't, don't, don't, it's not safe no more
I've got to see you one more time
That’s when you were born
In 1984

[Chorus]
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you

[Verse 3]
Everybody was well dressed
And everybody was a mess
Six things without fail you must do
So that your woman loves just you
Oh, all the girls played mental games
And all the guys were dressed the same

Why not try it all
If you only remember it once?
Oooh ooooooh

[Chorus]
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you",The Strokes,1967,"[54, 40, 40, 50, 53, 63, 72, 90]",8
567,The Lady Came From Baltimore,"[Intro]
The lady came from Baltimore and all she wore was lace
She didn't know that I was poor, she never saw my place

[Chorus]
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none

[Verse]
The lady's name was Susan Moore, her daddy read the law
She didn't know that I was poor, and lived outside the law
Her daddy said I was a thief and didn't marry her for love
But I was Susan's true belief, and I married her for love
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none
The house she lived in had a wall to keep the robbers out
She never stopped to think at all, that that's what I'm about

Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none",Johnny Cash,1967,"[62, 62, 63, 78, 86]",5

569,When Love Slips Away,"From the beginning
You were my life
And through the seasons
I made the sacrifice
Now I remember
What you did to me before
It keeps bringing me down

And the relation
Tore me apart
You were so clever
Girl it broke my heart
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
It keeps spinning around

Darling somehow
Now that you're gone
I have no one
I write you letters
And throw them away
Only a fool keeps hanging on
When love slips away

Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Cause I keep holding on
Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Tell me where I went wrong

Through all the changes
Love was so blind
But I continued
Keeping an open mind
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
I keep spinning around",Bobby Caldwell,1967,[92],1
570,Shake Hands And Walk Away Cryin',"Rumors getting 'round, my sweet baby put me down
Ain't a girl alive with the suffering I feel inside

She's thinking how she'll beat me to the punch but I won't let her

Shake hands and walk away

Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna shake hands and walk away

I'll never say to you, breaking up is hard to do
'Cause I've got my pride, a big man never cries
There's much of life in you and you'd better run too
Knowing it's our last goodbye, it's hard to face you
Don't expect me back for more, I'll just erase you

Shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna shake hands and walk away

And I dreamed about those cottonfields and home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sisters and brothers
And I dreamed about a love who's been waiting there so long

I want to go home
I want to go home
Oh how I want to go home

My kinfolks think I'm big in Detroit city
From all the letters that I write, they think I'm fine
By day I make the cars, but by night I make on the bars
Oh if only they'd just read between the lines

They'd know I want to go home
I want to go home
Oh how I want to go home

You know I rode a freight train north to Detroit city
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
Think I'll put my foolish pride on a southbound train and ride
Head on back to the loved ones I left there waiting there behind

Loser, loser

It's so hard being a loser
Always trying to find a way
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday

And you'll see a lonely man
So all alone, so far from home

And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we

Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo

Played me like a fool, know just how I feel

Well I believed her when she told me
She told me such sweet sweet lovely lies

Wish I could laugh, wish I could cry
Got so tired of living, do not wanna die
But I'll keep on trying
No, I'll never be the same
People say the sun is shining
But I'm still walking in the rain

Just had another woman walk out on me
But I will keep on trying
I'll find my real true love somewhere

Swinging down the street so fancy free
Nobody you meet could ever see the loneliness there

Or is it the clothes you wear

You're always window shopping but
Never stopping to buy
So shed those downy feathers and fly

Hey there Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And oh what a dream may be
The world would be
A new Georgy girl

But there's a reality
You can't always run away

Don't be so scared of changing
And rearranging yourself

Its time for jumping out of your chair

Your flow is so-so, take the L, you so slo'
You know that I'm loco, fans screaming go, go
Girls scream the opposite, I don't love them hoes though
And my exes wanna call but fuck that got new chicks
And they do just like the haters, yeah they come after Lucid
This young cat is ruthless, some tracks were stupid
But hey, go listen to this dumbass's new shit
Come back when you sick, blood baths for you pricks
I'm weilding machetes, you thumbtacks and toothpicks
I'm nearing the heavens, triple 7s, boeing jets
And my forecast always sunny, it ain't never showing threats

I'm that little kid who's balling just dreaming of the pros
Believing I can go that far just speaking shit I know
And achievements finally came when I let those demons go
This here is my moment, I am Caesar screaming no
So let me show you just how being painless feels
Lyrical bullets are untouchable, I spit stainless steel
In a world full of fake shit, I'm remaining real
And as soon as that bass hits I just aim to kill
I am vintage, bitches, my photo's all in black and white
Say hello to the beast like when Captain Jack and the Kraken fight
I will be your tour guide and lead you to the after life
My songs can't be fucked with, this track can be a sacrifice
They're Virgin Islands cause you know they stand alone
And they're all picture perfect, yeah the canvas is their home

Now all that's left are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel

592,What A Woman In Love Won't Do,"He saw her from the bottom of the stairs
Before she saw him. She was starting down
Looking back over her shoulder at some fear
She took a doubtful step and then undid it
To raise herself and look again. He spoke
Advancing toward her: 'What is it you see
From up there always--for I want to know.'
She turned and sank upon her skirts at that
And her face changed from terrified to dull
He said to gain time: 'What is it you see,'
Mounting until she cowered under him
'I will find out now--you must tell me, dear.'
She, in her place, refused him any help
With the least stiffening of her neck and silence
She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see
Blind creature; and awhile he didn't see
But at last he murmured, 'Oh,' and again, 'Oh.'

'What is it--what?' she said
'Just that I see.'

'You don't,' she challenged. 'Tell me what it is.'

'The wonder is I didn't see at once
I never noticed it from here before
I must be wonted to it--that's the reason
The little graveyard where my people are!
So small the window frames the whole of it
Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?
There are three stones of slate and one of marble
Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
On the sidehill. We haven't to mind those
But I understand: it is not the stones
But the child's mound--'

'Don't, don't, don't, don't,' she cried

She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm
That rested on the bannister, and slid downstairs;
And turned on him with such a daunting look
He said twice over before he knew himself:
'Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?'

'Not you! Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't need it!
I must get out of here. I must get air
I don't know rightly whether any man can.'

'Amy! Don't go to someone else this time
Listen to me. I won't come down the stairs.'
He sat and fixed his chin between his fists
'There's something I should like to ask you, dear.'

'You don't know how to ask it.'

'Help me, then.'

Her fingers moved the latch for all reply

'My words are nearly always an offense
I don't know how to speak of anything
So as to please you. But I might be taught
I should suppose. I can't say I see how
A man must partly give up being a man
With women-folk. We could have some arrangement
By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off
Anything special you're a-mind to name
Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that love
Two that don't love can't live together without them
But two that do can't live together with them.'
She moved the latch a little. 'Don't--don't go
Don't carry it to someone else this time
Tell me about it if it's something human
Let me into your grief. I'm not so much
Unlike other folks as your standing there
Apart would make me out. Give me my chance
I do think, though, you overdo it a little
What was it brought you up to think it the thing
To take your mother--loss of a first child
So inconsolably--in the face of love
You'd think his memory might be satisfied--'

'There you go sneering now!'

'I'm not, I'm not!
You make me angry. I'll come down to you
God, what a woman! And it's come to this
A man can't speak of his own child that's dead.'

'You can't because you don't know how to speak
If you had any feelings, you that dug
With your own hand--how could you?--his little grave;
I saw you from that very window there
Making the gravel leap and leap in air
Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly
And roll back down the mound beside the hole
I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you
And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs
To look again, and still your spade kept lifting
Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice
Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why
But I went near to see with my own eyes
You could sit there with the stains on your shoes
Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave
And talk about your everyday concerns
You had stood the spade up against the wall
Outside there in the entry, for I saw it.'

'I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed
I'm cursed. God, if I don't believe I'm cursed.'

'I can repeat the very words you were saying
""Three foggy mornings and one rainy day
Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.""
Think of it, talk like that at such a time!
What had how long it takes a birch to rot
To do with what was in the darkened parlor
You couldn't care! The nearest friends can go
With anyone to death, comes so far short
They might as well not try to go at all
No, from the time when one is sick to death
One is alone, and he dies more alone
Friends make pretense of following to the grave
But before one is in it, their minds are turned
And making the best of their way back to life

If I can change it. Oh, I won't, I won't!'

'There, you have said it all and you feel better
You won't go now. You're crying. Close the door
The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up
Amy! There's someone coming down the road!'

Somewhere out of this house. How can I make you--'

I'll follow and bring you back by force. I will!--'",Robert Frost,1967,"[44, 31, 31, 41, 52, 65, 76]",7
593,No Milk Today,"[Verse 1]
No milk today, my love has gone away
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn
No milk today, it seems a common sight
But people passing by, don't know the reason why

[Chorus]
How could they know just what this message means?
The end of my hopes, the end of all my dreams
How could they know a palace there had been
Behind the door where my love reigned as queen?

[Verse 2]
No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we turned night into day

[Bridge]
But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town
Becomes a shrine where I think of you only
Just two up two down

[Verse 3]
No milk today, it wasn't always so
The company was gay, we turned night into day
As music played, the faster did we dance
We felt it both at once, the start of our romance

[Chorus]

No milk today, my love has gone away
The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn

[Bridge]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A terraced house in a mean street back of town

594,The Girl I Knew Somewhere,"You tell me that you've never been this way before
You tell me things I know that I've heard somewhere
You're standing in the places and you're
Staring down through faces, that bring to mind traces
Of a girl, a girl that I knew somewhere

I just can't put my finger on what it is
That says to me ""Watch out! Don't believe her.""
I can't give any reasons girl
My thoughts are bound down in a whirl
I just can't think who in the world was that girl;
I know I met her somewhere

Someway, somehow this same thing was done
Someone, somewhere did me this same wrong

Well, goodbye dear, I just can't take this chance again
My fingers are still burning from the last time
And if your love was not a game, I only have myself to blame
That's as may be, I can't explain

Just ask the girl that I knew somewhere",The Monkees,1967,"[48, 39, 46, 51, 65]",5
595,Tell Me To My Face,"(Clarke/Hicks/Nash)
Will you try to justify the meaning, of the note you sent this evening, to my door your not deceiving me
I'd of thought that you'd have known me better, sending round an unsigned letter, facing you would be much better now
Is it just that you can't face the future with me, can't you tell me to my face
You just took the cowards way to say good-bye, how would you feel here in my place?
If at last I think I'm glad, to rid myself of you I'm sad, to think about the time I let you go
Then I turn and walk away, so please don't beg for me to stay, cause I know just what I
Will say to you
Is it just that you can't face the future with me, can't you tell me to my face
You just took the cowards way to say good-bye, how would you feel here in my place?
Tell me to my face your leaving now
Tell me to my face your leaving now",Keith,1967,"[49, 37, 40, 44, 54, 77]",6
596,Pipe Dream,"(Verse 1: Psiklone
Kick back, grab your roach and Rizla, roll a jigger
Spark it and join me for this motion picture
Hand it to the camera man
I taxi more zoots than cabs and trams and camper-vans in Amsterdam
Spaced out, munching cookies, bunning zoobies
A thick mist creeping out from under hoodies
Drop hot rocks the size of suns
Hit bongs and breathe green smog from fiery lungs
Crashing out like stunt teams, hungry
Raid the fridge for munchies like monkeys from Jumanji
Trippin’ sittin’ down, the room is spinnin’ round
My shrink is now shrunk ’til he’s fizzled out
Exhale nimbus clouds, smoking skunk so I stay fucked
Wake up, roll my tongue and blaze my taste buds
Cold winter daze, numb as ice in a haze
Bedroom window frame on summer nights with your mates
So, why wait for Western medicine?
When I can cope my way
And smoke high grade for chest infections
Mind raising sense perception, I make direct connections
With lives made of recollections
In the lab we get high off chronic blast
And play traffic lights ’til my red eyes are stopping cars
This stoner’s cataclysmic
Roll spliffs so big the smoke rings turn passive smokers paralytic

Sampled:
I got a slight problem, I smoke weed too much...
Lungs hold so much skunk they're like a chest of drawers...
If I do start to smoke weed.....won't breath out for a whole week and OD

I got a slight problem, I smoke weed too much...
We don't give a fuck.... when we smoked out
In the land that's doped out (It's like that?)

[Plazma]
I won’t make the decision to break the addiction
I’ll hit the green ’til I reach a higher plane of existence
THC remains in my system
As long as street hustlers keep smugglin’ grade for a livin’
But chronic’s not for abuse, used to get a confidence boost
But over the years, my tolerance grew
When I’m offered a zoot, I won’t often refuse
Everyone’s “giving up” but nobody follows it through
But I’ll give up some other day, build up another J
My love for skunk just munched my monthly wage
Overfiends roam the streets smoking green
Looked upon us hopeless seeds with broken dreams
Take up drug smugglin’ and fuck tough punishments
Handed out by our unjust government
Both my eyes the color of blood, always buzzing off skunk
Due to London’s abundance of drugs
Mary Jane’s got me under the funk, kept in my home
Enjoys consumin’ my time and spendin’ my dough
Kick back and enter the zone, the Incredible Hulk
That relies on skunk to stunt my skeletal growth
I was heavily stoned sessions ago
But there’s five-man to a zoot, someone ain’t gettin’ a toke (nope!)
It’s the one and only Plazma, provokin’ cancer
Smokin’ ganja just to control my anger

I fell in love with a beautiful nurse

599,Cry To Me,"(Intro)
Sometimes it's so hard to be happy.
When all you do is hold on to your insecurities.
The hurting heart is the most painful.
So let it all out then, oh cry.

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

(Verse 1)
When will you emerge from your hideaway?
From natural feelings that you won't escape.
Maybe it's my mind drifting too far into space.
And fly away to a better place.
But there's no other spot I'd rather lay.
So don't be scared, no, I won't hurt you (so cry).

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

(Bridge)
We're better together in any weather.
If you're cold I'm your sweater.
If it rains I'm your umbrella.
No is one perfect, but to me you're perfection.
What are flaws besides they're creation?
You're gunna walk through the heartaches, walk through the pain.
Don't feel alone in the shadow.
You're not the one to blame.
So if I could just ease your mind to see what you should be or to look and to watch and what to believe is real.
Let it all go, it will make you feel better.
So drop it all and cry to me if you want to.

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
Fine, it's fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside (inside).

600,Girl I Need You,"Chorus:
Girl I need you so
Tell me why my heart feels so low
Girl I want you more
Please don't leave me standing at the door

[Verse 1: ViZion]
On these nights when we fight I go to bed lonely
I'm worrying while wondering if you'll phone me
Wish I wasn't alone, this breeze is blowing coldly
Tell me, why this lonliness surrounds me
Love on the phone line, killing us slowly
Can't kiss the phone and the phone cannot hold me
So much foundation, to act like you don't know me
Girl that's only phony, put your arms around me

Chorus:
Girl I need you so
Tell me why my heart feels so low
Girl I want you more
Please don't leave me standing at the door
Girl I need you so
Tell me why my heart feels so low
Girl I want you more
Please don't leave me standing at the door

[Verse 2: ViZion]
Feeling down and lonely after all of the drama
Will never forget her, she was my nirvana
Teardrops are clear, so I hid behind this armour
Trying to feel better, smoke more marijuana
Sitting, on a corner
Drinking, Johnny Walker
Bottle and body dressed in black like a mourner
She came back, no-one warned her
I think that, must've torn her
I only cried her name when she disappeared around the corner

Chorus:
Girl I need you so
Tell me why my heart feels so low
Girl I want you more
Please don't leave me standing at the door
Girl I need you so
Tell me why my heart feels so low
Girl I want you more
Please don't leave me standing at the door

[Verse 3: ViZion]
Now you say yes it's best that I go
But I don't care what you say I'm standing at the door
I walked from your door once before
Tired and unsure, of what we were fighting for
But girl I learned my love is as secure
As the sun rise on the hills and the rain will pour
Solid as a rock with an iron core
I don't wanna feel that heartburn no more

Chorus:
Girl I need you so
Tell me why my heart feels so low
Girl I want you more
Please don't leave me standing at the door
Girl I need you so
Tell me why my heart feels so low

See 2 of them n***as creeping up from the rear/

Not realizing in a min they be swimming in blood/
Passing the bottle stagnating
1 stop to take a piss the other just kept on moving/
Getting real close to the car he not far now
(POP POP) 2 in the back he went on down/
His man not knowing his man got hit
He start busing out laughing till that ass got hit/
Stepped out the car walk over look at his ass
He screamed out please don't kill me take the cash/
It ain't personal, this is business
He screamed out you kill me who going to take care of my children/

Went to finish the other homie he already dead/

Strapped up with more ammo this is war i feel it/

The hold time i'm thinking how to knock him off/
Bust the nut shorty breeze 9 in the morn
Went back to the hood creep around for John/
Funny think he the first that i met in the town
Showed me around, showed me where n***as get down/
Who""s who thugs and chicks what i'm reminiscing for this n***a gotta get it/

Darlin', I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you

Makes me feel half alive

It was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance

You've beat me to the girl that I always wanted
You thought you had her brother but you still don't own her because I'm not through
And there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride

I know that it's a fact that you sneak behind my back
Smiled in my face and deceived me with your lies, but I'm not through
Oh, there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride

But this is the part that you knew nothing of
She confessed to me that she toyed with your love
You were just a game, that she loved to play
You never had her
She took you for a ride

All of her ecstasy that you had
Was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance

You had her brother, you were my guest
You pawned your broken heart just like all the rest
And now you are through
And there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride

Was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance

If our romance is real

May just turn out to be

Do we really care
Or do we share a fool's imagination?
Nights will hurry by
Then you will know, and so will I

When Spring has had its fling
If you are in my arms
We'll know it's not a spell
We'll know it's real, but time will tell

619,The Return Of The Red Baron,"You remember that baron flying high in the sky
When Snoopy shot him down with a gleam in his eye
But that German had leaped from his blood red plane
Just before it burst into a ball of flame
Snoopy circled back, checked his kill
Saw that bloody Red Baron standing high on a hill
Then he swooped down low, shouted, ""Curse you, Red Baron!""
The German shook his fist. You could hear him swear
Hey, watch out, there, Snoopy. You're really in a mess
You thought you were through with that bloody Red Baron
But it looks like he's not down, yet

Then a cry went up all over the land
The bloody Red Baron would strike again
But, brave, little Snoopy said, ""Never fear.""
As he headed for his plane, all the people cheered
Hey, watch out, little Snoopy. You're really in a mess
You thought you were through with that bloody Red Baron
But it looks like he's not down, yet

Snoopy blazed a trail straight across the sea
Searching in vain for his enemy
Then he found that German trying to fix his plane;
A-sweatin' and a-flustered, about to go insane

Snoopy landed for a pistol duel
The Baron was worried; Snoopy was cool
He fired a shot, missed, started to run
Before Snoopy had a chance to raise his gun
Hey, watch out, Red Baron. Snoopy is on your trail
One of these days, he's gonna make you pay, and you'll go straight to

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you are gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you are gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness
That was waiting there

[Verse 2]
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

[Verse 3]
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you are gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you are gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away

[Verse 4]
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

[Verse 5]
Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I could not keep

[Verse 6]
My heart cries out for your touch
But baby, you are not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

And a telegram from New York""

Now can I come home?""

It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says ""I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

633,Think,"[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh",Frank Ocean,1967,[100],1
634,The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game,"[Verse 1]
Everyday brings change
And the world puts on a new face
Certain things rearrange
And this whole world seems like a new face
Secretly I've been tailing you
Like a fox that preys on a rabbit
I had to get you and so I know
I had to learn your ways and habits

Oyou were the catch that I was after
I looked up and I was in your arms
And I know that I was captured

[Chorus]
What's this whole world coming to
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game

[Verse 3]
I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
Love hit me with a sudden slap
One kiss and then I knew it

Omy plan didn't work out like I thought
I had laid my trap for you
But it seems that I got caught

Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise

You need a pick me up?
I'll be there in twenty-five

I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid

I know better than to call you mine

[Verse 2]
I love it when you talk that nerdy shit
We're in our twenties talking thirties shit
We're making money but we're savin' it
'Cause talking shit is cheap and we talk a lot of it
You won't stay with me, I know
But you can have your way with me 'til you go
And before your kisses turn into bruises, I'm a warning

[Chorus]
Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
'Cause I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid

I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you

I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

648,Walk Tall,"All the kids down the street
They're fucking laughing at me
Cause I'm a MURDERER!
I hear them under their breath
All the neighbors call me Mr. Death

(But I don't give a shit!)

It's taken every ounce of strength
I've got to hold my head up
And face the devil in the mirror every day

It's getting worse, it's getting worse
(it's getting worse), (it's getting worse)
(This fever's overcome my body And my face is dripping wet with the blood of the damned)

Beauty is only skin-deep
So naturally I'd skin the bitch alive
So we can see what's underneath this falsified anatomy
Your perfect teeth, what the perfect disguise

To glorify all the lies and bullshit seeping out the sides
(Let's go!)
I'm begging for a way to wipe the slate clean
But if I'm bound to burn in hell
You're coming with me
You can't fucking save me
So save your fucking breath!

We've got her now boys
There's nowhere left to run
What you call necromancing I call retribution

OH!
HA HA HA HA!

Necromancer take me back to where it all began
How can we hope to save the future without confronting our past?

""To my unborn son, I'll see you in heaven when all has been said and done
And lord above, please forgive my love for he knows not what he has done""

So tell me; where did we go wrong?
And when did the world start to turn?
Seems like these days have been numbered
Etched in our blood and our bones
If we keep fighting each other we'll end up all on our own

Where were you?
When they broke through our defenses and left our family defenseless
Relentlessly in pursuit of our glory and our heart
Let me guess this is the part where you tell everyone it wasn't your fault

Here let me carry that cross for ya
While you bang in the nails!
(You're not gonna get too far
Pretending something you're not
Stay true to who you are
Cause each other's all we've got)

Blah. Blah! BLAH! BLAH!
FUCK THE WORLD!
AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU STAND FOR!
IT MAKES ME FUCKING SICK!
YOU SICK DECEIVING BITCH!
I HOPE YOU FUCKING BURN IN HELL!

LET'S GO!

I'm begging for a way to wipe the slate clean
But if I'm bound to burn in hell, You're coming with me!

Women!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
You're all the fucking same!

God himself in all his glory couldn't hold me back from where I right belong
Buried at my brother's side and screaming till the day I die
""Follow your heart and you can never go wrong""

But I can't watch you walk away
Misbehaving, playing games with another man
Cause I'd rather put you in your grave
Than watch you walk with him hand-in-hand

Now careful baby cause you might get cut
Better tell your man to keep his fucking mouth shut
I don't quite think he knows exactly how the story goes
And if he wants a piece of my heart I'll take a piece of his throat!

I'm going kill you slow
Wanna watch the light leave your eyes
And boy you're walking pretty tall for a man your size
(Ha-ha-ha!)

They told me I was given a gift but this lonely gift is called loneliness
And this heart of gold filled with emptiness Is hopelessly worthless
Cause all I wanna do is help everyone else
But I never quite learned how to help myself
Is it any wonder that I can't help this constant urge to kill?

Cause this fucking rooms become my hell
And these god damn walls keep calling me out
So I'll tear em down till nothing's left
And I'll keep on singing till I'm out of breath

Because even if I didn't have a microphone
Well I'd still be screaming all on my own
And I'll keep singing till the music's gone
Even if it takes all god damn night long!

But as long as I've got your attention
I should probably mention
I've got a few confessions or skeletons in my closet

Y'see I killed a man, just to watch him die
And I killed a woman cause I fantasized
About it every day, in every which way
Would somebody just please come take me away

Cause I'm sick (sick) and I'm only getting worse
Hit her with a bat just to watch her hurt
And as I casually filled up her mouth with dirt
I could hear her say ""I hate you""

Well baby join the fucking club!
Cause if you don't know, I don't give a fuck!

Raise 'em like you just don't need 'em

Raise 'em like you just don't need 'em

You say its the moon or maybe the season

Baby, something's wrong

Lately I don't feel much like talking
Instead of going home I just go out walking
And thinking too much and not longing for your touch
Baby somethings changed
I don't feel the same

Look on yonder misty mountain
See the young monk meditating rhododendron forest
Over dusty years, I ask you
What's it been like being you ?

Through all levels you've been changing
Getting a little bit better, no doubt
The doctor bit was so far out
Looking through crystal spectacles
I can see I had your fun

Doing us paperback reader
Made the teacher suspicious about insanity
Fingers always touching girl

Through all levels you've been changing
Getting a little bit better, no doubt
The doctor bit was so far out
Looking through all kinds of windows
I can see I had your fun
Looking through all kinds of windows
I can see I had your fun

Looking through crystal spectacles
I can see I had your fun
Looking through crystal spectacles
I can see I had your fun

Rebelling against society
Such a tiny speculating whether to be a hip or
Skip along quite merrily

Through all levels you've been changing

Broken down a-just as well-a
Looking through crystal spectacles
Ah, I can see I had your fun

But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stupid, I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
'Cause I'm the winner, no, not a loser
To be an M.C. is what I choose-a
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me

Cause I'm Rob, the last name Base, yeah
And on the mic, I'm known to be the freshest

A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up cause I want you to comprehend
Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert

If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No, oh
Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the back-up
We're not soft, so you better just slack up
Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze

665,You Got To Me,"[Verse 1]
To celebrate undyin' faith
We're gathered here like drifted wrecks
For a late September wedding
October breathin' down our necks
And I knew this town in another time
I knew this town a younger man
With the world in my hip pocket
And a subway token in my hand

[Chorus]
Mmm
You got to me

[Verse 2]
And they got candle light and a reggae band
Champagne by the bucket load
Limos lined up down the curb
To take us where we need to go
And I need to go somewhere I've been
To find the place I lost the trail
Way back then, so long ago
I don't suppose you even know

[Chorus]
You got to me
Brought all this empty down on top of me
You got to me

[Verse 3]
We danced between the snowflakes fallin'
Trippin' on the cobblestones
And the trolley tracks, we had it all then
Christmas break, your roommates gone
We stoked the fire and let it burn
Til the embers glowed in the mornin' light
Trust in the tangle of skin on skin
I've not known quite that feeling since

[Chorus]
You got to me
Brought all this empty down on top of me
I didn't know, but we were not to be
But I know a thing or two now

[Verse 4]
The wedding party's ragin' yet
How the old and desperate misbehave
The limo smells like cocaine sweat
Cheap cologne and aftershave
It's gotta be one of these row house doors
I knew the number long ago
I'll step out on the curb
And tell the driver ""just go on and go""

[Chorus]
You got to me
Brought all this empty down on top of me
I didn't know know, but we were not to be
But I know a thing or two now

Leans his bike against a tree
And he's tired and cold and broke

Standing here just like I am
With my vest unbuttoned and my necktie loose
Impervious to all abuse

Too much to dream
I'm not ready to face the light
I had too much to dream
Last night

The room was empty as I staggered from my bed
I could not bear the image racing through my head
You were so real that I could feel your eagerness
And when you raised your lips for me to kiss

Came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone, gone, gone

Oh, too much to dream
Oh, too much to dream
Too much to dream last night

682,"Green, Green Grass Of Home","[Verse 1: Elvis Presley]
The old hometown looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus:  Elvis Presley]
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
All creatures smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Verse 2:  Elvis Presley]
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus:  Elvis Presley]
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Verse 3:  Elvis Presley]
Then I awake and look around me
Four gray walls surround me
And I realize I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
In the shade of that old oak tree

683,So You Want To Be A Rock 'N' Roll Star,"[Verse 1]
So you want to be a rock 'n' roll star?
Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
Then take some time and learn how to play

And with your hair swung right
And your pants too tight
It's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Then it's time to go downtown
Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
Who are waiting there to sell plasticware

And in a week or two
If you make the charts
The girls'll tear you apart

[Verse 3]
The price you paid for your riches and fame
Was it all a strange game?
You're a little insane

The money, the game and the public acclaim
Don't forget what you are
You're a rock 'n' roll star

687,Keep A Light In The Window Till I Come Home,"— II —

Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.

Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel a bit peckish.

The coals were reddening.

Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.

—Mkgnao!

—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.

The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my head. Prr.

Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.

—Milk for the pussens, he said.

—Mrkgnao! the cat cried.

They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.

—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.

Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.

—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.

She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.

—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.

He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they can't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.

He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.

On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.

He said softly in the bare hall:

—I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.

And when he had heard his voice say it he added:

—You don't want anything for breakfast?

A sleepy soft grunt answered:

—Mn.

No. She didn't want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar. Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for it. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction. Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.

His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback pictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do. The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's high grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip of paper. Quite safe.

On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there. In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come back anyhow.

He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in that light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly's new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.

Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the Freeman leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the north-west.

He approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as position. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.

Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to tell you? What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they'd only be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.

Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O'Rourke.

Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:

—Good day, Mr O'Rourke.

—Good day to you.

—Lovely weather, sir.

—'Tis all that.

Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thin of the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the job, see?

How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint Joseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At their joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.

He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood.

A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and a half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.

The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.

He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter sanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.

The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.

—Now, my miss, he said.

She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.

—Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you, please?

Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the wood.

—Threepence, please.

His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket. Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.

—Thank you, sir. Another time.

A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after an instant. No: better not: another time.

—Good morning, he said, moving away.

—Good morning, sir.

No sign. Gone. What matter?

He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim: planters' company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel and construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.

Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.

He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin's parade. And Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron's basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees. There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn't see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegian captain's. Wonder if I'll meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.



A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.

No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world.

Desolation.

Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of the bed. Must begin again those Sandow's exercises. On the hands down. Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that? Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.

Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.

Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs Marion.

—Poldy!

Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.

—Who are the letters for?

He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.

—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And a letter for you.

He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.

—Do you want the blind up?

Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.

—That do? he asked, turning.

She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.

—She got the things, she said.

He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.

—Hurry up with that tea, she said. I'm parched.

—The kettle is boiling, he said.

But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.

As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:

—Poldy!

—What?

—Scald the teapot.

On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say they won't eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.

Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's seaside girls.

The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown
Derby, smiling. Silly Milly's birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.

O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.
I'd rather have you without a farthing
Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.

Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! All we laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.

He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it? Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.

Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.

—What a time you were! she said.

She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder. The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.

A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.

—Who was the letter from? he asked.

Bold hand. Marion.

—O, Boylan, she said. He's bringing the programme.

—What are you singing?

—La ci darem with J. C. Doyle, she said, and Love's Old Sweet Song.

Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day. Like foul flowerwater.

—Would you like the window open a little?

She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:

—What time is the funeral?

—Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn't see the paper.

Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.

—No: that book.

Other stocking. Her petticoat.

—It must have fell down, she said.

He felt here and there. Voglio e non vorrei. Wonder if she pronounces that right: voglio. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped and lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.

—Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There's a word I wanted to ask you.

She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.

—Met him what? he asked.

—Here, she said. What does that mean?

He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.

—Metempsychosis?

—Yes. Who's he when he's at home?

—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls.

—O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.

He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes. The first night after the charades. Dolphin's Barn. He turned over the smudged pages. Ruby: the Pride of the Ring. Hello. Illustration. Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked. Sheet kindly lent. The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze at Hengler's. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your neck and we'll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so they metamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man's soul after he dies. Dignam's soul...

—Did you finish it? he asked.

—Yes, she said. There's nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?

—Never read it. Do you want another?

—Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock's. Nice name he has.

She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.

Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to Kearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that's the word.

—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.

The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?

The Bath of the Nymph over the bed. Given away with the Easter number of Photo Bits: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.

He turned the pages back.

—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance. What they called nymphs, for example.

Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.

—There's a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?

—The kidney! he cried suddenly.

He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.

Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.

Dearest Papli

Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me splendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy's Iovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am getting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano downstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday. There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan's (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan's) song about those seaside girls. Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest love

Your fond daughter, MILLY.

P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby. M.

Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first birthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old woman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn't live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.

His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing. Hurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the XL Cafe about the bracelet. Wouldn't eat her cakes or speak or look. Saucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do worse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.

O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild piece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now.

Vain: very.

He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a little. Was given milk too long. On the ERIN'S KING that day round the Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair. All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.

Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers' pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says. Pier with lamps, summer evening, band,

Those girls, those girls,
Those lovely seaside girls.

Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.

A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.

Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or through M'Coy.

The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait. Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.

He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.

—Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I'm ready.

Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.

A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as I'm.

In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits. He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.

Listening, he heard her voice:

—Come, come, pussy. Come.

He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. The maid was in the garden. Fine morning.

He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. Make a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur. All soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this that is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.

He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don't remember that. Hallstand too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters. Drago's shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown brillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say. O'Brien.

Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss. Enthusiast.

He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his countinghouse. Nobody.

Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a bit. Our prize titbit: Matcham's Masterstroke. Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.

Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat certainly. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now. Begins and ends morally. Hand in hand. Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.

Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for some proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.l5. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that cabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.

Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money. Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes. It wouldn't pan out somehow.

Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.

He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.

In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.

A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.

Heigho! Heigho!
Heigho! Heigho!
Heigho! Heigho!

Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air, third.

[Ludacris]
You better believe it is baby
Now go in the other room
It's about to be some grown folks talkin here, okay?
All right

Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be (okay)
Like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry (tell 'em!)
Talkin 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name? (woo!)
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session (okay)
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession (hey!)
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya about a grand so start savin your change (DTP!)
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps (uh-huh)
Sign yourself TO yourself and start signin ya own checks (woo!)
Hit the booth and start recordin at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowin, could be speed or weed (what else?)
Get it mixed and mastered (hey) pressed up and plastered (okay)
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be (hey!)
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me!

[Hook: Ludacris]
But I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
See mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems (yup)
Their money could be the problem but money can't solve 'em (nope)
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy (woo)
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy (woo!)
I'm close cause those close wanna live off my fame (yup)
And that type of shit ALONE'll drive a nigga insane (crazy!)
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandalous promoters (okay)
Crabs'll try to sue you, magazines'll misquote ya
Most of these label heads, they don't care nothin about ya (nah)
If you stop sellin records they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixin business with pleasure so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other DAY (for real!)
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass (true that)
All that, and this is really just the start of it (just the start of it)
Hip-Hop! You really wanna be a part of it?

Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is

What's worse than havin some money is grabbin and abusin it (yup)
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool with him (nah)
I wish his ass well but I don't want NOTHIN to do with him (woo!)
Some don't own they publishin; me? I never fool with 'em (nah)
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em (believe it)
Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant (DTP!)
Unless I'm still in competition with my president (what up Jay?)
And believe that I'm supportin the Hova
Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over (okay!)

696,Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron,"[Verse 1]
After the turn of the century
In the clear blue skies over Germany
Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard
Like the scream and the sound of a big war bird
Up in the sky, a man in a plane
Baron von Richthofen was his name
Eighty men tried, and eighty men died
Now they're buried together on the countryside

[Chorus]
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The Bloody Red Baron was rolling out the score
Eighty men died trying to end that spree
Of the Bloody Red Baron of Germany

[Verse 2]
In the nick of time, a hero arose
A funny-looking dog with a big black nose
He flew into the sky to seek revenge
But the Baron shot him down (Curses, foiled again!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now, Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man
So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan
He challenged the German to a real dogfight
While the Baron was laughing, he got him in his sight

[Musical interlude]

That Bloody Red Baron was in a fix
He'd tried everything, but he'd run out of tricks
Snoopy fired once, and he fired twice
And that Bloody Red Baron went spinning out of sight

I miss that smile that you had, it was infectious
I know you still with me, my angels are my protectors
I really wish you didn't have to go and take your life
I really wish you found another way to make it right
I got the news and I'm like, ""Nah dog, he ain't the type""
He's way stronger than that, he would've stayed to fight
But I ain't know about your demons and shit
That's what I hurt, just looking back you were screaming this shit
And ain't nobody come to rescue you
You let the devil get the best of you
You gotta ace it when he testin' you
But I'm gonna carry on your legacy
And focus on that silver lining you could never see
Bro' you should be in the league
Nobody had a better three
The moment that you let it go was the moment that you let it be
And I still don't get it, yeah
But I learn from it
That's why I always hit my brothers like, ""Let's burn something!""
'Cause I don't know when we gonna go and death is so unexpected

You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note

I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""

Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales

Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working

Sometimes it be like that

What you need right back

Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka

The sky has gone gray, it's now winter's day
The parks they are empty, no squeaks from the swings
No kids are at play, it's now winter's day

And here we are snuggled warm in each others arms
Listening to silent sound as the snow packs the ground
Perfumed hair that I smell, essence that I like so well

You are my winter, the days and the nights
In our hideaway, its now winter's day
Our love will grow stronger a minute has chilled
Inside we will play, it's now winter's day

Passed the test now

710,Ten Commandments,"And God spoke all these words, saying,
I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

1.
You shall have no other gods before me.

2.
You shall not make for yourself a carved image
Or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above
Or that is in the earth beneath
Or that is in the water under the earth
You shall not bow down to them or serve them,
For I the Lord your God am a jealous God
Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me
But showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments

3.
You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain
For the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain

4.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy
Six days you shall labor, and do all your work,
But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God
On it you shall not do any work
You, or your son, or your daughter
Your male servant, or your female servant
Or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates
For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them
And rested on the seventh day
Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy

5.
Honor your father and your mother
That your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.

6.
You shall not murder

7.
You shall not commit adultery

8.
You shall not steal

9.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor

10.
You shall not covet your neighbor's house
You shall not covet your neighbor's wife,
Or his male servant, or his female servant
Or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's",Holy Bible (KJV),1967,"[81, 85, 97, 99]",4
711,"Sunrise, Sunset","Sunrise, sunset
Sunrise, sunset
Swiftly go the days
Sunrise, sunset
You wake up, then you undress
It always is the same
The sunrise and the sunsets
You are lying while you confess, keep trying to explain
The sunrise and the sunsets
You realize then you forget what you've been trying to retain
But everybody knows that it is all about the things
That get stuck inside of your head
Like the songs your roommate sings
Or a vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed
She raised her hands in the air, asked you
When was the last time you looked in the mirror?
Cause you've changed
Yeah, you've changed


Sunrises, sunsets
You're hopeful then you regret
The circle never breaks
With a sunrise and a sunset there's a change of heart or address
Is there nothing that remains?
For a sunrise or a sunset
You're manic or you're depressed
Will you ever feel ok?
For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress
Did you really think she'd stay?
For a sunrise or a sunset
You're either coming or you just left but you're always on the way
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet
They are really just the same
To the sunrise and the sunset
The master and his servant have exactly the same fate
It's a sunrise and a sunset
From a cradle to a casket
There is no way to escape
The sunrise and the sunset
Hold your sadness like a puppet, keep putting on the play
But everything you do is leading to the point
Where you just won't know what to do
And at that moment you may laugh
But there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you
So it's true, the trick is complete
Become everything you said you never would be
You're a fool! You're a fool!


Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset
Sunrise and the sunsets
Sunrise, sunset, sunrises, sunsets
Sunrise and the sunsets

Go home to your apartment
And put the cassette in the tape deck and let that fever play

All around the world while they laughing to they last breath
Fuck that noise, fuck you, fuck your attitude
And fuck your little petty ass moves

Don't ask for me, I'm too far away
Busy making more shit while your ass on break
This ain't all I have to say, but if you want, you can stay

Leave you cold and at depression, had enough, sound of truth fulls

I make myself up
Just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home

Come today, in fact come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience caller bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you?

There lived a knight who
Wasn't quite as bold
As a knight should be

He rode an old grey mare called Bess
Searchin' for a damsel in distress
Just to see if he
Could set her free

See the knight in rusty armour ride
To her aid
Trusty sword is hanging at his side
With a rusty blade

Up the tower steps he sneaked
But as he moved
His rusty armour squeaked
Such a mournful note

And all the sentries at their posts
Thought it must have been the castle ghost
They jumped for their lives
In the moat

So the knight in rusty armour won
His fair maid
Had no need to draw his trusty sword
With a rusty blade

As he bent to kiss his bride
He found that he was rusted up inside
In his battle dress
And I can't guess

How they still got married and had twins

And you can change it but you gonna have to fix it

The sky blew me to you, no wind
Situation if you keep losing
All because the path that you choosing
If your skies gray, then I’ll turn ‘em blue
All you gotta do is call and I’m there for you
Pray all the flow colder than a polar
Bear, I’m there when you think no one cares
We got global warming but the world’s so cold
And how did that happen? I do not know
Yeah people change when you had a lot of pain
But sunshine is bright, what you waiting on the rain?
Umbrella for a Cinderella with no
Slipper, tell me how black and whites differ
You can’t, ‘cause we still the same people
One plus one, two, we equal

This life, got you looking in the mirror now
Tryna wipe away the smears, see it clearer now
‘cause you want the good life like they make it seem on the screen
But it’s really not the same, it’s a shame but
I swear it’s the facts and now
Everything is piling on you in stacks
Like the stacks you see with these rappers on Earth but
No amount can compare to what your life worth
Think about it
As kids with no food in the tummy
Now realize your life ain’t that crummy
And I really hope that you get this
Life can get grizzly, I’m tryna bear witness
‘cause you’re meant for something much greater
And you will get there, sooner or later
Thought comes to mind when I look at the skies
Look with your heart, you can’t see with your eyes
‘cause it’s more to see than what you’re looking at
And it gets hard, but that’s only if you’re looking back

[Verse 1]
Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing

Wild thing

[Verse 2]
Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night?""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

[Verse 3]
Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

[Hook]
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing

[Verse 4]
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""

Say what

I wanna feel it, no mercy
I reminisce you, I'm gonna go there
I know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care
'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you
Baby I-I, I'm gonna miss you

[Verse 2]
Most nights I try to stay away from any memory
From those nights when you were still sleepin', dreamin' next to me
But I'm 'bout to put on continue and slow dance in this burnin' room

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me
I'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me
I'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me
I wanna feel it, no mercy
I reminisce you, I'm gonna go there
I know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care
'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you
Baby I-I, I'm gonna miss you

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna think about Charleston, weekend Airbnb
And that Carolina heat had nothin' on you and me
I'm gonna think about that first kiss in the rain, it was June
Remember how we said forever? I'm gonna think about that too

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me
I'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me
I'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me
I wanna feel it, no mercy
I reminisce you, I'm gonna go there
I know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care

729,I've Passed This Way Before,"Life lends a crushing blow
And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats itself
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me

A dark cloud covered my heart
Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

No matter how strong a man is
Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart

A lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Because I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again",Jimmy Ruffin,1967,"[33, 28, 17, 18, 18, 23]",6

When I tell you I don't love you anymore?
When I command my lips to say
""It's over now, please go away""
Will the words be there
Or will they fail me like they've always done before?
Where will the words come
When I tell you I don't want you, I don't love you anymore

What happened to the love we had when it went away?
Did it change itself into a cloud & become a rainy day?
Where will the words come
When I tell you I don't want you, I don't love you anymore

Where will the words come from
When I tell you I don't love you anymore?
When I search inside my soul
For words to tell of love grown cold

Or will they fail me like they've always done before?

731,How Do You Catch A Girl,"Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?

Take a little piece of cheese and put it on a trap

And you're bound to catch a fish if you're calm enough to wait

But how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?

Daniel Boone took a rifle and a coonskin cap
And he found an icy river and he set a little trap
And he took a bit of jerky and he took a little nap
And he knew he'd catch a beaver or a fat muskrat

But how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?

I'd like to know how to catch a girl
I've caught frogs, I've caught snakes, earthworms
And they may be nice
But girls, oh

Well, I asked the local lover and he told me what to do
He said learn the rocking dances both old and new
But it's hard to do those dances with two left feet
So I've got to find a method that'll work for me

Oh, how do you catch a girl?
How do you catch a girl?
Won't somebody tell me please?
How do you catch a girl?

I wish I knew

Uh, you know he better kick me good
I'm off to Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Sugar Town

733,Look What You've Done,"[Produced by Chase N. Cashe and Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place.

Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
When the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the nightbird song
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees that worship the wind
And if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room filled with empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til your next hello
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes, that I love so much

But if you go, I won't cry

So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me, hit me on Twitter
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name

Headin' to the fortune fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin bout
Pour a little liquor then I drink it down

Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank god for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gate
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and
Burn out all the lights in

Cause I know I've got no shame

We started slipping away

What's building up inside of you burns deep inside of your hear
What seems right in front of you is often in the distance ahead
Well everyone around of me spends up all of their time
Well I've got one thing on my mind

I wonder what went wrong
Cause I know I must be strong
I wonder who's to blame
Cause I know I've got no shame

He'll ever survive

He's the kind of frogman
Wearing twenty pounds
Of counter weights and
Sinking in the sea like a stone

He's the kind of soldier
Got no sense of direction
And they send him
In the jungle alone

But when the
Frost's on the pumpkin
And the litle girls are jumping
He's a hard loving son of a gun

He's got em waiting downstairs
Just to sample his affairs
And they call him
A spoonful of fun

Going riding on a skateboard
And his mind's raging
Out of control

He's the kind of person
Goes to drive a Maserati
Puts his key inside
The wrong little hole

He's the kind of ski bum
Tearing wild down the mountain
Hits a patch where
There ain't any snow

He's the kind of cowboy
Got a hot trigger finger
Shoots his boot cause
He's drawing kind of slow

But when he comes in for bowling
He's an expert at rolling
Sets the pins up
And lays em right down

He's got em taking off their heels
And they like the way he feels
And they call him a carnival clown

Well, he's got a parachute
And screaming like Geronimo
And makes a little hole
In the ground

He's the kind of logger
When the man hollers, timber
Got to stop and look
Around for the sound

He's the kind of artist
Rents a groovy little attic
And discovers that he
Log on to Top40db
Can't grow a beard

He's the human cannonball
Come in for a landing
And he wonders where
The net disappeared

Ah, woman, woman your touch, your touch has gone cold

776,Full Measure,"INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

We slowly turn right, leaving the fireplace as we take a tour around the completely empty room. But as we finish clocking around 270 degrees, we find a man in a dark suit, facing the front door with a small notebook in his hands.

KNOCK-KNOCK! The man closes his notebook and opens the front door.

REALTOR: Well, hello again.

A much younger Skyler and Walt make their way into the house.

SKYLER: Hi, I hope we’re not too late.

REALTOR: No, no. Perfect timing.

SKYLER: Okay. Stan, this is my husband Walt.

WALT: Hi.

REALTOR: Good to meet you, Walt.

WALT: Nice to meet you.

Walt and the realtor shake hands

REALTOR: Sandia Laboratories, huh?

WALT: Yeah.

REALTOR: I hear some pretty fascinating stuff goes on out there.

WALT: Yeah, well, you know...

REALTOR: Working on anything you can talk about? I’m picturing giant space lasers. Am I right?

WALT: what I do would bore you senseless. Giant space lasers? Now that sounds cool. I’ll have to bring it up at our next staff meeting.

REALTOR: Well, just remember I get a cut!

WALT: Alright. It’s a deal.

Everybody laughs. Walt glances around the living room.

SKYLER: So... this is it, honey. Whaddya say? Do you wanna take a tour

WALT: Sure.

REALTOR: Uh, look. How about, uh, I give ya’ll some privacy? I’ll, uh, go out to the car, make a few calls, and uh... take as much time as you need.

SKYLER: Okay, thanks.

The man exits the house, leaving them alone.

SKYLER: He’s actually a nice guy. He doesn’t push.

WALT: Yeah.

Skyler leads Walt on a tour around the house.

SKYLER: So, as you can see, there’s a kinda flow going on here. It’s a nice big living room. And this is the dining area.

WALT: Ah, the dining “area.” Right.

Skyler pulls aside a sheer drape revealing the backyard so Walt can glance out the patio door.

SKYLER: Oh, and uh... it’s got a pool...

WALT: Pool is nice. Backyard could be a little bigger.

SKYLER: And oh, there’s uh, a breakfast bar kinda dealie here, which is nice. And um, the kitchen’s really spacious, and you know... got good appliances.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY

Skyler and Walt start to tour the back of the house

WALT: How many bedrooms?

SKYLER: Three. Told you. They’re all pretty good size. Oh, and this is the first one here. And there’s-there’s two more at the back.

WALT: Only three bedrooms? I think we’re gonna need at least five, don't you think?

SKYLER: Five? What, do I look like I’m about to drop a litter?

WALT: No-no-no-no-no. We’ll have three kids total, eventually. You know, but well need a spare room for a study so that I can work at home and you can write. Yeah, nah. I don’t think this is gonna be enough.

SKYLER: Okay, um, about a wine cellar? I mean, we certainly cannot be expected to live without a wine cellar.

WALT: Very funny. I just think we need to set our sights high is all. At least higher then here.

SKYLER: Walt, this is a good neighborhood. It’s got a good elementary, and supposedly a very good high school. And believe me, cause I have definitely looked everywhere - for our price range, this is as good as it gets.

WALT: Well, then, let’s stretch our price range. Truly. I mean why buy a starter house when we’ll have to move out of in a year or two.

SKYLER: Did you win the lottery and not tell me?

WALT: I’m serious. Come on.... why be cautious? We’ve got nowhere to go but up.

INT. AZTEK

Walt waits out here alone keeping his eyes peeled, scanning the area as he makes sure no one sneaks up on him. A black car drifts into view, creeping along the horizon. It heads our way for awhile, but it comes to a stop keeping its distance.

RING-RING! Walt’s cell phone startles us. He answers it putting the phone to his right ear.

WALT: Yeah.

MIKE: Walter, you see us?

WALT: Yeah. I see you.

MIKE: I’d like you to exit your vehicle and start walking toward us.

WALT: And then what? I’m gonna need some... some kind of assurance.

MIKE: I assure you I could kill you from way over here, if it makes you feel any better.

Walt closes his phone and then climbs out of the Aztek.

EXT. GRASSLANDS

Walt starts walking... and walking towards the vehicle, which is still a black dot on the horizon. In the distance, a figure climbs out of the vehicle, and makes there way toward us.

MIKE: Walter. You’ve been busy. You wanna put your arms out to your sides for me, if you would.

Walt does as he’s told, standing as Mike gives him a pat-down.

MIKE: You know I haven’t slept since Thursday? I was out all night cleaning up after you. I need my sleep.

WALT: You said no half measures.

MIKE: Yeah? Funny how words can be so open to interpretation.

The two of them head for the vehicle, walking side-by-side.

MIKE: You get your car fixed?

WALT: Not yet.

MIKE: You’re gonna wanna get your car fixed.

WALT: Let’s see how this goes first.

EXT. SUBURBAN

Victor climbs out from the driver’s seat, standing beside the hood as he waits. Gus then emerges from the vehicle, making his toward Walt, not looking happy. They both stand motionless. Silence.

GUS: Has your condition worsened?

WALT: Excuse me?

GUS: Your medical condition. Has it grown worse?

WALT: Not that I know of, no.

GUS: Is there a ringing in your ears? Are you seeing bright lights, or hearing voices?

WALT: I’m quite well, thank you.

GUS: No, clearly you’re not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself.

WALT: My partner was about to get himself shot. I intervened.

GUS: Some worthless junkie. For him, you intervene and put us all at risk. Some contemptible junkie who couldn’t keep the peace for eight hours.

WALT: That’s right. He couldn’t. He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an eleven year-old boy.

GUS: I heard about it. He should have let me take care of them.

WALT: Maybe. Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.

GUS: Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child?

WALT: I would never ask you that.

GUS: Where is Pinkman now?

WALT: I wouldn’t know.

WALT: A couple of time zones away, at least. Beyond that, I’d only be guessing. He has enough money to last forever, and he knows to keep moving. You’ll never find him.


MIKE: I dunno, Walt. It’s what I do, after all.

Walt glances at Mike, and then looks back to Gus.

WALT: He’s out of the picture. I saved his life - I owed him that. But now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you wanted, isn’t it?

Gus sighs and stares off into the distance.

WALT: You’ve always struck me as a very pragmatic man. So if I may, I would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me, you have two. Option A - you kill me right here and now. Apparently I have made that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses, and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him, too. A pointless exercise it seems to me, but that is Option A.

GUS: What is Option B?

WALT: I continue cooking. You and I both forget about Pinkman. We forget this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer Option B.

GUS: You’d need a new assistant.

Walt nods.

WALT: I could get right on that.

GUS: No. This time I choose.

Walt nods again. Finished with Walt, Gus turns and heads back to the vehicle. Victor does the same, climbing behind the wheel.  Once Walt realizes he’s been dismissed, he turns, and starts his long walk back to his Aztek.

MIKE: Your car. Get it fixed.

WALT: Yeah.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY

Walt’s Aztek drives toward us, the grille in frame, as we note that damage from the hit-and-run had been repaired.

Walt reverses into his usual spot, cuts the engine and climbs out. He pauses to look at what’s parked beside him before heading for the laundry.

INT. LAB

Walt takes his key from his pocket and tries to unlock the door, but it doesn’t seem to work anymore. Victor then comes into view and opens the door for him. Walt steps past Victor onto the catwalk and makes his way down the spiral staircase.

Walt crosses the floor of the lab toward a man who stands waiting.

WALT: It’s good to see you.

The camera turns to Reveal Gale Boetticher, who shakes Walt’s hand.

GALE: Thanks. It’s good to be back. Well, Shall we?

WALT: By all means, Gale. Let’s cook

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

A Buick pulls past us into frame and parks.

MIKE: What about that rhinoceros? You think he’d make a good pet?

GRANDDAUGHTER: No!

MIKE: No? Don’t you think if you called to him, he’d come running for his supper? I’ll bet he would.

INT. BUICK

MIKE: I’ll bet he’d come running - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

GRANDDAUGHTER: You’re silly Pop-Pop.

MIKE: Well... a little. But he’d probably knock everything over. Plus, there’s that big nose of his.

GRANDDAUGHTER: That’s not a nose, that’s a horn.

MIKE: Is that so?

GRANDDAUGHTER: His real nose is little.

MIKE: Huh. I learn all kinds of things being with you.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET

Mike opens the backseat door of the Buick and pulls out a few balloons, which he hands to his granddaughter, who stands by.

MIKE: Okay, Junebug, these are for you?

GRANDDAUGHTER: What about the rest?

MIKE: The rest are for me.

GRANDDAUGHTER: No, they’re not. You’re too old for balloons.

MIKE: Oh, you’re never too old for balloons.

MIKE: Give me a hug. I see your Mom. Don’t keep her waiting.

GRANDDAUGHTER: Bye, Pop-Pop!

MIKE: Bye, baby.

The girl headed up the walkway of a nearby house. To a woman who was standing waiting on the porch. She waves to Mike, who waves back. Mike heads round to his driver’s door, climbing back in, starting the engine and driving away.

EXT. WAREHOUSE

Mike stands by his Buick, watching the warehouse from the cover of darkness. No one is in sight. He opens the back door of his car and gathers all those balloons and wanders toward the power pole that feeds the building. We cut to a different angle and watch Mike let go of his balloons, which float straight up until they envelop the power lines.

INT. WAREHOUSE - BACK ROOM

A flatscreen monitor which is split by four live security camera views of the outside of the building goes dead as we plunge into darkness.

FIRST MEXICAN MAN: What do you think? (in Spanish)

SECOND MEXICAN MAN: Only one way to find out. (in Spanish)

Both of them head for the front of the building, armed with handguns.

EXT. WAREHOUSE

The faces of the two Mexican men appear in the window on the door and ease it open. First one man, then the other, step outside, scanning the area for trouble. But they don't see what's hidden just around the corner of the building, and after hearing a faint snap sound, the Mexicans freeze.

SECOND MEXICAN MAN: What was that? (in Spanish)

Mike instantly steps around the corner and shoots the nearest Mexican point-blank through the head. The bullet continues into the second man, who was standing on top the steps, and it even passes through him, shattering the window in the warehouse door behind him.

INT. WAREHOUSE - FRONT ROOM

Mike makes his way across the room, hearing a sound behind a counter. He raises his gun, ready to fire, but pauses when he sees a Chinese secretary sitting on the floor. She holds up her hands, talking fast. Mike raises a finger to his lips, employing the symbol for “be quiet.”

SECRETARY: Please... please...

Mike then sits beside the secretary and takes hold of her nearest foot, taking off one of her shoes. While taking cover, Mike throws the shoe the length of the hall, drawing out a thrid Mexicans man.

THIRD MEXICAN MAN: AAAAAAAAAAAGGGHH!

From the other end of the hallway, he runs at us, firing his gun wildly, passing Mike in the front office, who stands up against the wall, raising his silenced pistol and firing three bullets into him. Mike then pads down the dark hall toward the far end of the warehouse.

INT. WAREHOUSE - HALLWAY/BACK ROOM

As we travel further down the hall, a Chinese man comes into view. He sits at the front of a desk, staring at Mike wide-eyed, with his hands raised in surrender.

Mike pauses before he exits the hall. Silently pressing the muzzle of his pistol to the wall, where there is a fourth Mexican man hiding. He looks over to Chow for confirmationm, who raised his hands higher.  Mike correspondingly slides his pistol higher up the wall, and glanced back over to Chow - good? Chow blinks and gives a slight nod.

BANG! Mike fires through the wall, hitting the hidden man right in the head.

MIKE: Chow. You have anything you wanna tell me?

CHOW: Thank God you’re here! They keep me prisoner!

MIKE: They keep you prisoner.

CHOW: I don’t do nothing for them ever! They try and make me, I say no! They steal my chemicals? I can’t stop them! I am businessman!

MIKE: You’re a businessman. The lady out front, Hey lady, are you still there? Ask her if she’s still there.

CHOW: Peng, are you still there?

She responds in Chinese off-camera in length.

CHOW: She says yes.

MIKE: How’s her driving?

Chow is confused by the question.

MIKE: Driving. Is she good behind the wheel?

CHOW: Good. She’s good driver.

MIKE: Licensed? Dependable?

CHOW: She has a Camry.

MIKE: Good.

Mike abruptly raises his pistol and fires a bullet through Chow’s raised left hand.

MIKE: The trucks’ll be here first thing in the morning. I strongly recommend that you return our calls next time. So..? Have her drive you to the hospital.

Holding his hand, Chow stumbles toward the hallway...

MIKE: She’s gonna need her shoe.

Chow stumbles back and picks up the woman’s shoe with his right hand.

INT. LOS POLLOS HERMANOS - OFFICE

On the desk are four visa border crossing cards.

GUS: Where did they cross?

MIKE: Laredo, looks like. They didn’t exactly send their “A” players. But like you said, it’s cartel, alright.

GUS: Probing for weakness.

MIKE: Well. They didn’t find any.

Gus doesn’t seem so sure, sitting in silence. Mike Figured it was time to leave, but Gus glances up at him, and starts a new subject.

GUS: What about Pinkman?

MIKE: I’m making inquiries.

Mike exits the room.

INT. LAB

Walt and Gale are wearing respirators and tending to the mix/cook tank.

WALT: That’s two. Alright, let’s close it up.

Walt shuts the tank’s lid.

WALT: Alright, bring it down. Ready? Okay, we’re good

Walt looks up to Victor, who was on the catwalk reading a newspaper.

WALT: You can take your mask off now.

GALE: Does that guy ever leave..

Walt shrugs

GALE: When exactly did that start?

WALT: It’s new. We had a little drama with the person you replaced.

GALE: Sorry to hear that.

WALT: Nah, nah. it’ll fine. Things’ll continue to smooth out and... yeah. It’ll be fine.

GALE: By the way, if you’re at all worried about working with me...

WALT: No. I’m not.

GALE: whatever my shortcomings last time, I intend for things to go perfectly from here on out. So if there’s...

WALT: Gale, you’re great. Seriously.

GALE: I just, however you like things to be done, is exactly how we’re going to do them. Period. From here on out. So Please. Teach me.

WALT: Okay.

INT. GALES APARTMENT

Music is playing on a stereo, and Gale is singing along to it. But a a knock on the door turns his attention. He puts down his watering can and answers the door. Gale is surprised to find Gus once he opens the door.

GUS: Gale. It’s good to see you.

GALE: Mr. Fring. Wow, this is, uh...

GUS: I should have called first. I’m not interrupting anything, am I?

GALE: No, not at all. Please, come in!

Gus enters the house

GALE: Can I offer you something? A creme de menthe?

GUS: Oh, no, no, thank you. I’m sorry for the inconvenience

GALE: Oh, no, no. It’s no inconvenience.

GUS: I need to talk to you about something. Something rather pressing.

GUS: If push came to shove, I was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself. You, and an assistant.

Gale thinks for a moment.

GALE: Why would... Why would push come to shove?

GUS: Has Walter ever talked to you about why he got into this particular line of work?

GALE: Uh... I guess I assumed it’s because it pays so well.

GUS: Oh, it is. But specifically, has he ever spoken to you about his health problems? I’m not surprised. He’s a very private person.

GALE: What exactly are his health problems?

GUS: He’s dying of cancer. It is why he does this. To provide for his family. Which he’s accomplished. They will never want for anything - he’s seen to that.

GALE: Oh... how long does he have?

GUS: That is very much the question. He does not want to talk about it. And every time I bring it up with him... I don’t know that he’s fully
accepted the reality of it. And, not to sound cold-blooded but I am running a business here.

GALE: No, I understand...

GUS: I have a very large investment in this. There’s so much overhead that I can’t afford to shut down. Not
even for a week. So you understand my concern. And my desire for continuity.

GALE: I do. Absolutely.

GUS: Now, I intend to keep Walter on for as long as he wants, assuming he’s physically up to it. But as he cannot or will not tell me how long
that might be. I must prepare for the worst-case scenario.

GALE: Worst-case scenario... Uh, I suppose if we had at least a few more cooks together.

GUS: You don’t think you’re ready now?

GALE: Well, he is such a, a master. There’s always more for me to learn. But I’m thinking that if we had say... one or two more cooks

Gus silently stares at Gale

GALE: One more, I guess, would do it. I suppose.

Gus pats Gale’s knee

GUS: I believe in you, Gale. I know that when the time comes, you will be ready.

INT. LAB

Both Gale and Walt are scrubbing away gunk from the inside of the tank. Gale looks distracted, glancing across at Walt, who was working on the opposite side of the tank. Eventually Walt looks up from his scrubbing to find Gale looking at him.

WALT: What’s up?

Gale shakes his head, forcing a smile, and gets back into his work. But a few moments, he changes his mind.

GALE: Walt. Is there, um...

Victor wanders into view. Standing up beside Gale, glancing down into the tank.

GALE: ...any particular trick to purging the catalyst bed?

WALT: No, it’s pretty straightforward. I’ll show you when we get there.

Gale nods, and both he and Walt return to scrubbing. Victor soon wanders off.

EXT. SAUL GOODMAN’S OFFICE

Saul is lying on the floor of his office, loosening up his spine. When a faint sound prompts him to answer his Bluetooth earpiece.

SAUL: Yeah? Tell him I’m in conference.

He clicks off his earpiece and shuts his eyes. But after a moment or two, we hear the door open and close. And an unwanted visitor makes his way toward Saul.

SAUL: Can’t you see I’m in conference?

MIKE stands over Saul

MIKE: I’m looking to find a client of yours. I was hoping you could help me out with an address.

SAUL: Which client?

MIKE: Jesse Pinkman.

SAUL: Jesse-Pinkman-In-The-Phone-Book, Jesse Pinkman? Hmm, how would one track him down, I wonder?

Mike, with the tip of his shoe, clicks the power switch on the machine.

SAUL: You’re still here?

MIKE: I’m gonna need your full attention, Saul. Jesse Pinkman. Current whereabouts. The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to whatever the hell this is exactly.

SAUL: What am I, eighth-grade hall monitor? “Current whereabouts?”  Let me tell you something, Mike

Saul starts to rise in protest, but Mike stops him with a warning hand.

MIKE: Whoa. You are good right there. Let’s both get comfortable.

Mike takes a chair right next to Saul, who stays on the floor.

MIKE: Now, when I say I’m looking for Pinkman, we both know why. Don’t we? And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me.

SAUL:  Look, Mike... there are rules to this lawyer thing.

MIKE: Is that right?

SAUL: SAUL Yeah. “Attorney-client privilege?” I mean, that’s a big one! And that’s something I provide for you! So, if I give up Pinkman... well, then you’re gonna be asking “old Saul gives ‘em up pretty easy. What’s to keep him from giving me up?” You see? So, then, where’s the trust?

MIKE: I trust the hole in the desert I’d leave you in.

SAUL: Yeah... that’s an argument.

MIKE: Saul, don’t make me beat you till your legs don’t work. Now tell me where to find him. You know it’s the right thing.

Saul considers his options.

SAUL: I can’t tell you, Mike. Alright? If I was to tell you, well I just... I couldn’t live with myself. I’m sorry.

Mike quickly rises to his feet, ready to beat the shit out of Saul.

SAUL: But who’s to say I didn’t write the address down in my day-planner?

Saul scrambles to his feet and round his desk, looking through his scheduler.

SAUL: Or on a scratch piece of paper... somewhere. Who’s to say I didn’t write down a location? Strictly for my own professional use.

Finding it written on a notepad, Saul places the pad on his desk.

SAUL: Do NOT touch anything on my desk. I’m gonna leave the room... uh, make myself a Nescafe.

Saul leaves the office, closing the door behind him. Mike steps around the desk and opens Saul’s notepad to find the address. ""Buckingham Trailer Court, Dillwyn, VA.”

EXT. STREET - WHITE CADILLAC DRIVING

SAUL: I’m just looking out for you, that’s all. I’m like a mother hen.

INT. SAUL’S CADILLAC - DRIVING

Walt sits beside Saul in the Cadillac

SAUL: Believe me, money-laundering ain’t what it used to be. God, do I miss the 80s.

WALT: You’re wasting your time - I’m buying the car wash. End of story.

SAUL: Well, one look at this place, you’re gonna fall in love.

EXT. LASER TAG

The Cadillac pulls into a deserted parking lot. Both Saul and Walt climb out, with Saul proudly presenting the place.

SAUL: Huh? Was I right? Where else you gonna find a cash-only business that’s this much fun? Unless we’re talking massage parlor, and, uh... I don’t see it! Shall we?

Saul dangles the keys

SAUL: Shall we?

Both Saul and Walt head to the front door. Victor clearly had followed them here, keeping his distance, as we see his car appear a few hundred yards away.

SAUL: You ever actually play laser tag? You know... it’s good cardio. Plus you get to shoot at kids...

INT. LASER TAG

Saul and Walt stroll through the place, flipping switches and turning on lights.


SAUL: You got your bumper cars over there down that way. Got your arcade right here - all the latest video games. Snack bar’s over there. Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents. That’s a whole new revenue stream...

WALT: Alright, alright, alright already. We’re-we’re good.

SAUL: Holy Christ.

Saul stops dead, and catches his breath

SAUL: “We’re GOOD?” This constitutes “good” where you’re from? My car is bugged.

WALT: I said maybe. Maybe bugged.

SAUL: I’m being followed?! What the hell have you gotten me into? I got my very own PI threatening to break my legs! That’s like Thomas Magnum threatening, that, that Little prissy guy with the mustache. Over and above. Service-wise, this is over and above. You and I survive this? Oh, I’m seriously rethinking my pricing. Yeah. And that goes double for you, HipHop!

Saul points at Jesse, who steps into view from out of the darkness.

SAUL: My guy’s no dummy, right? So, I give us maybe twenty-four hours before he figures out that address goes nowhere. You guys do your thing, make it snappy. I’ll go... see if they have Tetris or something.

Saul wanders off toward the arcade, leaving Walt and Jesse alone.

WALT: How you holding up?

Jesse shrugs

JESSE: You..?

WALT: I got my old job back. At least, until they kill me, and Gale takes over.

JESSE: So, he’s their boy, huh?

WALT: He’s their boy.

JESSE: How long you think you’ve got?

WALT: Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process. I try to be as vague as possible, but I’ve got that guy Victor watching me, listening to every word I say... You know it may be that the only thing saving me is Gale’s fastidiousness. Once he feels confident that he knows my entire method...

Silence. Walt makes a gesture - that’s when they kill me.

JESSE: So, what do we do?

WALT: You know what we do.

Jesse starts shaking his head.

JESSE: There’s got to be some other way. Maybe it’s better for you to just go to the cops, alright? I mean, I can’t believe I’m saying that and all. But for your family? I mean, the DEA would love you - all the shit you could tell them? Federal witness protection, that’s a good deal. As for me? I’ll hit the road, yo. I’ll make it. We had a, we had a good run. But it’s over.

WALT: Never the DEA. The cook can’t stop. That’s the one thing I’m certain of - production cannot stop. Gus can’t afford to. So, if I’m the only chemist that he’s got... then I’ve got leverage. And leverage keeps me alive. It keeps you alive, too. I think I can see to that. IF I’m the only chemist that he’s got.

JESSE: I can’t do it, Mr. White. Like you said, I’m-I’m not a... I can’t do it.

WALT: I’ll do it. I’m gonna need your help. I mean, they’re watching me day and night. They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment. Hell, I don’t even know where the man lives. He’s not in the phone book, I can’t find him on the Internet. I can’t do it in the lab. Victor’s always there. But if I could just shake Victor, for even an hour one night, I think then that I may be able to make it look like an accident.

JESSE: There’s got to be some other way.

WALT: I’m all ears. But when it comes down to you and me versus him? I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry, but it’s gonna be him. And you are the only edge that I’ve got, as long as they don’t know that you’re in town. But I need you to track him. Get me his address. And I’ll do the rest. Look, I saved your life, Jesse. Are you gonna save mine?

INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

The exact shot which opened the episode. Except this time the house is not empty, and we see Skyler preparing dinner. We continue to make our way around the room until we find Walt seated on the sofa, with Holly in his arms. Walt's cell phone starts to vibrates, and he digs it from his pocket, checking who's calling.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - BATHROOM

Walt makes his way into the bathroom, locking the door behind him and calling back, who called him before.

JESSE: Yeah.

WALT: Please tell me you found him.

JESSE: Sixty-three fifty-three Juan Tabo Boulevard. Apartment six.

Walt stands in silence for a few moments

JESSE: You there..?

WALT: Yeah. Sixty-three fifty-three Juan Tabo, number six. Got it. He’s home?

JESSE: Yep.

WALT: Anyone watching the place?

JESSE: No. Looks pretty much wide-open. When you gonna do it?

WALT: Tonight. Once it gets dark.

More silence. Walt’s body language suggesting he had a heavy weight on his shoulders.

JESSE: Don’t do this, Mr. White. Please? Go to the cops.

Walt lowers the phone from his ear, folding it closed.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE

Walt exits out the front door into the night. But just as he was going to unlock his car Victor pulls up, blocking the bottom of the driveway.

VICTOR: We got a problem. There’s some kinda chemical leaking in your lab. You gotta come with me.

Caught off-guard, Walt struggles to find a way out.

WALT: I’ll, uh... I’ll follow you.

VICTOR: They tell me to bring you, I bring you. come on, get in the car.

Walt does as he’s told and climbs into the front seat beside Victor.

INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY

A steel truck frame, slowly rolls upward revealing Victor and Walt, standing outside. Walt looks to Victor, who motions - you first. Walt enters, walking toward the back of the building and Victor follows close.

MIKE: I don’t know if it’s a barrel leak or what but you got something mighty stinky down there. After you.

Walt stares behind the enormous machine. He’s frozen

MIKE: Walter. The sooner you figure out what this is, the sooner we all go home.

Walt starts to beg for his life

WALT: Please don’t do this. Mike..? You don’t have to do this.

MIKE: Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter. Downstairs.

WALT: I’ll cook, I’ll cook for free! And there won’t be any more trouble! I promise you. If I could just talk to Gus, I know I can make him understand! Please! If I can talk to Gus, I can convince him...

MIKE: No... no...

WALT: Just let me, please. Please?! Please let me talk to him!

MIKE: Shut up. Shut up. I can’t do it. I’m sorry.

WALT: I’ll give you Jesse Pinkman. Okay? Like you said, he’s the problem! He’s ALWAYS been the problem! Without him, we would And he’s-he’s in TOWN, alright?! He’s not in Virginia or wherever the hell you’re looking for him - he’s right here in Albuquerque! And I can take you to him! I’ll take you RIGHT TO him! Huh? What do you say..?

MIKE: Where is he right now? You give me an address.

WALT: I don’t... He moves, he moves around. But if you let me call him. No, no... please. I just, my phone, it’s just my phone. I’ll call him and have him meet me. Alright? Okay? Okay?

Walt slowly, reaches in his jacket pocket for his cell phone. He holds it up to Mike, desperate for him to say yes.

INT. LASER TAG

Jesse has his back against the wall, in the laser tag snack bar. Jesse raises a glass pipe to his lips ready to heat it with a lighter. But suddenly His phone vibrates. and he reaches for the it. Hoping to hear news from Walt.

JESSE:  Did you do it..? Mr. White? Did you do it?

INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY

Walt holds his cell phone to his ear, with Mike and Victor standing by his side listening to the call.

WALT: No. I didn’t do it. I can’t now. It’s gonna have to be you.

JESSE: What? No WAY, man!

WALT: Listen to me. You’re closer than we are. You’ll have about a twenty minute lead. They’ve got me at the laundry and they’re gonna kill me. Jesse, do
it now! Do it fast. Do it, Jesse. Do it!

VICTOR: Son of a BITCH!

Mike grabs up the phone off Walt, while Victor yanks him aside.

Back at the laser tag, Jesse gets to his feet, grabs his pistol and sprints from sight.

Mike hangs up Walt’s phone, and pockets it. He turns to Walt, who stands his ground.

MIKE: Now, just what the hell was that, exactly?

WALT: You might wanna hold off.

Mike cocks back his pistol, ready to shoot Walt...

MIKE: Yeah? Why?

WALT: Because your boss is gonna need me. Sixty-three fifty-three Juan Tabo, apartment six.

Mike and Victor, glance to one another uneasily.

WALT: Yeah.

Immediately, Victor is running for the door. While Mike with his free hand fumbles for his own phone, speed-dialing someone.

INT. GALES APARTMENT

Gale's cell phone vibrates, but the music that's plays on Gale’s stereo is masking the phone’s sound. A tea kettle whistles on the stove. and hand comes into frame, pouring hot water into a mug. Gale is here alone, enjoying his night.

A loud KNOCK at the door cuts through the music. Wondering who this could be, Gale wanders through the living room, cutting off the stereo along the way. Gale opens his door to find Jesse, who stands Breathless and wide-eyed.

GALE: Hi. How can I help you?

Jesse raises his gun at Gale

GALE: Oh, oh um

Gale’s hands go up, as he gingerly backs off, not making any sudden moves.

Jesse steps into the apartment, closing the gap between them.

GALE: Take whatever you want. I have money, I’ve got a lot of money...I have, um...

Jesse pistol hand begins to tremble, his hands now shaking, but his eyes never leave Gale.

GALE: Please don’t do this. You don’t, you... you, you don’t have to do this.

777,Born Free,"[Verse 1]
Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But, tell them if I don't survive

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 2]
Free, like a river raging
Strong as the wind I’m facing
Chasing dreams and racing father time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can’t see my heart you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can’t keep no chains on me

[Chorus]
I was born free!
I was born free!
I was born free, born free

[Verse 3]
And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Calm, facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high

[Chorus]

Bright, sparkling diamonds
But believe me, dear when I say,
That he can give you the world,
But he'll never love you the way

He can take you anyplace he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane

Your eyes have told me so
Blue and black times
You think that I don't know
But there'll be glad times
Just you wait and see
And I'll be your sunrise if you'll lean on me

I imagine that I could comfort you
I have forgotten the things that you've been through
But here's one thing
On which we can agree
When you're ailing darlin' you can lean on me

And the love I bring
Will grow into a lasting thing
Put your heart on wings
That set you free
And as you rise
Up into the clearing skies
Maybe you will realize
You can lean on me

All your heartaches
Are hidden deep inside
So there's no telling
How many tears you've cried

Told the weeping willow tree

She made a ride that caused a scene
In the town

Hangin' down around her knees
All the cats who dig striptease
Prayin' for a little breeze

Her long blonde hair
Fallin' down across her arms
Hidin' all the lady's charms
Lady Godiva

She found fame and made her name
A Hollywood director came
Into town

And said to her
""How'd you like to be a star?
You're a girl that could go far
Specially dressed the way you are""

She smiled at him
Gave her pretty head a shake
That was Lady G's mistake, a-hey-hey-hey
Lady Godiva

He directs certificate 'X'
And people now are cranin' their necks
To see her

'Cause she's a star
The one that everybody knows
Finished with the striptease shows
Now, she can't afford her clothes

Her long blonde hair
Lyin' on the barber's floor
Doesn't need it long anymore

Paths of dark and light
And I have seen the sunrise
And I've seen the night

I've seen the calm before
The storm and then the fight
And now I see the sparrows
As they begin to fly
And all that's left
For me to do is cry

I've had my view of happiness
And my view of despair
I've cleaned out all the cobwebs
And I've learned how to compare

I've seen all of the circles
And I've had my last affair
And now I see the sparrows
As they begin to fly
And all that's left
For me to do is cry

Thinking that I was lost
Then finding the end
To all beginnings
Gave to me the key
Made of lead and golden
Freeing locks, Pandora's boxes
Devils are expended
And I'm finally free

And when all the
Tears are finally cried
And I am finally clean inside
The gentle winds will come
And they will dry my mind

And I will see the sparrow
That need no longer fly
And all that will be left
For me to do is die",The Association,1967,[44],1

I got a word or two cuz I don't understand
What's with me and you it's getting outta hand

Why can't we just talk and figure this thing out

I used to think that you and me would stay together
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?

You make me come with you and then you give me grief
When I try to go you never let me leave
If I shut my mouth you think that I don't care
When I try to help you say it's your affair

It's not the way that you and me should treat each other
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?
Why oh why can't we see eye to eye?

It's breakin' my heart we're grown' apart
An' we never seem to agree
