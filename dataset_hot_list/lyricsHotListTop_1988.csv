0,Every Rose Has Its Thorn,"[Verse 1]
We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

[Verse 2]
I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn

[Bridge]
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

[Verse 3]
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

[Verse 4]
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn",Poison,1988,"[1, 1, 2, 6, 10, 16, 23, 32, 42, 60]",10
1,My Prerogative,"Get busy!

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (Now now)
Why don't they just let me live? (Ooh)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (OH!)
That's my prerogative

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy, I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn
Getting girls is how I live
Some ask me questions, ""Why am I so real?""
But they don't understand me or really don't know the deal
About a brother, trying hard to make it right
Not long ago, before I win this fight (sing)

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission

I can do just what I feel (It's my prerogative)
No one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)
'Cause what I'm doing

Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped

Make my own decisions (...my own decisions)
That's my prerogative

[Outro]
What is this, a blizzard, that I can't have money in my pocket
And people not talk about me?
This world is a trip; I don't know what's going on these days
Got this person over here talking about me, this person
Ay, listen, let me tell you something, it's my prerogative
I can do what I wanna do
I made this money, you didn't; right, Ted?
We outta here!

It's my, it's my, it's my, it's my
It's my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

2,Look Away,"[Verse 1]
Two eyes staring back at me
From a magazine in my room
Cut out paper tragedies
Paper tragedies that I glue
Show up cause of memory
If it only feels black and blue?
Creating a fantasy
Something I can dream
That is true

[Hook]
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
If you say

[Verse 2]
I don't see it
Another message left for me in code
Hieroglyphics
I never figured out how to
Unfold your paper crane's origami agony
I ripped the edges
It gave me pleasure
Figuring it out
Each question in a shroud
It's been forever, wasn't forever

[Hook]
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
If you say

[Bridge]
Now when I close my eyes I see how much I've lost
From scratching a memory 'til all the colors off
Revealing a jagged line still there in black and white
When I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
But I can't laugh about it yet
It's all too soon
The things we used to joke about have all come true
I had to slowly back away

[Hook]
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
I will only look away
If you say
If you say
I will never look away

3,Giving You The Best That I Got,"[Verse 1]
Ain't there something I can give you?
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind
And make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out of reach

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together
We can calm a stormy sea

[Hook]
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes, I tell you now
That I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again

[Hook]
We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me
Said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got

[Bridge]
Listen, baby
Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own
Now I'm home

[Verse 3]
My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone
I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

[Hook]
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got

Listen, baby
I bet everything on my wedding ring
I'm giving you the best that I got
Giving it to you, baby

4,Waiting For A Star To Fall,"[Verse 1]
I hear your name whispered on the wind
It's a sound that makes me cry
I hear a song blow again and again
Through my mind and I don't know why
I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
Like happiness and love revolve around you

Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star
So many people love you, baby
That must be what you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
I've learn to feel what I cannot see
But with you, I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in the superstition
I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star
But I can't love you this much, baby
And love you from this far

[Chorus]
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
Waiting (however long)
I don't like waiting (I'll wait for you)
It's so hard waiting (Don't be too long)
Seems like waiting
Makes me love you even more

[Chorus]
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms

5,Two Hearts,"[Verse 1]
You stole my heart bae
If you only knew
How much it breaks my heart
When you say things like ""I hate you""
The sound of it almost gave me a heart attack
I bet if I said I would leave you, you wouldn't even care
If you saw me bawlin' tears, I bet you wouldn't even shed one (not one)
Do you even love me like you say I wonder?
Uh huh, damn that's fucked up
Lord please tell me why I love her
Girl I'll beg you for my heart back
Shouldn't have to go through all that

[Hook]
You'll do fine with just one
Why you gotta be so selfish?
Why you gotta be so selfish?
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna get what's mine back
Never mind that
You don't need two hearts
(You stole my heart, give it back to me)

[Verse 2]
So in love, I can't think straight
Please get the fuck out of my head baby
I wanna take a ride, where will I go?
My favorite places we created memories in those
I know you think my heart is fine but it isn't though
Your love, I need it here, physical
Do I gotta beg you for my heart back?
No, I shouldn't have to go through all that

[Hook]
You'll do fine with just one
Why you gotta be so selfish?
Why you gotta be so selfish?
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna get what's mine back
Never mind that
You don't need two hearts
(You stole my heart, give it back to me)

[Verse 3]
Can I rap to you real quick?
I put what's left of my heart into this track
In hoping you'd feel it, damn
Real shit, it took a while to build this
And you still be talking that bullshit
Even though you not around, ventriloquist
You know better, that's off limits
Leave it alone before you break it
Maybe if you knew better, I might let you
But I know you won't hold it safely
Girl, you do know you got my heart
Please tell me what you need two for
To my health, girl, that's crucial
That's why I say I can't lose... you

You're my everything, everything
You've got something that belongs to me, yea

7,In Your Room,"[Verse 1]

Or will you leave me lying here?
In your favourite darkness

Your favourite consciousness
Your favourite slave

Will I always be here?

8,Walk On Water,"[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan""",Eminem,1988,"[9, 9, 10, 10, 12, 15, 17, 21, 26, 32, 39, 45, 52, 67]",14
9,Don't Rush Me,"[Intro: Jean Grae]
9th, 9th's got them beats that you just sing to for no reason
{*laughs*}
Sometimes you got to get to know yourself
You gotta travel a little bit
Look at yourself from another perspective
So I try to do that
Come on

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
Listen, there's nothing like knowin' yourself
Like the way I know that the smoke has kind of broken my health
Like the way I know my flow don't make appropriate wealth
I can't change that
But, funny I'm sayin' that when it's money I'm aimed at
I give a fuck if you frame that or quote it (shit)
I meant what I said 'cause I wrote it—point noted
I know I'm overly sensitive when it comes to, well
Just about everything
And I'm so hardheaded—I don't need your help
Like no advice for these records 'less it's me and myself
Like, I don't ever want to breathe if it requires assistance
Just, just shut down my system
I'm a victim of choosin' bad love, bad luck Lucy
Every man touched seems to be a doozy and plus
I'm attached to this looseleaf, stand on my two feet
So it's hard enough to even have to physically move me
Go ahead, try

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga (just try)
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me (hey, get your hand off me, man)
Don't rush me (you stupid?  I'll cut you)

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
I gotta be more disciplined
I'm listenin' more to straight logic, blocking random shit that's drifting in
Age is a motherfucker (damn right)
Find myself staring at the little kids, thinking ""I can beat 'em like a stepmother""
Creeping on a come-up at thirty soon
But looking twenty, ooh
The food catches up to you now plenty
Attending christenings of my best friend's children
And then asking who's next
And I'm wishing for six more wishes for Christmas or
Kids on the wish list
Or time machines to be in existence
I'm a team player—not (nope)
The dry wit is similar to Arizona weather.  Say it, nigga—""Hot""
Patent leather sole, tappin' at my bowl
If the album's not platinum, then I'll have to rack a gold
This rappin' ain't for nothin'
Unless I hold plaques so I can sit up on a boat like Colin, roll that
And you know that

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me (hey, didn't I just tell you?)
Don't rush me (fall back, nigga)

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
See, this here is the most serious that I've ever been
The most clear headed
My gear fetish clearly needs an account
So if I need, I'll smoke 'em all like Dennis Leary and I'm out
Beef's great though, thanks for addin' more insecurities
Just as I was findin' my level of maturity
Just as I was mindin' my business, tried to murder Jean's confidence
But lucky for me, you're all incompetent
Road block in this, yes
I see 'em tryna put a stop to my obnoxiousness but
I stay long-winded like sayin', ""George Papadopoulous""
I know but I write from this heart with this
So, I've got some things to work on
My moodiness like masturbation—gets its jerk on
My fascination with the fast pace
The money's encapsulated in my mind space like ""What a thrill""
Past dated and I know I'm not in last place
But it's hard to work through it with this masked face
And masking tape up on the window keeps the cold out
And every time I'm laying down, my back breaks because it's old now
I yell too much, get stressed too quick
But the best thing about it—I can change that shit
And still remain who I came down to Earth to be
It's not Jean Grae—that's just a name, you'll see

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me
Don't rush me

[Outro: Jean Grae]
Please don't make me kill you, I don't want to
I don't need to go to jail right now
I got things to do
Can't be locked up, man
My momma, my momma
No momma.  No, no
Anyway, yo, thanks man
Thank you 9th
And we had a beautiful lunch
Don't be afraid to talk in the back

As if you can forget

It's only been a lifetime
But tonight you're a stranger
Some silhouette

Let's go out in flames so everyone knows who we are
'Cause these city walls never knew that we'd make it this far
We've become echoes, but echoes are fading away
So let's dance like two shadows, burning out a glory day

Strangers in your head

Is not always there

Could I lie to you?

I should make a move
What more can I say?

What more can I say?

[Intro: Joe Budden]
Turn me up in the headphone something
(New Joe Budden)
Look

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
First off let me shout out the fam, y'all so gracious
Been chilling in the room for growth, it's so spacious
Getting to the money, counting these old faces
Like I found the smoking gun in cold cases (nah)
Them dark thoughts never got to 'em still
I'm like the legendary Robin Will
Even though I understand
I never dealt with the pain like that
A knot from that same rope
But I don't hang like that
We had a couple break-ups
Gotta respect Cuzz and I'll hit the reset button
You try to reset Budden, it's real
My accomplishments
Already show 'em how I deal with the consequence
And you can ask Consequence
She reached out via text like ""What up with the guy?""
Which is weird, it's been a year
Since we fraternized
Still I made my way back in her life
Only to prove to myself I wouldn't fuck up twice
We reminiscing, thinking hella back
You had to watch me with her but to hell with that
Cause I think that me carrying that thought
Kind of washed me with her
And even that's cool cause me and you is not me and her
I took a little hiatus, hope you could see the change
I was too high to say this, how could I explain?
Though my mouth was quiet
My mind was like a Ferguson riot
Why it only get worse when I'm in private
Were we victims to the game
Trying to do it over
Here's the gift for an exchange
It's timeout for the public
These niggas won't know a thing
So we keep each other blocked on Twitter
It's not a game
Like a picture in a frame for now
Drunk models, couple Swishers and a stack here

[Hook: Felicia Temple]
Everytime I walk away, you need me
But your words don't mean a thing when you're not here
Tell me is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me is this the way
The way that you care

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
She said she wanna set boundaries
Can't continue to have you surrounding me
Cause that'll lead to you on this couch pounding me
That'll bring them feelings back
That's just out of bounds to me
It's been years, last bitch ain't come around to me
Send my tone of voice down
Like you speaking down to me
Said I said some things to begrudge you
But I can't ask to not be judged then judge you
She said; all this time I've been screaming ""Fuck You""
When she implies I can't move on I'm stuck too
Blood flowing, there's an adrenaline rush too
Every time I'm tryna leave
It's when you're in a rush too
She said; looking back I can see how you was gaming me
Which is fine, I can see how you could feel there
Which means I just gotta ask you one question though
If it was game tell me why them feelings still there?
I know the answer to that: you still fallin'
You ain't never felt so strong, it feels foreign
Probably got me saved in her phone as Phil Collins
Hear it in the air of the night it's still callin'
Every time you see me a couple of bills on him
Got rich then did it again we still ballin'
You ain't gotta respond to that
If you did it would look like it's a con to that
I'm so far beyond of that
Chillin' with a couple of hoes that like hoes
That like niggas that don't act like hoes
I don't say that cause I'm vain
Or some strangers can know I'm the man
We not fucking
Sometimes it's better knowing you can't
She come running back
Every time she throw in the can
Just to holla when she feel like not a soul understand
Baby, I already proved that I ride out
You can't bear to be hurt again so you hide out
You ain't gotta say that, I know you inside out
We communicate so well when all the pride's out
You gotta give it one more go, we ain't tried out
Nah that love wouldn't a been real if it died out

24,When The Children Cry,"[Verse 1:]
Little child dry your crying eyes
How can I explain the fear you feel inside
Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killing man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again

[Chorus:]
When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 2:]
Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

[Chorus]
When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 3:]
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children cry let them know we tried
When the children fight let them know it ain't right
When the children pray let them know the way
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins",White Lion,1988,"[25, 25, 31, 41, 49, 62, 79, 83, 92]",9
25,Born To Be My Baby,"[Verse 1]
Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs because there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

[Chorus]
My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

[Verse 2]
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our fight

[Chorus]
If we stand side by side (all night)
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day that I die
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

[Verse 3]
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan

26,When I'm With You,"[Verse 1]
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
Only you can tell

[Chorus]
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be

27,Little Liar,"[Verse 1]
I was taught to never tell a lie
To look you in the eye and tell it like it is
Always thought that you would be the same
It's such a shame that's not the way it is

I was fooled by your innocence
And my love for you was so intense
With our connection only physical
If it got me through the night
Well that's a lie

[Chorus]
(Hey little liar) I believed in you
(Hey little liar) I believed in you
(Hey little liar) I believed in you oh

[Verse 2]
A simple question makes you look away
Your hesitation gives it all away
There's some protection in the way you move
If there's sadness in my eyes
It's coming from your lies

[Chorus]
(Hey little liar) I believed in you
(Hey little liar) I believed in you
(Hey little liar) I believed in you
I believed in you

[Verse 3]
You want to sleep with me but payback's tough
Why don't you call me when you're all grown up
If there's a change in you I'll know it's true
Hey little liar, I believed in you

[Outro]
(Hey little liar) I believed in you
(Hey little liar) I believed in you
(Hey little liar) I believed in you

28,Holding On,"[Intro: keshi]
Movin' on, never feel the same
Nothin' seems to cover up the pain
Baby, I've been tryin' but you can't hear what I say
Baby, baby-y-y

Baby I’ve been tryin', nothin' seems to cover up the pain
I’ve been tryin', holdin' on, holdin' on
Baby I’ve been tryin', nothin' seems to cover up the pain
I’ve been trying, holdin' on, holdin' on

[Verse: Phora]
Yeah, I’ve just been so numb, it feels like nothing’s real
I’ve just been so empty, I can’t fuckin’ feel
But I can feel my body start to fade
My heart is cold that’s why I’m so sick of taking all these fuckin’ pills
I don’t ever talk about it much
Drinking every day, just to escape the memories of us
You paint me as a villain, but my blood is on your brush
I was in it 'til the end, you was in it for the rush
See I’m scared of being hurt and I’m scared of getting close
'Cause the closest people to you are the ones that hurt you most
But it's hard to know your worth when everything is broke
Now I’m just drownin' in my sorrow tryin' not to fuckin' choke
The more pain you go through, the harder it feel
And the scars that we can’t see are the hardest to heal
I gave you everything, I’m just left with all of these pills
And even though I fuckin' hate you, you have part of me still
Cry for you, I promised that I'd never fuckin' cry for you
Die for you, I can’t be without you, I would die for you
Bleed for you, I do anything, I fuckin' bleed for you
Why can’t you understand? I fuckin' needed you

[Pre-Chorus: keshi]
Movin' on, never feel the same
Nothin' seems to cover up the pain
Baby, I've been tryin' but you can't hear what I say

Baby I’ve been tryin', nothin' seems to cover up the pain
I’ve been tryin', holdin' on, holdin' on

So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another

The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

[Hook]
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing

[Verse 4]
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""

[Outro]
Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby

Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling ""Fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling ""Fuck me""
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass

I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank

So tired I can barely move

No one's at work on time

A few days off in his crazy world
Is something I could use
I'm going -

Back on holiday
Isn't it time we had a vacation?
Back on holiday
Need a little rest and relaxation!

Pick up the phone
Tell the boss I'm not coming in

I'm busy taking it slow
No time to waste in a traffic jam
Morning
Noon and night I think I've paid my dues

Pack my bags and I'm ready to make my getaway
I'm going -

Back on holiday
Isn't it time we had a vacation?...

You know that sometimes life can turn into all work and no play

So if you feel like you need it just go back on holiday

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need

When you take my breath from me (woah)
You are my brightest light
In my darkest dark
You shine right through my doubt
And straight into my heart (oh ohh)

Not just another name

You're not just another girl
Girl (oh)
You're not just another
Girl, girl (oh ohh)
I can't explain myself
You wrap my tongue tied up
The words I wanna say
Couldn't even be enough (woah oh ohh ooh)
I'm falling harder than
I ever thought I could
The things I used to think
Now you've changed for good (woah ooh)
You're not just anybody
Not just another name
No I've never even met someone that's like you before (ohh oh oh ohh)
You're not just another

Right by your side
I'll take on any fear
I know you're scared
But I'll be here
Right by your side
I'll take on any fear
Just you and me
You're not just anybody
Not just another name

49,The Loco-Motion,"[Intro]

Everybody is doin' a brand new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)

My little baby sister can do it with me
It's easier than learning your A B C's
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me

You gotta swing your hips, now
Come on, baby Jump up, jump back
Well, now, I think you've got the knack

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)

Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)

There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me",Little Eva,1988,"[50, 50, 42, 30, 19, 10, 3, 3, 4, 7, 10, 17, 19, 28, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80]",19
50,Angel Of Harlem,"It was a cold and wet December day
When we touched the ground at J.F.K

(Of an angel)

Tonight, this city belongs to me
(Angel)

[Chorus]
Soul love
Well this love won't let me go
So long
Angel of Harlem

Birdland on Fifty-Three
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles says she's got to be an angel
Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies
(Angel)

[Chorus]

Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
Empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee-sting

Blinded, you lost your way
In the side streets and the alleyways
Like a star exploding in the night
Filling up the city with broad daylight

Angel in devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel

57,Kissing A Fool,"You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough
To even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind
'Til you listen to your heart

People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart from you

People
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So goodbye
But please don't take my heart

You are far
I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough
I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind
While I listen to my heart

People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart from you

People
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Ba da da ah ah ah

But remember this
Every other kiss
That you ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you like I always do
There's something there
That can't compare with any other

You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too
Guess you were kissing a fool

You must have been kissing a fool",George Michael,1988,"[58, 58, 37, 16, 9, 5, 7, 9, 15, 22, 28, 34, 47]",13

Been doing it major
Even Walkers ain't got this much flavour
They say I'm super bad like McLovin
Now man are calling me family all of a sudden
And I'm like ""Mum, how come you never told me that I had all these cousins?""
This corner I'm standing in, never felt claustrophobic when I came in 10 minutes ago
Now my backs against the wall
It's a good job I'm tall
So I can always see clear
Even with all the smoke in the air
I know some are standing here cause of loving fame
But a lot of them are here out of fear

It's time to go straight back to the top with them
They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again
And all my real friends know I'm a still keep it 10 multiplied by 10
Forgive me if I've been acting a little strange
I never ever knew that one song could make my whole life change
Last week I boarded six planes
But I can't complain, this is the moment I've been waiting for
Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door
I'm with Boy Better Know let them all in
But there's a flip side to all things
So before you sign yourself up to the high life
Make sure you read the small print
Please
Listen to me when I'm talking
The guy you're looking at right now is the guy I was this morning
I never had a pen but I made a mark
Even when I top the chart, I'll be the same guy that I was at the start
I hope to die I cross my heart

63,"Hippy Hippy Shake (From ""Cocktail"")","There are only fragments of me left now. Chunks of memory have broken free and drifted away like calved glaciers. It is always  like that when a Passenger leaves us. We can never be sure of all the things our borrowed bodies did. We have only the lingering traces,  the imprints.

Like sand clinging to an ocean-tossed bottle. Like the throbbings of amputated legs.

I rise. I collect myself. My hair is rumpled; I comb it. My face is creased from too little sleep. There is sourness in my mouth. Has my Passenger been eating dung with my mouth? They do that. They do anything.

It is morning.

A gray, uncertain morning. I stare at it awhile, and then, shuddering, I opaque the window and confront instead the gray, uncertain surface of the inner panel. My room looks untidy. Did I have a woman here? There are ashes in the trays. Searching for butts, I find several with lipstick stains. Yes, a woman was here.

I touched the bedsheets. Still warm with shared warmth. Both  pillows tousled. She has gone, though, and the Passenger is gone, and I am alone.

How long did it last, this time?

I pick up the phone and ring Central. “What is the date?”

The computer’s bland feminine voice replies, “Friday, December fourth, nineteen eighty-seven.”

“The time?”

“Nine fifty-one, Eastern Standard Time.”

“The weather forecast?”

“Predicted temperature range for today thirty to thirty-eight. Current temperature, thirty-one. Wind from the north, sixteen miles an hour. Chances of precipitation slight.”

“What do you recommend for a hangover?”

“Food or medication?”

“Anything you like,” I say.

The computer mulls that one over for a while. Then it decides on both, and activates my kitchen. The spigot yields cold tomato juice. Eggs begin to fry. From the medicine slot comes a purplish liquid. The Central Computer is always so thoughtful. Do the Passengers ever ride it, I wonder? What thrills could that hold for them? Surely it must be more exciting to borrow the million minds of Central than to live awhile in the short-circuited soul of a corroding human being!

December fourth, Central said. Friday. So the Passenger had me for three nights.

I drink the purplish stuff and probe my memories in a gingerly way, as one might probe a festering sore.

I remember Tuesday morning. A bad time at work. None of the charts will come out right. The section manager irritable; he has been taken by Passengers three times in five weeks, and his section is in disarray as a result, and his Christmas bonus is jeopardized. Even though it is customary not to penalize a person for lapses due to Passengers, according to the system, the section manager seems to feel he will be treated unfairly. So he treats us unfairly. We have a hard time. Revise the charts, fiddle with the program, check the fundamentals ten times over. Out they come: the detailed forecasts for price variations of public utility securities, February-April 1988. That afternoon we are to meet and discuss the charts and what they tell us.

I do not remember Tuesday afternoon.

That must have been when the Passenger took me. Perhaps at work; perhaps in the mahogany-paneled boardroom itself, during the conference. Pink concerned faces all about me; I cough, I lurch, I stumble from my seat. They shake their heads sadly. No one reaches for me. No one stops me. It is too dangerous to interfere with one who has a Passenger. The chances are great that a second Passenger lurks nearby in the discorporate state, looking for a mount. So I am avoided. I leave the building.

After that, what?

Sitting in my room on bleak Friday morning, I eat my scrambled eggs and try to reconstruct the three lost nights.

Of course it is impossible. The conscious mind functions during the period of captivity, but upon withdrawal of the Passenger nearly every recollection goes too. There is only a slight residue, a gritty film of faint and ghostly memories. The mount is never precisely the same person afterwards; though he cannot recall the details of his experience, he is subtly changed by it.

I try to recall.

A girl? Yes: lipstick on the butts. Sex, then, here in my room. Young? Old? Blonde? Dark? Everything is hazy. How did my borrowed body behave? Was I a good lover? I try to be, when I am myself. I keep in shape. At thirty-eight, I can handle three sets of tennis on a summer afternoon without collapsing. I can make a woman glow as a woman is meant to glow. Not boasting; just categorizing. We have our skills. These are mine.

But Passengers, I am told, take wry amusement in controverting our skills. So would it have given my rider a kind of delight to find me a woman and force me to fail repeatedly with her?

I dislike that thought.

The fog is going from my mind now. The medicine prescribed by Central works rapidly. I eat, I shave, I stand under the vibrator until my skin is clean. I do my exercises. Did the Passenger exercise my body Wednesday and Thursday mornings? Probably not. I must make up for that. I am close to middle age, now; tonus lost is not easily regained.

I touch my toes twenty times, knees stiff.

I kick my legs in the air.

I lie flat and lift myself on pumping elbows.

The body responds, maltreated though it has been. It is the first bright moment of my awakening: to feel the inner tingling, to know that I still have vigor.

Fresh air is what I want next. Quickly I slip into my clothes and leave. There is no need for me to report to work today. They are aware that since Tuesday afternoon I have had a Passenger; they need not be aware that before dawn on Friday the Passenger departed. I will have a free day. I will walk the city’s streets, stretching my limbs, repaying my body for the abuse it has suffered.

I enter the elevator. I drop fifty stories to the ground. I step out into the December dreariness.

The towers of New York rise about me.

In the street the cars stream forward. Drivers sit edgily at their wheels. One never knows when the driver of a nearby car will be borrowed, and there is always a moment of lapsed coordination as the Passenger takes over. Many lives are lost that way on our streets and highways; but never the life of a Passenger.

I begin to walk without purpose. I cross Fourteenth Street, heading north, listening to the soft violet purr of the electric engines. I see a  boy jigging in the street and know he is being ridden. At Fifth and Twenty-second a prosperous-looking paunchy man approaches, his necktie askew, this morning’s Wall Street Journal jutting from an overcoat pocket. He giggles. He thrusts out his tongue. Ridden. Ridden. I avoid him. Moving briskly, I come to the underpass that carries traffic below Thirty-fourth Street toward Queens, and pause for a moment to watch two adolescent girls quarreling at the rim of the pedestrian walk. One is a Negro. Her eyes are rolling in terror. The other pushes her closer to the railing. Ridden. But the Passenger does not have murder on its mind, merely pleasure. The Negro girl is released and falls in a huddled heap, trembling. Then she rises and runs. The other girl draws a long strand of gleaming hair into her mouth, chews on it, seems to awaken. She looks dazed.

I avert my eyes. One does not watch while a fellow sufferer is awakening. There is a morality of the ridden; we have so many new tribal mores in these dark days.

I hurry on.

Where am I going so hurriedly? Already I have walked more than a mile. I seem to be moving toward some goal, as though my Passenger still hunches in my skull, urging me about. But I know that is not so. For the moment, at least, I am free.

Can I be sure of that?

Cogito ergo sum no longer applies. We go on thinking even while we are ridden, and we live in quiet desperation, unable to half halt our courses no matter how ghastly, no matter how self-destructive. I am certain that I can distinguish between the condition of bearing a Passenger and the condition of being free. But perhaps not. Perhaps I bear a particularly devilish Passenger which has not quitted me at all, but which merely has receded to the cerebellum, leaving me the illusion of freedom while all the time surreptitiously driving me onward to some purpose of its own.

Did we ever have more than that: the illusion of freedom?

But this is disturbing, the thought that I may be ridden without realizing it. I burst out in heavy perspiration, not merely from the exertion of walking. Stop. Stop here. Why must you walk? You are at Forty-second Street. There is the library. Nothing forces you onward. Stop a while, I tell myself. Rest on the library steps.

I sit on the cold stone and tell myself that I have made this decision for myself.

Have I? It is the old problem, free will versus determinism, translated into the foulest of forms. Determinism is no longer a philosopher’s abstraction; it is cold alien tendrils sliding between the cranial sutures. The Passengers arrived three years ago. I have been ridden five times since then. Our world is quite different now. But we have adjusted even to this. We have adjusted. We have our mores. Life goes on. Our governments rule, our legislatures meet, our stock exchanges transact business as usual, and we have methods for compensating for the random havoc. It is the only way. What else can we do? Shrivel in defeat? We have an enemy we cannot fight; at best we can resist through endurance. So we endure.

The stone steps are cold against my body. In December few people sit here.

I tell myself that I made this long walk of my own free will, that I halted of my own free will, that no Passenger rides my brain now. Perhaps. Perhaps. I cannot let myself believe that I am not free.

Can it be, I wonder, that the Passenger left some lingering command in me? Walk to this place, halt at this place? That is possible too.

I look about me at the others on the library steps.

An old man, eyes vacant, sitting on newspaper. A boy of thirteen or so with flaring nostrils. A plump woman. Are all of them ridden? Passengers seem to cluster about me today. The more I study the ridden ones, the more convinced I become that I am, for the moment, free. The last time, I had three months of freedom between rides. Some people, they say, are scarcely ever free. Their bodies are in great demand, and they know only scattered bursts of freedom, a day here, a week there, an hour. We have never been able to determine how many Passengers infest our world. Millions, maybe. Or maybe five. Who can tell?

A wisp of snow curls down out of the gray sky. Central had said the chance of precipitation was slight. Are they riding Central this morning too?

I see the girl.

She sits diagonally across from me, five steps up and a hundred feet away, her black skirt pulled up on her knees to reveal handsome legs. She is young. Her hair is deep, rich auburn. Her eyes are pale; at this distance, I cannot make out the precise color. She is dressed simply. She is younger than thirty. She wears a dark green coat and her lipstick has a purplish tinge. Her lips are full, her nose slender, high-bridged, her eyebrows carefully plucked.

I know her.

I have spent the past three nights with her in my room. She is the one. Ridden, she came to me, and ridden, I slept with her. I am certain of this. The veil of memory opens; I see her slim body naked on my bed.

How can it be that I remember this?

It is too strong to be an illusion. Clearly this is something that I have been permitted to remember for reasons I cannot comprehend. And I remember more. I remember her soft gasping sounds of pleasure. I know that my own body did not betray me those three nights, nor did I fail her need.

And there is more. A memory of sinuous music; a scent of youth in her hair; the rustle of winter trees. Somehow she brings back to me a time of innocence, a time when I am young and girls are mysterious, a time of parties and dances and warmth and secrets.

I am drawn to her now.

There is an etiquette about such things, too. It is in poor taste to approach someone you have met while being ridden. Such an encounter gives you no privilege; a stranger remains a stranger, no matter what you and she may have done and said during your involuntary time together.

Yet I am drawn to her.

Why this violation of taboo? Why this raw breach of etiquette? I have never done this before. I have been scrupulous.

But I get to my feet and walk along the step on which I have been sitting, until I am below her, and I look up, and automatically she folds her ankles together and angles her knees as if in awareness that her position is not a modest one. I know from that gesture that she is not ridden now. My eyes meet hers. Her eyes are hazy green. She is beautiful, and I rack my memory for more details of our passion.

I climb step by step until I stand before her.

“Hello,” I say.

She gives me a neutral look. She does not seem to recognize me. Her eyes are veiled, as one’s eyes often are, just after the Passenger has gone. She purses her lips and appraises me in a distant way.

“Hello,” she replies coolly. “I don’t think I know you.”

“No. You don’t. But I have the feeling you don’t want to be alone just now. And I know I don’t.” I try to persuade her with my eyes that my motives are decent. “There’s snow in the air,” I say. “We can find a warmer place. I’d like to talk to you.”

“About what?”

“Let’s go elsewhere , and I’ll tell you. I’m Charles Roth.”

“Helen Martin.”

She gets to her feet. She still has not cast aside her cool neutrality; she is suspicious, ill at ease. But at least she is willing to go with me. A good sign.

“Is it too early in the day for a drink?” I ask.

“I’m not sure. I hardly know what time it is.”

“Before noon.”

“Let’s have a drink anyway,” she says, and we both smile.

We go to a cocktail lounge across the street. Sitting face to face in the darkness, we sip drinks, daiquiri for her, bloody mary for me. She relaxes a little. I ask myself what it is I want from her. The pleasure of her company, yes. Her company in bed? But I have already had that pleasure, three nights of it, though she does not know that. I want something more. Something more. What?

Her eyes are bloodshot. She has had little sleep these past three nights.

I say, “Was it very unpleasant for you?”

“What?”

“The Passenger.”

A whiplash of reaction crosses her face. “How did you know I’ve had a Passenger?”

“I know.”

“We aren’t supposed to talk about it.”

“I’m broadminded,” I tell her. `My Passenger left me some time during the night. I was ridden since Tuesday afternoon.”

“Mine left me about two hours ago, I think.” Her cheeks color. She is doing something daring, talking like this. “I was ridden since Monday night.”

We toy with our drinks. Rapport is growing, almost without the need of words. Our recent experiences with Passengers give us something in common, although Helen does not realize how intimately we shared those experiences.

We talk. She is a designer of display windows. She has a small apartment several blocks from here. She lives alone. She asks me what I do. “Securities analyst,” I tell her. She smiles. Her teeth are flawless. We have a second round of drinks. I am positive, now, that this is the girl who was in my room while I was ridden.

A seed of hope grows in me. It was a happy chance that brought us together again, so soon after we parted as dreamers. A happy chance, too, that some vestige of the dream lingered in my mind.

We have shared something, who knows what, and it must have been good to leave such a vivid imprint on me, and now I want to come to her conscious, aware, my own master, and renew that relationship, making it a real one this time. It is not proper, for I am trespassing on a privilege that is not mine except by virtue of our Passengers’ brief presence in us. Yet I need her. I want her.

She seems to need me, too, without realizing who I am. But fear holds her back.

I am frightened of frightening her, and I do not try to press my advantage too quickly. Perhaps she would take me to her apartment with her now, perhaps not, but I do not ask. We finish our drinks. We arrange to meet by the library steps again tomorrow. My hand momentarily brushes hers. Then she is gone.

I fill three ashtrays that night. Over and over I debate the wisdom of what I am doing. But why not leave her alone? I have no right to follow her. In the place our world has become, we are wisest to remain apart.

And yet— there is that stab of half-memory when I think of her. The blurred lights of lost chances behind the stairs, of girlish laughter in second-floor corridors, of stolen kisses, of tea and cake. I remember the girl with the orchid in her hair, and the one in the spangled dress, and the one with the child’s face and the woman’s eyes, all so long ago, all lost, all gone, and I tell myself that this one I will not lose, I will not permit her to be taken from me.

Morning comes, a quiet Saturday. I return to the library, hardly expecting to find her there, but she is there, on the steps, and the sight of her is like a reprieve. She looks wary, troubled; obviously she has done much thinking, little sleeping. Together we walk along Fifth Avenue. She is quite close to me, but she does not take my arm. Her steps are brisk, short, nervous.

I want to suggest that we go to her apartment instead of to the cocktail lounge. In these days we must move swiftly while we are free. But I know it would be a mistake to think of this as a matter of tactics. Coarse haste would be fatal, bringing me perhaps an ordinary victory, a numbing defeat within it. In any event her mood hardly seems promising. I look at her, thinking of string music and new snowfalls, and she looks toward the gray sky.

She says, “I can feel them watching me all the time. Like vultures swooping overhead, waiting, waiting. Ready to pounce.”

“But there’s a way of beating them. We can grab little scraps of life when they’re not looking.”

“They’re always looking.”

“No,” I tell her. “There can’t be enough of them for that. Sometimes they’re looking the other way. And while they are, two people can come together and try to share warmth.”

“But what’s the use?”

“You’re too pessimistic, Helen. They ignore us for months at a time. We have a chance. We have a chance.”

But I cannot break through her shell of fear. She is paralyzed by the nearness of the Passengers, unwilling to begin anything for fear it will be snatched away by our tormentors. We reach the building where she lives, and I hope she will relent and invite me in. For an instant she wavers, but only for an instant: she takes my hand in both of hers, and smiles, and the smile fades, and she is gone, leaving me only with the words, “Let’s meet at the library again tomorrow. Noon.”

I make the long chilling walk home alone.

Some of her pessimism seeps into me that night. It seems futile for us to try to salvage anything. More than that: wicked for me to seek her out, shameful to offer a hesitant love when I am not free. In this world, I tell myself, we should keep well clear of others, so that we do not harm anyone when we are seized and ridden.

I do not go to meet her in the morning.

It is best this way, I insist. I have no business trifling with her. I imagine her at the library, wondering why I am late, growing tense, impatient, then annoyed. She will be angry with me for breaking our date, but her anger will ebb, and she will forget me quickly enough.

Monday comes. I return to work.

Naturally, no one discusses my absence. It is as though I have never been away. The market is strong that morning. The work is challenging; it is mid-morning before I think of Helen at all. But once I think of her, I can think of nothing else. My cowardice in standing her up. The childishness of Saturday night’s dark thoughts. Why accept fate so passively? Why give in? I want to fight, now, to carve out a pocket of security despite the odds. I feel a deep conviction that it can be done. The Passengers may never bother the two of us again, after all. And that flickering smile of hers outside her building Saturday, that momentary glow—it should have told me that behind her wall of fear she felt the same hopes. She was waiting for me to lead the way. And I stayed home instead.

At lunchtime I go to the library, convinced it is futile.

But she is there. She paces along the steps; the wind slices at her slender figure. I go to her.

She is silent a moment. “Hello,” she says finally.

“I’m sorry about yesterday.”

“I waited a long time for you.”

I shrug. “I made up my mind that it was no use to come. But then I changed my mind again.”

She tries to look angry. But I know she is pleased to see me again—else why did she come here today? She cannot hide her inner pleasure. Nor can I. I point across the street to the cocktail lounge.

“A daiquiri?” I say. “As a peace offering?”

“All right.”

Today the lounge is crowded, but we find a booth somehow. There is a brightness in her eyes that I have not seen before. I sense that a barrier is crumbling within her.

“You’re less afraid of me, Helen,” I say.

“I’ve never been afraid of you. I’m afraid of what could happen if we take the risks.”

“Don’t be. Don’t be.”

“I’m trying not to be afraid. But sometimes it seems so hopeless. Since they came here—”

“We can still try to live our own lives.”

“Maybe.”

“We have to. Let’s make a pact, Helen. No more gloom. No more worrying about the terrible things that might just happen. All right?”

A pause. Then a cool hand against mine.

“All right.”

We finish our drinks, and I present my Credit Central to pay for them, and we go outside. I want her to tell me to forget about this afternoon’s work and come home with her. It is inevitable, now, that she will ask me, and better sooner than later.

We walk a block. She does not offer the invitation. I sense the struggle inside her, and I wait, letting that struggle reach its own resolution without interference from me. We walk a second block. Her arm is through mine, but she talks only of her work, of the weather, and it is a remote, arm’s-length conversation. At the next corner she swings around, away from her apartment, back toward the cocktail lounge. I try to be patient with her.

I have no need to rush things now, I tell myself. Her body is not a secret to me. We have begun our relationship topsy-turvy, with the physical part first; now it will take time to work backward to the more difficult part that some people call love.

But of course she is not aware that we have known each other that way. The wind blows swirling snowflakes in our faces, and somehow the cold sting awakens honesty in me. I know what I must say. I must relinquish my unfair advantage.

I tell her, “While I was ridden last week, Helen, I had a girl in my room.”

“Why talk of such things now?”

“I have to, Helen. You were the girl.”

She halts. She turns to me. People hurry past us in the street. Her face is very pale, with dark red spots growing in her cheeks.

“That’s not funny, Charles.”

“It wasn’t meant to be. You were with me from Tuesday night to early Friday morning.”

“How can you possibly know that?”

“I do. I do. The memory is clear. Somehow it remains, Helen. I see your whole body.”

“Stop it, Charles.”

“We were very good together,” I say. “We must have pleased our Passengers because we were so good. To see you again—it was like waking from a dream, and finding that the dream was real, the girl right there—”

“No!”

“Let’s go to your apartment and begin again.”

She says, “You’re being deliberately filthy, and I don’t know why, but there wasn’t any reason for you to spoil things. Maybe I was with you and maybe I wasn’t, but you wouldn’t know it, and if you did know it you should keep your mouth shut about it, and—”

“You have a birthmark the size of a dime,” I say, “about two inches below your left breast.”

She sobs and hurls herself at me, there in the street. Her long silvery nails rake my cheeks. She pummels me. I seize her. Her knees assail me. No one pays attention; those who pass by assume we are ridden, and turn their heads. She is all fury, but I have my arms around hers like metal bands, so that she can only stamp and snort, and her body is close against mine. She is rigid, anguished.

In a low, urgent voice I say, “We’ll defeat them, Helen. We’ll finish what they started. Don’t fight me. There’s no reason to fight me. I know, it’s a fluke that I remember you, but let me go with you and I’ll prove that we belong together.”

“Let—go—”

“Please. Please. Why should we be enemies? I don’t mean you any harm. I love you, Helen. Do you remember, when we were kids, we could play at being in love? I did; you must have done it too. Sixteen, seventeen years old. The whispers, the conspiracies—all a big game, and we knew it. But the game’s over. We can’t afford to tease and run. We have so little time, when we’re free—we have to trust, to open ourselves—”

“It’s wrong.”

“No. Just because it’s the stupid custom for two people brought together by Passengers to avoid one another, that doesn’t mean we have to follow it. Helen—Helen—”

Something in my tone registers with her. She ceases to struggle. Her rigid body softens. She looks up at me, her tearstreaked face thawing, her eyes blurred.

“Trust me,” I say. “Trust me, Helen!”

She hesitates. Then she smiles.







In that moment I feel the chill at the back of my skull, the sensation as of a steel needle driven deep through bone. I stiffen. My arms drop away from her. For an instant, I lose touch, and when the mists clear all is different.

“Charles?” she says. “Charles?”

Her knuckles are against her teeth. I turn, ignoring her, and go back into the cocktail lounge. A young man sits in one of the front booths. His dark hair gleams with pomade; his cheeks are smooth. His eyes meet mine.

I sit down. He orders drinks. We do not talk.

My hand falls on his wrist, and remains there. The bartender, serving the drinks, scowls but says nothing. We sip our cocktails and put the drained glasses down.

“Let’s go,” the young man says.

68,Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble,"[Intro: Fresh Prince]
Listen homeboys don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Verse One]
Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said: ""You're kind of cute"" I said: ""Yes, I know, but...
By the way, sweetheart, what's your name?""
She said: ""My friends like to call me exotic Elaine""
I said: ""My name is the Prince"" and she said: ""Why?""
I said: ""Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!
But enough about me, yo, let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do""
I popped some trash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me 'did I like her?' I said: ""Well... kinda""
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said: ""You better stop buggin'!""
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: ""Rape!""
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with aggravated assault
(Yo Clancy we got him) but it wasn't my fault!

[Chorus: Fresh Prince]
Nevertheless don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Verse Two]
I was in a bar one Friday night
Cooling watching a Mike Tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on tequila
When this girl walked up she said: ""Hi, my name is Sheila""
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said: ""Let's go""
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said: ""I'm with you, toots""
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said: ""Oh, your hands are cold!""
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said: ""Baby, where are you?""
Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin
And said: ""Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb!""
I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?
I just yelled: ""Geronimo!"" and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done, sneezing and coughing...
I hope this doesn't happen too often, but

[Chorus: The Fresh Prince]
Nevertheless don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Spoken interlude]
[Jazzy] Yo man you think they see your point?
[Prince] I don't know, I don't think they really do...
[Jazzy] I think you should give 'em another example
[Prince] Awright, give me a scratch let's make it funky right here

[Verse Three]
I got a ring on my phone May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty I said: ""Hello dear!
I was just about to call you
I got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert"" (I'm wit it)
""It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready?"" (Yeah)
""Aight, fine, see you then, Betty""
I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif
Got to Betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mom said: ""Betty's not ready yet""
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said: ""I need a little longer to finish my hair""
At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!?
""Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!""
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home

[Outro: Fresh Prince]
But it just goes to show not trying to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme
Just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

[Outro]
[Jazzy] Man, first your parents just don't understand...
[Jazzy] Then you have these crazy nightmares...

70,Edge Of A Broken Heart,"[Verse 1]
And there I stood just like a soldier
I was tough until I saw her
I said hello but she just turned away
Hey Romeo, what are you doing with my girl?
Who are you using now? I turn and walk away
I'm going to please her
Now you can believe it
I'll be there to catch her when she falls

[Chorus]
Here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm a man (on the edge of a broken heart)
Here we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)
So run if you can because you know
I'm a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)

[Verse 2]
I'm on the outside, looking inside
You're with him, whose on the wrong side now?
Do you still think of me?
I've tried to call but no one answers
Two silhouettes, a private dancer
The lights go dim as the music starts to fade away
I'm the one who needs you
Now you can believe it
I'll be there to catch you when you fall

[Chorus]
You better believe I'm a man (on the edge of a broken heart)
Here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)
And we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)
So run if you can because you know
I'm a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)

And when I hold out my hands
I'll be reaching for you
I give it all that I've got
That's all I can do
When you're waiting for love
I'll be waiting for you

71,"Don't Worry, Be Happy (From ""Cocktail"")","I’m pretty sure I have everything organised for the family before I walk out the door.

    Kids’ bags packed.

    Extra food prepared.

    Outdoor gear organised.

    Jordan and Elizabeth are going on their first wilderness expedition for a week with all the dads charged with helping out given the nature of outdoor activities they will be pursuing. Great idea from a mother’s perspective, but we all know in our hearts we will miss them from the first night they are away. The kids were devastated when the expedition was almost cancelled due to a lack of funding and support for the Tasmanian Wilderness Foundation. Thankfully, some last-minute sponsorship from the Fathers4Kids program enabled the expedition to take place after all. The kids are so excited. Actually when I think about it Robert, my husband, seems more awakened and engaged by this adventure than I have seen him in years. Must have something to do with men and their exploring tendencies — the mysteriousness of the confounding thylacine providing the perfect avenue — or maybe he is just happy to be away from me. Either way, he’s excited too and they haven’t been able to sleep in anticipation of the great adventure traversing the west coast of Tasmania’s wilderness in search of the elusive Tasmanian tiger.

    I’ve decided to make the most of the children’s absence from my life to complete a series of lectures I had been deferring for the last few months until the ‘time felt right’, so I’m preparing to fly to Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne to deliver my latest findings to postgraduate students, academics and other professionals in their given field of expertise.

    I now really need to focus on getting myself organised for the first lecture this afternoon in Sydney. Mentally, I go through my checklist — I have my notes, slides, discussion themes, workshop challenges, laptop and mobile phone, so all good. I am still fascinated by the research I have been conducting on visual stimulation and its impact on the development of perception and even now I find my mind wandering off and becoming lost in my work, considering a different spin on some of the provocative challenges I have developed for the lectures …

    All of a sudden, I become intensely aware of butterflies in my stomach, so much so, I have to lean against the kitchen bench to steady myself. I never usually get nervous before giving lectures, quite the opposite, as I really enjoy it. The challenge of engaging new minds, intellects sparring with one another on a quest for deeper, broader knowledge — fantastic! But where on earth are these butterflies coming from?

    I pause for a moment to investigate these feelings and attempt to locate their source, which might seem strange to some people, but it is something that has always intrigued me. They are more intense than usual, and it certainly isn’t the lecture making me feel this way. Perhaps it is the trip away from family. No, it is not as if I haven’t been away from them before, particularly for work purposes. I broaden my mindset to include the rest of the weekend when I stop suddenly — as my stomach flips again. I surprise myself as I instinctively inhale at the thought of my 5.00 p.m. meeting at the Hotel InterContinental with Jeremy.

    Doctor Jeremy Quinn. My uni buddy, my best friend, the man who opened my eyes and my body to the world in ways I never considered possible. He knew me inside and out when we were younger and we shared an incredible array of experiences during our time together. It is hard to believe after all of our tomfoolery during many years at university, that Jeremy is now one of the most respected, pre-eminent medical research doctors in Australasia — I can’t bring myself to say ‘the world’ because it’s Jeremy, after all. He has just returned from presenting ground-breaking research at Harvard University with Emeritus Professor E. Applegate.

    Jeremy always had a knack for pushing conventional boundaries and wisdom, continually searching for the unknown, the unexpected or unanticipated solutions to some of our most insurmountable medical problems. I even read in a newspaper article recently that he had been in meetings with none other than Melinda and Bill Gates in conjunction with his and Professor Applegate’s research in New York. It seems as if he is certainly mixing it with the global movers and shakers. I suppose, on reflection, he always had the determination and potential to achieve mastery in his chosen field. It is amazing what he has achieved in less than forty years of life. He is an exceptionally gifted human being, intellectually and emotionally, and people just adore his company. No doubt all these traits, along with his hard work, have enabled the success he is now hopefully enjoying.

    My career needs to fit in with my family life, well, the kids really; Jeremy’s career is his life, more or less. He has always been tenacious about his quest for sourcing medical cures and has been involved in discoveries that the western world almost takes for granted these days. With that sort of personal motivation and drive, it’s not surprising he hasn’t had time to settle down or find anyone special to share his life with. At least I’m not aware of anyone. He has always attracted interest from the opposite sex, like a George Clooney of the medical world; he certainly doesn’t suffer from lack of attention.

    Anyway, that’s what is making my stomach do flips, which is utterly ridiculous at my age. I allow myself a small smile as I find it mildly amusing I am still capable of that sort of fluttering teenage reaction. I am excited and a little nervous about seeing him after so long. The memories of our university days still flood my mind and haunt me whenever I’m alone and in a dark sensual mood, usually in the early hours of the morning …

    What is happening to me? I’m going to miss the plane if I don’t get moving!

    ‘Right, kids? Where are you? I need kisses and cuddles before I leave — I won’t see you for ten whole days!’ Big family hugs all round. I tell them I love them more than life itself and wish them a fabulous adventure in the wild west as they endeavour to track that elusive tiger; apparently legend has it there have been recent sightings. No doubt a camp of school kids is just what they need to be discovered again! However, the kids’ excitement and optimism filters through regardless.

    ‘And keep safe,’ I declare, promising that I can’t wait to hear every detail of their experience when I return.

    I hear the honk of a horn indicating my taxi’s arrival and do my last-minute check to ensure I have everything I need. I am thankful the butterflies have finally subsided. My lips barely touch my husband’s cheek as I tell him to take excellent care of my children and ensure he keeps them safe. A fleeting thought passes through my brain wondering when our relationship became so plastic, so platonic … I have too many things on my mind to delve further and quickly wish them all a wonderful adventure as he dutifully places my bag in the car and I wave goodbye, blowing kisses to the kids from my window as the taxi pulls out of the drive, airport bound.

                                               ***

    Focus, focus, focus! I keep saying to myself to little avail. My mind is in a state of complete distraction today, which is highly unusual. I hear the captain speaking, good weather, clear flight path, not expecting any delays. Flight attendants are telling me to put my seat belt on and tray up for take-off as they do every flight. It’s not like I don’t know that for goodness’ sake, I think, my irritation surprising me. But of course, I do what I’m told expeditiously as I don’t want to cause a scene. I reluctantly put my notes away and close my eyes momentarily as the plane slowly manoeuvres toward the runway. I feel my chest rising and falling lightly with each breath. Jeremy’s face flashes through my mind, his gorgeous cheeky smile and smoky green, seemingly bottomless eyes … his lips gently kissing my neck … his fingers lightly caressing my nipples … then teasing them to life …

    What am I doing? I force my mind to a screeching stop. This is absurd. I force myself back to the here and now and suddenly notice we are in the air and the seat belt sign is off. I breathe a sigh of relief. Now, back to my lecture. I talk myself into believing I am disciplined enough not to let my mind wander off for another second.

    I am good at being disciplined, I tell myself. I run an organised house, career and life overall. I love my family and my work and have studied long and hard to achieve what I have. Dr Alexandra Blake. I work between the business world and academia given my studies in both commerce and psychology. This combination has worked well for me financially and I am forever grateful that I am one of the lucky people in life who love their work and are passionate about what they do. Enough of self-talk and affirmations … I need to think about the presentation today.

    Once again, I ponder the topic of the lecture which I will be delivering to approximately 500 people in just a few hours’ time. This fact finally snaps my mind to attention. I consider using some additional questions and challenges to open discussion and promote their thinking. I like the idea so I note down the following points on my notepad to use for the end of the session.

        *    How important is visual perception to your mindset?

        *    How much do you depend on visual stimulation to               interpret your world?

        *    What senses do you believe would most compensate for a               lack of visual perception? Why? How?

Given research shows that body language — a visual sense — accounts for more than 90 per cent of communication between people, the significance of these sorts of questions becomes exponential.

    I’m feeling much calmer now that I am once again absorbed in my work. The rest of the flight goes smoothly and I arrive on time at the University of Sydney.

                                               ***

    ‘Dr Blake, good morning, great to have you back.’

    I look ahead and smile toward my PhD examiner, Samuel Webster. ‘Well, good morning to you too, Professor; it’s great to be back.’

    ‘You know you are always welcome, Alexandra. It’s been too long. It seems to be very difficult to draw you away from the south isle.’

    ‘Hmm, on reflection, it’s been a while. I guess time flies when you are having fun.’

    ‘I’m glad to hear it. You have certainly been busy on the research front. We’re looking forward to your lecture this afternoon.’

    ‘And as ever, I’m looking forward to hearing your insights and expertise. Thank you so much for your support in bringing this together.’

    ‘My pleasure, my dear, my pleasure. Do you have time for a quick lunch with some colleagues before you take centre stage?’

    ‘For you, Samuel, always.’ I smile again warmly as he leads me along the manicured lawns beside the beautiful, historic buildings. It feels good to be back.

    At lunch with Samuel, I reflect on what an honour it was to have him oversee my PhD. He specialises in defensive (passive and aggressive) behaviours in the workforce and was instrumental in developing my thesis. His global connections both in the corporate world and academia are second to none and his knowledge is immense. He’s recently been working hand in hand with the Brain and Mind Research Institute, which enables him to analyse many of his revolutionary hypotheses about behaviour and sexuality in the field of neuroscience. I find his work truly fascinating and being with him today allows me to see how passionate and absorbed he has become in this branch of his research.

    I find myself reflecting just how much of an impact Samuel has had on my career. The support and the sage advice when it all became too hard, made me feel obliged to hang in there for both him and the future rewards.He drives his PhD students hard and wants no stone left unturned. I smile internally at those years of insanity and frustration, pleased I completed them and relieved they are behind me.

    Samuel had offered me a senior lecturing position at Sydney University and was not happy when I turned it down for a similar role at the University of Tasmania. He taught me so much, I felt indebted to him, but he understood my reasons, that it was a lifestyle choice, particularly with a young family in tow. He promised he would stay in touch and support me both professionally and personally, and he has definitely been a man of his word. Samuel was instrumental in getting my research on visual perception off the ground and more recently became my chief academic sponsor, which is how I come to be presenting this lecture series today.

    I’m touched that he has taken the time to introduce me to his team of, in his words, ‘elite researchers’, who appear to be hanging on his every word. I suppose I looked the same way when I was a new postgrad. Brad, Max, Denise and Elijah, all of whom are doing fascinating work within the world of psychology and neuroscience. It makes me feel alive, interacting with kindred folk again. It certainly isn’t the type of discussion for the average dinner party. Very quickly the specifics of their research unfold and it would be remiss of me not to say I’m more than a little astounded by the path that follows. Given the calibre of people engaging in the impassioned discussion, the comments fly around the table almost too fast for me to assimilate.

    ‘Even the source of the female orgasm is still to be scientifically determined, unlike the male orgasm which has been extensively funded, researched scientifically and agreed medically.’

    ‘Basically, medical science continually refuses to acknowledge the physical reality of the female ejaculation and unfortunately it is not a priority. Lack of funding has impacted the ability to provide coherent education on the study of women’s sexual behaviours. We are hoping to change that.’

    ‘Even today, there is a notable disconnect between medicine and science in relation to the female orgasm, to the extent that the primary understanding of female ejaculation is still urinary stress incontinence.’

    ‘Did you realise that no one has been able to medically agree on the source of the orgasm, whether it be uterine, clitoral, vaginal, vulval or a blend of any of these combinations? Even though this concept of the female orgasm has been recorded in literature throughout history?’

    ‘The main problem being a distinct lack of participants able to generate orgasmic fluid in a clinical environment.’

    ‘Nobody can agree on the most effective way to generate the female orgasm which in effect makes sourcing it extremely difficult.’

    ‘The physical, emotional, hormonal and environmental states of the female all seem to play a significant role, but at this stage it is impossible to determine whether one plays a greater or lesser role than the other.

    The hypotheses are many and varied so we are now conducting more research on the neurological connections to help develop our theories further.’

    My mind at this point envisions rows of women wearing white robes all lined up in hospital beds with legs spread open attempting to generate an orgasm to be captured in a test tube.

    I quickly shake my head to dislodge the disturbing image penetrating my brain. I notice I have barely touched my lunch; I’m so caught up in the flow of the discussion.

    Samuel eventually concludes: ‘As you can see, my dear Alexandra, there is much more to understand and discover regarding the intricacies of the female orgasm, including the impact of intellectual and emotional components. The research is still highly subjective, personal and seemingly dependent on each woman’s individual experience of orgasm. We can only aspire to develop a more consistent approach regarding our research and conclusions.’

    I can’t help but be enthralled with the history and mystery that seemingly surrounds this subject. I had no idea the topic was still so contested medically and in some areas considered career and research ‘taboo’, for want of a better word. How it is possible that the female orgasm is so under-researched, when the male orgasm is considered scientifically and psychologically a fait accompli is frankly shocking to me, to say the least. I can’t quite believe what I’m hearing, and indeed wouldn’t have had it not come from the mouths of the people seated around the table. I manage to quickly swallow a few mouthfuls of food before Samuel and his crew wish me luck as we pack up and make our way toward the lecture theatre.

    ‘Would you care to join us for a Friday night drink, for old times’ sake? I’m sure the team would love to share some of the insights of their research so far.’ Samuel has a twinkle in his eye as I feel my cheeks flush a pale pink.

    ‘You know I’d love to, but unfortunately I have other plans for after the lecture.’

    ‘Of course you have, my dear, one can only ask.’

    For some reason, a nervous laugh escapes me, as if I’ve been caught off-guard.

    ‘I’m actually meeting an old friend from my undergrad days; you may remember him. Jeremy Quinn?’ I try very hard to keep my tone neutral — difficult when the mere mention of his name makes my heartbeat quicken.

    ‘Yes, indeed I do. Dr Quinn is taking the medical world by storm I hear, causing all sorts of waves and excitement in the US in connection to his research on depression. He’s working with Professor Applegate, is he not?’

    I should have known Samuel would be more up to speed than I was in relation to what’s hot in global academia.

    ‘I believe so, albeit from an article, not from him personally.’

    ‘Send him my best regards. A very talented man, that Dr Quinn. No doubt there will be many a pharmaceutical company keen for his research. He certainly won’t have any of the funding concerns that constrain us, lucky chap.’

    I’m not sure I fully comprehend this connection as my mind automatically shifts into gear for the lecture just moments away.

    ‘Will do and thanks for everything, Samuel. It’s been wonderful catching up with you again. I wish you and your team the very best. Let me know if I can be of any assistance.’

    Suddenly, given the discussion at lunch, I wasn’t one hundred per cent sure whether that was an appropriate comment or not!

    ‘Indeed my dear. Go forth and conquer.’ We hug farewell and I head to the lectern for my imminent presentation

                                               ***

What a beautiful Friday afternoon in Sydney, everyone basking in glorious sunshine.

    This city can really turn it on when it needs to. The harbour is sparkling with yachts and ferries merrily bouncing along, the colours are sharp and bold and the city is bustling. Office workers are gearing up for the weekend with such a vibrant beginning, as they head off to drinks along the harbour foreshore. I see some ‘beautiful people’ bouncing along for cocktails, laughing and smiling with a buoyant swing in their step. They look like they have just stepped out of Vogue magazine. I remember when I was one of those girls, focusing on career but as carefree as the wind, with the luxury of time and whispers of what the future might hold caressing every interaction. The main priority occupying our minds then was wondering how the weekend would unfold from twilight onwards and which cocktail to choose first.

    It was on one of those nights that my relationship with Jeremy transformed from best friends constantly mucking around with each other to a high-octane sexual one. As the taxi drives past the key visual triggers where it all started in the city, I can’t help but remember the carnal lust and intensity we shared; the impact of such memories makes me squirm in my seat.

    Back then, I had just started vacation work with one of the big four banks in the city. The job wasn’t that exciting but the people were fun and it provided me with some much-needed cash during the summer holidays. It was great to be free from study for a few months and I was secretly thrilled to be wearing a suit and high heels, and mum had bought me a sensational new handbag, which I still have today …

    ‘Hi, Jeremy, I’m just going out to my first official corporate work     function—’

        ‘Yeah, I’m excited. I’ll be at the Wentworth and will be meeting     the girls at nine-ish for a drink and a boogie.’

        ‘Sure, grab them and come along. We’ll meet you there.'

        'No worries. Cool. See you later then.’

        I hang up the phone.

        He seems really keen to catch up with us all. Hmm, think     secretly, I wonder if he likes Eloise, most guys do … maybe I should     mention something … The girls think she is going through a phase     of exploring the other side, i.e. chicks, but we haven’t been able to     confirm or deny the rumour … I’m sure she’ll tell us either way     when she is ready. No, I confirm to myself, keep out of it, what will     be, will be …

        These corporate functions are cool because you get free food     and drinks. We stay for a while, then decide it is time for our real     Friday night to begin. We pack up and head to the club, where it’s     straight to the ladies room to discard jackets, our pantyhose, undo     a few buttons, plump up our cleavage, puff our hair, reapply     mascara, eyeliner and lipstick. We reappear audacious and     revamped, ready to embrace the evening.

        The music is pumping and given we have already had a few     sparkling wines, we hit the dance floor — as only a group of girls     can do. I’m lost in the music, dancing with my eyes closed, when     strong hands grasp my hips and pull me backward toward their     body. Instinctively, I know Jeremy has arrived and happily gyrate     into his swivelling hips in time to the music. For some reason, we     are in complete sync on the dance floor, our bodies are moving as     one. It’s hard not to get lost in the feel of his body against mine,     the pounding music creating a heady atmosphere around us. This is     hot with a capital H! I almost feel as if I am magnetically drawn     to him; some strange pent-up energy between us makes me     unwilling to let him go … Something has shifted between us as I     look into his darkened eyes, utterly mesmerised by the intensity of     his being. What is wrong with me tonight? My hormones seem to     be locked in lust overdrive.

        The music is too loud to hear his words, so he grabs my hand     and leads me in a determined path off the dance floor to one of the     shadowed corners of the club where the music is slightly muffled.     He pushes me gently back against the wall and places his hands     either side of my shoulders, his presence pinioning me against     the wall.In his fitted black shirt, his body looks toned and hot and     his face is glistening, close to mine, due to our heroics on the dance     floor. It takes me a moment to catch my breath as I allow myself to     become lost in his seductive presence.It is as if my eyes have been     opened for the first time as his sexual magnetism overwhelms and     draws me in. I open my mouth slightly to ensure enough oxygen     is getting to my brain.

        ‘I don’t think I can keep my hands off you any more, AB.’

        He honestly looks like he is pushing his hands harder into the     wall to keep them away from me.

        ‘Then don’t.’ Emboldened by this swelling of lust and desire, I’m     sure I must be producing alluring sexual pheromones.

        I pull his right palm off the wall, bring it to my lips, give his     middle finger a gentle kiss and slowly slide it over my breast. His     eyes widen as I continue its journey lower until it finds the secret     passage under my skirt. I part my legs slightly, never breaking     eye contact, and slide his finger past my knickers and lead him     directly to my sweet spot.

        ‘Jesus, Alex, you are so wet.’

        ‘Hmm. I am. Do you have a solution for my problem?’

        The shock on Jeremy’s face is truly priceless and I have to admit,     I never expected those words to leave my mouth, but they’re out     now. We are both a little stunned as we continue to silently     question each other to ascertain a true sense of this new reality.

        Seemingly compelled to action, Jeremy immediately removes his     hand leaving a draft in his wake, grabs my wrist and strides so     fast back toward our friends, I am almost stumbling along     behind him. I hope I haven’t offended him … maybe I shouldn’t     have said that …

        He stops suddenly and I slam into his body. Jeez!

        He grabs my handbag, marches straight to the dance floor and     shouts something in my friend’s ear, so she waves and smiles at     me. I raise my eyebrows at her and shrug my shoulders as I give     her a wave before I am just as suddenly whisked away and out the     front door of the club.

        ‘What are we doing?’

        No response. Jeremy is in action mode.

        He readjusts his hand from my wrist to clasping his fingers     through mine as we charge down the street. My ears are still     ringing from the noise of the club.

        ‘Are you not talking to me?’ Maybe he is as mad as hell. Oh     dear, what was I thinking? Maybe I’ve ruined our whole friendship.

        We are striding uphill and I’m panting to keep up with him. We     seem to be heading toward the botanical gardens. When we reach     grass, he swoops down, lifts me over his shoulder and walks     silently under the moonlight before depositing me in a standing     position under a particularly large tree. He drops my handbag to     the ground, immediately cupping my face with his hands and     devouring my mouth with such ferocity I’m forced up against the     tree. His body anchors me in position and I’m wild with lust for     him. He pulls a condom out of his pocket, unbuttons his jeans in     record time, slides it on … this is the first time I have seen Jeremy’s     penis and even though it is dark, what a sight. His eyes have     returned from their carnal state when he registers my look with a     mischievous grin.

        ‘Ready?’

        I nod in greedy agreement.

        He hitches my skirt up to my waist, lowers my knickers to my     feet, bending my knees to free them from underneath my shoes     and stuffs them in his pocket … Interesting, I can’t help but think,     kinky but interesting!

        He hoists my legs up to wrap around his waist and I curl my     arms tight around his neck with my back against the enormous     trunk of the tree. It’s rough and bark pokes into my satin blouse. I     briefly hope that it doesn’t rip the fabric but realise at this point,     I don’t care either way. He pauses before I nod again, confirming     that I am more than ready for this, beyond ready, as if we have     been teasing and tantalising and playing with each other     platonically for far too long. The sexual electricity between us     needs to explode in order for it to begin — confirming that we both     need this and we need it NOW.

        He slams into me.

        And it is glorious!

        And he does it again ...

        And it is more glorious …

        And again!

        And again!

        He impales me.

        And I am loving it.

        I stare up at the moon and release my howl in honour of its     magnificence, of our magnificence. He explodes inside me as our     carnal desire for each other is finally given physical recognition.

        Could anyone see us? Did anyone see us? Do I care …

        We lay on the grass for hours with each other, wondering at     each other, talking and playing and laughing and teasing. Until the     night lightens and dawn breaks. It’s as if we have been in a void of     time. We stumble into a taxi together; I fall asleep on his shoulder     and find myself tucked in my bed a few hours later. My first time     with Jeremy is confirmed to be a reality and not a dream by the     twigs in my hair and grass stains on my shirt. My knickers     apparently never made it home …

I let out a sigh. Wow! I’m sure I am flushing and I know I’m wriggling around in my seat. I’m glad the driver hasn’t noticed. I smile to myself at the distant, delicious memory. I haven’t felt like this for years, well, probably since the last time I saw Jeremy alone. The fun days and carefree nights, no responsibilities — although we thought we had them at the time — no kids, no house, no mortgage … Would I honestly want life to be any different from what it is now? Not really, a bit more fun and carefree every now and then wouldn’t go astray, but I am reasonably happy with my life as it is now. Not my sex life admittedly, which has been less than average since Jordan was born, or pretty well non-existent if I’m perfectly honest. That thought is a shock. How have I missed this? Have I been too busy in life to notice this key element has gone missing? Isn’t it even more concerning that I haven’t considered it an issue? No wonder I’m sitting in the back of a taxi in a state of latent, lustful desire. A vision enters my mind of sleeping beauty awaiting her sexual awakening after decades of sleep, which is quite sweet until I realise her face is mine and the prince is Jeremy. But the kids, remember the kids … Would it be worth the risk? I resolutely block my mind from receiving any more of these unproductive thoughts.

    It feels good having the first lecture successfully behind me. The feedback and questions have given me more food for thought in respect to further investigative and academic research. I think ahead to my weekend. Catching up with my old school friends over a glass of wine, their careers, their social lives and family news. Who’s still with whom, who has moved on, and I’m sure there are a few more babies I have missed since being based in Tasmania. Then catching up with my siblings and nieces and nephews for a BBQ on Sunday. It’s a shame Jordan and Elizabeth won’t be there, as they love catching up with their cousins, but next time perhaps.

    With my trip down memory lane and thoughts about the weekend ahead, I’m a little surprised how quickly we have arrived at the destination. I quickly check my lipstick and hair and decide I will definitely need to refresh in the hotel lobby. As I pay the taxi driver, the butterflies previously asleep in my stomach announce their tumultuous arrival and my palms moisten as I gather my bags together.

    That memory has certainly destabilised me more than I would have liked. Stay calm and composed, you are a professional, married woman, a mother of two … Enough with the self-talk!

    I head straight through the lobby of the five-star hotel to the ladies room in an attempt to stabilise my stomach. What is going on with me today? I shake my head and try to pull myself together. The tingle down below is certainly not helping to calm my nerves nor my ability to control my physiology. Quite frustrating to say the least. How is it that I felt perfectly comfortable lecturing to hundreds of people just hours ago, yet now my fingers are trembling so badly that I can barely unwind my lipstick?

    I gaze into the mirror while both hands grip the basin. I notice the slight wrinkles around my eyes. Were they there last time I saw Jeremy? Maybe I should have taken my friend’s advice and given Botox a try, in her words ‘before it’s too late!’ I shudder at the thought of it. I can’t stand anything around my eyes let alone the idea of an injection piercing through such sensitive skin. Oh well, I think to myself, I’ll just have to put up with what I see in the mirror until they come up with something a little less invasive.

    Distracted and flustered, I can’t decide whether to leave my hair up or take it out. I’m grateful my hair is still dark and as yet I haven’t managed to find a random grey strand, although I’m sure that day isn’t far off. I figure I will stay with the more professional look and leave it up; I am in a suit after all. Right, all ready to go, or at least as ready as I will ever be. Not too bad for thirty-six. I take a final glance in the mirror, and think it could certainly be worse, as I desperately search for a positive spin. Deep down, I am very much looking forward to catching up with Jeremy. So I let myself run with that emotion as my mind takes me on another quick trip down memory lane …

    Jeremy and I were at university together, although he was two years ahead of me. My cousin introduced us during my first year, as they were both in the same water polo team. I’m not absolutely sure how our acquaintance evolved but he was a lot of fun and as we spent more and more time together we eventually became best friends, almost by default. As time went by we explored drinking, drugs and sex — as many uni students do. Partners came and went throughout our years of study but we were always there for each other, first and foremost. It was difficult for people to describe, let alone determine, our relationship with each other, more than likely because it was also impossible for us. After a while, our friends didn’t bother to try and label us and just accepted that Jeremy and I would be friends forever, whatever came our way. Funnily enough, over time, we eventually accepted it too …

    Life took us in different directions post-university. Jeremy continued his studies before getting his pilot’s licence and joining the flying doctor service for a truly Australian outback experience, which he loved and I was always a little jealous of (the pilot’s licence anyway). I worked in London focusing on building strong financial foundations before further exploring psychology in the workplace.

    We caught up in various locations around the globe over the next decade, particularly in Europe where his medical research brought him regularly to London. We had many short funfilled flings that are treasured memories, before we embarked on the serious responsibilities of life. Although we knew our relationship was significant in our lives, we understood that it would never be long-term, or at least I knew that Jeremy was far from ready to settle down, unlike me. It was the ‘unspoken word’ between us, although, deep down, we knew it to be a fully acknowledged reality.

    His career was of paramount importance to him and I desperately wanted to start a family and our differing worlds drifted apart. Jeremy was offered a lucrative research scholarship at Harvard to further his studies and moved to America. I met my English husband, Robert, in London and we returned together to Australia. I knew I needed to put my explicit sexual past with Jeremy behind me and settle down to start a family and pursue my career academically. Which is exactly what I did.

    Although we caught up for the odd dinner here and there, for the next decade or so, we were essentially on opposite sides of the planet. And our lives continued separately …

    I pull my mind back to the here and now and tell myself firmly that camping out in the ladies is just wasting the precious time we will have together — so get moving! I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, straighten my shoulders, hold my head high, swing open the door and walk confidently out toward the man who is my best friend and my ex-lover.

    As my eyes sweep the lobby bar, my confidence evaporates as quickly as it had been conjured up — he is not here. Disappointment washes over me with such ferocity, I have to lower my hand to the lounge to maintain my standing position. Typical, I think to myself; I started the day with butterflies and ridiculous thoughts, like a teenager anticipating seeing their ultimate pop idol for the first time, and ended it talking to myself in the ladies room of a flash hotel.

    I do know how hectic Jeremy’s life is and that his schedule is ever-changing. Of course it would be highly unlikely for him to catch up with me just because we both happen to be coincidentally in Sydney this weekend. I am disappointed that I have wasted so much nervous energy for nothing, yet a part of me feels pleased that I am still able to feel those sensations when I had thought they were long gone. It serves me right really; I should have stayed and had drinks with Samuel and his colleagues. But I eagerly declined knowing I would be meeting with Jeremy and didn’t want to be late.

    Jeremy’s assistant had said he would be caught up in meetings most of the afternoon. Just as I think to check my phone for messages, a man in uniform with a concierge badge on approaches me.

    ‘Excuse me. Doctor Alexandra Blake?’

    ‘Oh. Yes.’

    ‘A gentleman asked me to pass this message on to you and convey his sincere apologies that he is unable to meet you here.’

    My heart sinks as my fears are now confirmed; he can’t make it. Disappointment washes over me all over again.

    He hands me an envelope. ‘Thank you very much, Doctor Blake. If there is anything I can help you with, please don’t hesitate to ask.’

    I smile as much to myself as to the concierge. Jeremy always insisted on calling me ‘Doctor’ once I graduated with my PhD, even though he is the true medical doctor and I am the philosophical kind. He knows I’m not good at medical emergencies and have an inherent fear of hospitals, so it was always a joke between us.

    I take a seat on the velvet lounge and open the envelope to pull out the typed note inside:

    To my dearest friend, Doctor A. Blake,

        My sincere apologies for leaving you stranded in the hotel lobby     this Friday evening. I had a few unavoidable errands come up at     the last minute, which have caused some delays. Everything seems     to be in order now and I would very much appreciate you joining     me upstairs for a drink. It has been too long!

        Please find the security key for the penthouse floor in the     envelope.

        I eagerly anticipate your arrival.

        Love,

        J. xo

My stomach flips and turns like a gymnast competing for the Olympic gold medal. Once again I am instantly transformed into a teenage groupie — he is here after all! But what is he doing in the penthouse? The Jeremy I knew always shunned the flashier side of life, preferring to maintain a more austere public persona. Although, if I remember rightly, when surrounded by those who knew him well, he could certainly relax into a mischievous rebel at times, enjoying the finer things life had to offer. Perhaps Samuel’s comments weren’t misguided when mentioning the bottomless funding of pharmaceutical companies. I can only wonder if the Jeremy of old still exists in the Jeremy of now.

                                               ***

    As I gather myself together both mentally and physically, I notice the concierge still hovering in the background — does he have nothing better to do? The thought randomly floats through my brain.

    ‘Is everything in order, Doctor Blake, can I help in any way?’

    I wonder what expression I have on my face as I turn to look at him. I notice the faintest of smiles at the corner of his mouth, his eyes twinkling. Dumbfounded, I shake my head. ‘No, thank you, I’m fine.’

    Was I? I am beginning to wonder. He continues to loiter behind me. I change my mind and turn to him.

    ‘Actually, yes. Could you please show me the way to the lift for the penthouse?’

    ‘Of course, Doctor Blake, it would be my pleasure. Right this way and may I take your bags?’

    He says it in a way that makes me think he is in on something I don’t quite comprehend, and a strange feeling passes through me. Perhaps I’m just not up to speed on the service at five-star hotels these days. Knowing I’m not feeling exactly normal at this point, I push the thought out of my head and conclude that my mind could easily be playing tricks on me.

    ‘Thank you, that would be lovely,’ I say politely, and follow him as he leads the way to the lift with my bags in tow.

    Seconds later the lift is racing rapidly toward the lofty heights of the penthouse floor. I take a few deep breaths in an attempt to calm my nerves. What a wonderful idea to have a drink while overlooking the city as twilight descends, always a spectacular view with weather like today. I’m not sure if Jeremy is staying in the hotel, but if he has access to the business lounge we may be able to have complimentary nibbles and drinks. Strange how the concept of free drinks still resonates with me, must be left over from uni days … I let out a little chuckle. The concierge must think I’m crazy.

    As the doors open, I realise I am genuinely excited about seeing Jeremy; he is an amazing man and a truly great friend. The disappointment of believing he couldn’t meet me had hit me harder than I ever imagined possible. Now I feel happy, excited and very much looking forward to a wonderful heartfelt reunion as only best friends can.

    I am assaulted by the magnificent views in front me as I step out of the lift and into a carpeted room with floor-to-ceiling windows — I had forgotten how truly captivating Sydney Harbour is from these spectacular heights. I take a moment to absorb the visual feast before my eyes. Sparkling blue water with tiny white flecks. Ferries and yachts curve arching ripples across the silky water, and the buildings imbued with a rosy glow, reflecting the light of the sinking sun. Looking around to orientate myself, it seems strange I can’t see any bar on this level.

    ‘This way please, Doctor.’ I almost forget the concierge is standing beside me with my bag. I check the security card and notice the symbol on it matches the one the wall. I follow the arrows with my eyes as we walk in silence. ;Finally I find myself standing tentatively in front of large double doors. Before either of us have a moment to press the buzzer, the door flies open in front of us. And standing before me is Jeremy. More sophisticatedly handsome than I had dared allow myself to remember.

    ‘Hey AB, there you are. Welcome.’

    ‘Hi,’ I respond, fairly quietly, almost shyly. ‘It’s been a while.’

    ‘I see Roger found you in the lobby. Thanks for taking care of her for me. I’ll take it from here, cheers.’ He takes my bag from the concierge and ushers me in, closing the door behind me.

    ‘You’re right; it has been too long, way too long in my opinion.’ He excitedly wraps his arms around me, almost lifting me off the floor in an all-embracing hug, his eyes twinkling all the while.

    ‘Let me look at you.’ He holds me at arm’s length and his eyes absorb my face, my hair, my body, my legs, right down to my toes. I had forgotten how penetrating his stare could be and it catches me unawares, leaving me suddenly feeling utterly self-conscious. I quickly look away to avoid seeing any further analysis.

    ‘You look wonderful, Alex, still my young green-eyed Catherine Zeta-Jones,’ he says intently, this time embracing me softly, lightly kissing my forehead, as if giving me his stamp of approval.

    ‘And you aren’t looking too bad yourself given you’re almost forty, Dr Quinn,’ I say cheekily, needing to immediately lighten the mood, both because of his possessive words and the intense emotions rushing through my body.

    I don’t trust myself to fully absorb his appearance but at first glance it doesn’t look like much has changed over the years, except a little salt gently peppering his dark hair. Still confident, toned, mischievous … he does look good. If I’m really honest he looks great, actually; broad, square shoulders, six foot two inches tall, clean shaven. He smells beautiful. It has been many years since I have been this intimate with his spicy, outdoorsy scent but the cloud of arousal it stirs up penetrates deep within my core; his tight round arse looks sensational in his causal trousers. Dear god, I am in sensory overload and I have just arrived … Stop it! Look somewhere else, I scream internally as I command my eyes to slide off his body to the broader environment.

    ‘Wow, this place is amazing. Are you staying here?’

    ‘Yes, indeed I am. I’m here for the week.’

    ‘Well, you have certainly moved up in the world, my friend.’ He shrugs his shoulders and grins sheepishly. I love that smile. I love those lips. I love those lips on my breasts. God! Stop this, now.

    ‘Come on in. Relax, please make yourself at home.’ Jeremy leads me to the lounge room, obviously sensing I’m far from relaxed. Working myself into a right state would be more accurate.

    ‘I thought we were meeting at a penthouse bar for a drink. I wasn’t expecting to be in your suite.’ I try to keep my voice conversational, tempering my rising level of anxiety.

    ‘Does that cause you any concern?’ he asks directly.

    ‘Ah, oh, no.’ I stumble the words out. ‘No, not at all.’ Should it? I think to myself.

    ‘Good.’

    I hear the pop of a cork, which startles me a little, and Jeremy pours me a glass of champagne. It is perfectly chilled and the bubbles within the crystal glass provide me with a visual representation of how my stomach has been feeling most of the day.

    ‘Cheers, Doctor Blake. I’ve missed you, my friend, my confidante.’

    My heart skips a beat as he utters these words, my mind comprehending the emotional depth attached to them.

    ‘Cheers to you too, Dr Quinn.’ We clink our glasses together as our eyes capture one another’s gaze for the first time in a very long time.

    ‘How are you, Jeremy? How is your life going? Have you met anyone? Are you enjoying the US? And what about work, you sound so busy with everything …’ God, I can’t stop myself blathering! He laughs as he raises his hand to interrupt my inquisition.

    ‘You’ve never been short of a question, Alexa, have you?’ He raises one eyebrow and pauses. ‘I suppose some things never change.’ His comment is teasing and laced with innuendo.

    His look is direct, though somewhat mischievous at the same time. I shuffle uncomfortably at the intensity of his stare and the weight I assume is behind his words. I wish I could read his facial expressions more clearly but as we haven’t seen each other for so long, they are unfortunately too masked for me to decipher at this point.

    ‘It’s just that there is always so much to catch up on in the time we have. I don’t want to miss anything, don’t want to waste our conversation,’ I reply in my defence.

    ‘We won’t, I promise you. Now drink up.’

    I notice I still haven’t touched my champagne. We both sip a mouthful of the golden bubbles at the same time. It tastes so delicious, initially dry with a sweet aftertaste and I feel the bubbles pop on my tongue. I can’t help but take another.

    ‘Now, before I attempt to answer your myriad questions, tell me, what are your plans for this weekend? Who has the pleasure of your company?’

    Happy to ease back into conversation, I comfortably rattle off the details of my weekend, particularly as he knows most of the people I am seeing. I tell him about Robert and the kids being away on their great adventure and about my catching up with Samuel at the university, my family and my old school friends.

    He listens attentively, without interrupting, and I barely notice as he refills my glass. I can’t say whether it is nerves or excitement that keeps my chatter going and the champagne flowing.

    ‘Enough about me.’ I realise Jeremy hasn’t spoken in some time and we have plenty to discuss other than my plans for the weekend. I stop to look at him more carefully and notice his tense expression. ‘You’re very quiet, Jeremy. Is there something wrong?’

    He stands up and walks deliberately toward where I’m seated on the lounge. Silently, he squats on the floor ensuring he is looking directly into my eyes and places his hand on my stockinged knee. A mild electric current travels straight up my leg and I jerk at the sensation. The hint of a smile emerges on his face at my reaction, as if pleased he still has this impact, before it quickly disappears and he regains focus and control of the moment. I immediately blush, blending perfectly with the rose cushion at my back. There is no way he can’t notice that I am practically beside myself at his touch. Completely embarrassed, I shift my body weight uneasily on the lounge, while his position is statuesque. My rising anxiety immediately prevents me from uttering a sound.

    ‘Alexandra, I want to ask you something and I’m honestly not sure what you will say or how you’ll react.’

    It must be serious if he is using my full name.

    He pauses, staring unrelentingly into my eyes.

    ‘Which is unusual for me …’ he muses.

    He fixes both hands firmly on my knees, as if anchoring my feet to the ground lest I should fly away like a helium balloon. ‘So, I’ll just come straight out with it.’

    I don’t move an inch.

    I do nothing except hold his gaze.

    I concentrate on moderating my breathing.

    I wait for him to continue.

    ‘I would like you to stay the weekend here with me and cancel your other plans.’ He pauses, looking at me from beneath his long, thick eyelashes. My heart literally skips a beat.

    Or two. Or maybe three.

    As his gaze intensifies, I become lost in his eyes.

    Our shared, ancient memories come flooding back into my brain: flashes of university days, ridiculous pranks, lust and love and orgasms and sex, friendship, tears of laughter, tears of pain, experimentation, stolen moments. It was fun, it was edgy, exhilarating and exciting, and there seemed to be no other way with Jeremy.

    The look in his eyes conveys all of that and more to me in a few long seconds. I never knew quite what was going to happen next with Jeremy and here I am, all these years later in the same situation.

    Albeit with very different life circumstances. Our silent dialogue continues dancing between us. Once again daring us to take a risk that would never be taken with anyone else, only each other.

    My mind begins to race as fast as my heart.

    What if I did stay? Would it be the worst thing I could do? People always talk about living life to the fullest, expecting the unexpected … Wouldn’t a weekend with Jeremy make me feel more alive than I have in years? Given the effect of his touch on my knee, I can only imagine how I would respond to, well, his touch on other parts of my body …

    Finally, my motherly instinct anchors these abstract and fleeting thoughts so commonsense can prevail. My children. My life isn’t just about me any more; there are consequences for my actions. The guilt … the betrayal … Robert …. My stomach is in knots. How can I feel such anticipation and remorse simultaneously? It doesn’t make sense to me. My clinical mind quickly shifts a gear and makes a mental note to explore the psychology around such intense emotions and the resulting change in my physiology. My immediate situation renders my clinical experience redundant. God, what am I doing, thinking, feeling? Jeremy still has his hands on my knees as his eyes bore into my soul. Moments pass until, as if reading my thoughts, he releases his hold on my eyes and withdraws his touch, rising to step toward the panoramic view.

    I immediately inhale as if I have been released from a spell. I must have been holding my breath for quite some time. As he continues to stare out toward the harbour, he says, in a bemused voice: ‘Let me guess. You are currently analysing every angle of this situation.’ He turns to look into my eyes once again before returning his gaze outward and nods, as if to confirm for himself that he is on the right track before continuing.

    ‘You are weighing up the pros and cons of accepting my offer. One side of you is excited, enticed almost, about the possibilities of the experience, the other is fully grounded in the responsibilities of your existing life, giving rise to endless questions and what-if scenarios and which mean you need more time for consideration and reflection. Truly, Alex, it would take many lifetimes’ worth of experience to answer your questions and even then, never reach a satisfactory conclusion. Am I right?’ Once again, looking toward me for confirmation.

    All I can do is nod my head in agreement. He is reading me like a book. Actually, if I’m truly honest about it, he is reading me better than I can read myself, which disturbs me no end. The accuracy of his words catches me off-guard, his summary both measured and precise. Am I that easy to read or does he really know me that well? I thought he would have forgotten over the years … but if I haven’t, how could I naively assume he had? That is a truly scary consideration given my current predicament. He continues with his barrage of my presumed concerns.

    ‘What about your family? Do you really want this? What will it mean if you stay? What would your friends think? How would you justify your decision? Could you live with yourself? And dare I say it, what would happen if you truly let yourself go, even if it were just for one weekend?’

    I sit before him, embarrassed at the truth behind his take on my questions, by the depth of his knowledge of my thought processes. But I also know he isn’t playing fair now and is deliberately pushing my personal boundaries.

    His last question was the summation of many of our conversations throughout our relationship. He knows I put others before myself and always castigated me about it, particularly if I chose paths he could see ending badly for me. He always made me ponder the question of ‘what if’? What if, just once, I didn’t try to control or orchestrate myself and others, didn’t play it safe? What if it was a good thing to not know what was going to happen next or how someone was going to feel about it? Could it still be worth the risk?

    My immediate concerns were, unfortunately, way too easy to summarise given the moral dilemma I faced. The real issue for me is, in reality, quite simple — can I say no to Jeremy?

    He is playing me well. I know it and he certainly knows it. Even though I try to erase any distinctive emotion, he can read my face intuitively, see through any mask I put on. His understated smirk causes me greater anxiety than the myriad other feelings I am filtering through my head.

    My voice arrives quietly but firmly.

    ‘That’s really not fair, Jeremy. Do we have to have this conversation right now? Can’t we just catch up and see how things go?’ My voice trails off at these words. He knows I’m trying to hedge my bets and he can easily see through my attempted poker face, never a good position to be in with him. I unconsciously brace myself for our battle of minds, knowing that my brain is in a boxing ring with the right side fighting with the left, both deftly defending their position without understanding they are both on the same team — not helpful.

    He walks slowly and deliberately away from the glass panels over to the champagne bucket, carefully picks up the bottle and walks back toward me. He silently notices my hands trembling as he slides his hand down along my fingers and removes the glass I’m holding, refills it and places it carefully on the side table next to the lounge. He kneels in front of me, holding both my hands in his and lets out a sigh. The power and presence emanating from him is in stark contrast to his apparently submissive position on the floor. I can barely breathe the air between us it is so thick with tension. I feel like a deer caught in headlights.

    ‘Now Alex, listen to me, and please listen carefully.’ His voice is slow, firm, commanding. ‘You and I go a long way back and I want to spend the next forty-eight hours with you. I don’t want to have a few drinks and have you disappear into the universe again.

    ‘I know it has been tense between us since you arrived and that’s because we’re constrained by time. If we know we have two full days together, we will be able to really get to know each other again. Let it be just about us, no one else — just this once. It’s important to me, Alex, I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t. I don’t want to argue with you, I don’t want to scare you, I just need to know now that we will have this time together, time we haven’t had for many years.’

    My ears are ringing in confusion, as is my heart. The electric current running from his hand into mine lands straight between my legs, so much so, that I almost believe he can feel it.

    He wraps his fingers around my wrists, his eyes pleading with mine. ‘Please. Alex, I’m begging you … forty-eight hours? Tell me you’ll stay.’

    My mind has gone AWOL. I can barely breathe, let alone speak. What is he doing to me? I have never heard him sound like this, so needy, so longing. I think to myself that maybe he is in some type of trouble or pain and needs to talk about it. My heart says, Yes that’s it, he is my best friend and he needs me. Of course, I should have picked up on it before. Why else would he sound so beseeching? He probably doesn’t have too many close friends he can talk to like he can with me, particularly given the pressure and responsibility of his job and research commitments. He obviously needs to talk otherwise he wouldn’t be putting me in this situation. And here I am, contemplating not being there for my friend, my best friend, just when he needs me.

    Needless to say, I lose the battle as my voice concurs with my heart’s logic. And I hear myself say ever so softly, ‘I suppose … I could …’ I can barely get the words out of my constricted throat as they form an almost inaudible whisper.

    But because Jeremy is still so close, he hears them. With eagerness written all over his face he asks, ‘Did you say what I think you said?’

    Is he really trying to make me say it again? It was hard enough the first time.

    ‘I need to know you’re committed. You have no idea how important this is to me.’

    I take a deep breath.

    ‘Yes, I will stay for the weekend,’ I confirm, a little more clearly.

    A smile instantly washes over his face as he releases my wrists, sweeps me off the lounge and embraces me tightly as he spins me around the room. I can’t help but laugh as the tension vanishes between us.

    ‘Thank you, Alexandra. You won’t regret it, I promise.’

    He excitedly reaches for the waiting glasses of champagne. ‘Let’s toast. To the next forty-eight hours.’

    To which I can’t help but think, Oh dear, but toast him nonetheless and allow the bubbles of the champagne to join their butterfly friends in my stomach.

    Before I can come to terms with the reality of my agreement, he says, quick as a flash, ‘Right. AB, where’s your phone?’

    Of course, I will need to let others know of my sudden change of plans, the forthcoming consequences to my family and friends finally dawning on me.

    ‘What am I going to say? What will they think?’ I am talking out loud as I fumble around in my congested handbag and locate my phone. Reservations once again creep into my thoughts.Am I doing the right thing? Was it a moment of weakness or desire that made me say yes? Undoubtedly both!

    ‘Jeremy, maybe I shouldn’t … it’s not right …’

    ‘No buts, no regrets, AB!’

    Jeremy bounces right next to me on the lounge, as if sensing my apprehension and second thoughts. He snatches the phone out of my hand and strides to the other side of the room. The excitable puppy is turning panther-like with frightening ease and grace.

    ‘Let me take care of that for you,’ he says with a huge grin on his face.

    He has completely regressed. Where is the distinguished, globally acknowledged and multi-award-winning medical research doctor? I am apparently back at uni with my cocky mate, still teasing and tormenting me.

    ‘Please give it back.’

    ‘Not on your life, sweetheart, you’re mine for the weekend. You just said so yourself. Don’t worry, I will send through a message on your behalf.’

    I have no idea whether he is serious or not.

    ‘I am more than capable of sending a message from my own phone.’ I walk over to where he is standing, my hand outstretched, waiting. ‘Give it to me, now.’ My voice is stern as he ducks and weaves, manoeuvring himself away from me like a complete idiot.

    ‘I need to call home. JEREMY!’ I scream at him as he continues his childish movements around the room.

    ‘No, you don’t need to call home. You just told me they are in the wilderness, with no phone reception for the next week. There is absolutely no reason you need to call them or worry about it.’

    So that explains the intense interest with which he was listening to my plans. I should have known he had an ulterior motive.

    ‘Jeremy, stop mucking around.’ Panic starts to permeate my voice as he runs into the bedroom closing the door behind him.

    ‘This is not funny. Give me my damn phone, you bastard.’ I furiously pound on the door he is obviously leaning against to keep me out.

    ‘Ah, there’s the feisty Alex I know. There’s the spark I’ve been hoping for … Now, whom do we need to inform of your intriguing change of plans? Your brother. And Trish, she can then send to the others … oh, and Sally. That should just about do it, shouldn’t it?’

    ‘Jeremy, don’t you dare!’ I am seething.

    He comes out from behind the door, ensuring I am well away from him as he reads out the message. Before I can respond, he presses Send.

    ‘You didn’t?’ I gasp.

    ‘There, you are officially mine for the next forty-eight hours.’ He looks like the cat that swallowed the canary.

    He then turns off my phone, walks over to the cupboard, opens the door, presses a code to open the safe while blocking my view, places the phone inside and promptly locks the door.

    He spins around to see the look of absolute shock on my face.

    ‘What the hell do you think you are doing?’ I explode. ‘I need to have that phone with me. Anything could happen.’

    I feel as if he has temporarily disconnected me from my life. I realise that is exactly what he is hoping to achieve. I find it a very strange, weird sensation, being completely uncontactable.

    ‘Explain to me, AB. Are you saying that the world won’t survive with your phone switched off for a couple of days, or you won’t?’

    The tone of his voice and the look in his eyes clearly tells me that any arguments regarding this matter will be futile.

    ‘Why are you doing this?’

    ‘Simple. I’m being selfish. I know that you are always available to your family and friends and I have no intentions of sharing you with anyone else this weekend. That means no interruptions.’

    I stare at him dumbfounded. ‘When did you become so bossy and controlling?’

    ‘I had a good teacher at university, and I’ve been practising for the past few years,’ he says, winking at me.

    As I move toward the cupboard, his octopus arms grab me around the waist and hoist me into the air before firmly depositing me on the lounge.

    ‘I don’t think so.’ He is grinning now.

    ‘We are not at uni now, Jeremy. I’m a grown woman, for god’s sake!’ I sound like a school teacher. He stands over me, eagerly anticipating my next move.

    ‘Fine,’ I say, folding my arms across my chest, clearly not happy. ‘Well, you put your phone in as well — that’s only fair.’

    He laughs. ‘You always did have to have the last word, Alexandra, didn’t you?’

    He turns his phone off and with elaborate arm movements, opens the safe, places his phone next to mine and swiftly locks it again.

72,It's Money That Matters,"Of all of the people that I used to know
Most never adjusted to the great big world

Workin' for the public radio
Carryin' their babies around in sacks on their backs
Movin' careful and slow

It's money that matters
Hear what I say
It's money that matters
In the U.S.A

All of these people are much brighter than I
In any fair system they would flourish and thrive
But they barely survive
They eke out a living
They barely survive

When I was a young boy, maybe thirteen
I took a hard look around me, asked ""What does it mean?""

So I talked to my father; he didn't know
I talked to my friend; he didn't know
I talked to my brother; he didn't know
I talked to everybody that I knew

It's money that matters
Now, you know that it's true
It's money that matters
Whatever you do

I talked to a man lived up on the county line
I was washin' his car with a friend of mine

He was a little fat guy in a red jumpsuit
I said, ""That looks kinda funny""; he said, ""I know it does too -
But I got a great big house on the hill here
Great big blonde wife inside it
Great big pool in my back yard
Another great big pool beside it!

78,"Wild Again (From ""Cocktail"")","SOME OF THE CADDIES were poor as sin and lived in one-room houses with a neurasthenic cow in the front yard, but Dexter Green's father owned the second best grocery-store in Black Bear--the best one was ""The Hub,"" patronized by the wealthy people from Sherry Island--and Dexter caddied only for pocket-money.
In the fall when the days became crisp and gray, and the long Minnesota winter shut down like the white lid of a box, Dexter's skis moved over the snow that hid the fairways of the golf course. At these times the country gave him a feeling of profound melancholy--it offended him that the links should lie in enforced fallowness, haunted by ragged sparrows for the long season. It was dreary, too, that on the tees where the gay colors fluttered in summer there were now only the desolate sand-boxes knee-deep in crusted ice. When he crossed the hills the wind blew cold as misery, and if the sun was out he tramped with his eyes squinted up against the hard dimensionless glare.

In April the winter ceased abruptly. The snow ran down into Black Bear Lake scarcely tarrying for the early golfers to brave the season with red and black balls. Without elation, without an interval of moist glory, the cold was gone.

Dexter knew that there was something dismal about this Northern spring, just as he knew there was something gorgeous about the fall. Fall made him clinch his hands and tremble and repeat idiotic sentences to himself, and make brisk abrupt gestures of command to imaginary audiences and armies. October filled him with hope which November raised to a sort of ecstatic triumph, and in this mood the fleeting brilliant impressions of the summer at Sherry Island were ready grist to his mill. He became a golf champion and defeated Mr. T. A. Hedrick in a marvellous match played a hundred times over the fairways of his imagination, a match each detail of which he changed about untiringly--sometimes he won with almost laughable ease, sometimes he came up magnificently from behind. Again, stepping from a Pierce-Arrow automobile, like Mr. Mortimer Jones, he strolled frigidly into the lounge of the Sherry Island Golf Club-- or perhaps, surrounded by an admiring crowd, he gave an exhibition of fancy diving from the spring-board of the club raft. . . . Among those who watched him in open-mouthed wonder was Mr. Mortimer Jones.

And one day it came to pass that Mr. Jones--himself and not his ghost-- came up to Dexter with tears in his eyes and said that Dexter was the----best caddy in the club, and wouldn't he decide not to quit if Mr. Jones made it worth his while, because every other caddy in the club lost one ball a hole for him-- regularly----

""No, sir,"" said Dexter decisively, ""I don't want to caddy any more."" Then, after a pause: ""I'm too old.""

""You're not more than fourteen. Why the devil did you decide just this morning that you wanted to quit? You promised that next week you'd go over to the State tournament with me.""

""I decided I was too old.""

Dexter handed in his ""A Class"" badge, collected what money was due him from the caddy master, and walked home to Black Bear Village.

""The best----caddy I ever saw,"" shouted Mr. Mortimer Jones over a drink that afternoon. ""Never lost a ball! Willing! Intelligent! Quiet! Honest! Grateful!""

The little girl who had done this was eleven--beautifully ugly as little girls are apt to be who are destined after a few years to be inexpressibly lovely and bring no end of misery to a great number of men. The spark, however, was perceptible. There was a general ungodliness in the way her lips twisted ,down at the corners when she smiled, and in the--Heaven help us!--in the almost passionate quality of her eyes. Vitality is born early in such women. It was utterly in evidence now, shining through her thin frame in a sort of glow.

She had come eagerly out on to the course at nine o'clock with a white linen nurse and five small new golf-clubs in a white canvas bag which the nurse was carrying. When Dexter first saw her she was standing by the caddy house, rather ill at ease and trying to conceal the fact by engaging her nurse in an obviously unnatural conversation graced by startling and irrelevant grimaces from herself.

""Well, it's certainly a nice day, Hilda,"" Dexter heard her say. She drew down the corners of her mouth, smiled, and glanced furtively around, her eyes in transit falling for an instant on Dexter.

Then to the nurse:

""Well, I guess there aren't very many people out here this morning, are there?""

The smile again--radiant, blatantly artificial--convincing.

""I don't know what we're supposed to do now,"" said the nurse, looking nowhere in particular.

""Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it up.

Dexter stood perfectly still, his mouth slightly ajar. He knew that if he moved forward a step his stare would be in her line of vision--if he moved backward he would lose his full view of her face. For a moment he had not realized how young she was. Now he remembered having seen her several times the year before in bloomers.

Suddenly, involuntarily, he laughed, a short abrupt laugh-- then, startled by himself, he turned and began to walk quickly away.

""Boy!""

Dexter stopped.

""Boy----""

Beyond question he was addressed. Not only that, but he was treated to that absurd smile, that preposterous smile--the memory of which at least a dozen men were to carry into middle age.

""Boy, do you know where the golf teacher is?""

""He's giving a lesson.""

""Well, do you know where the caddy-master is?""

""He isn't here yet this morning.""

""Oh."" For a moment this baffled her. She stood alternately on her right and left foot.

""We'd like to get a caddy,"" said the nurse. ""Mrs. Mortimer Jones sent us out to play golf, and we don't know how without we get a caddy.""

Here she was stopped by an ominous glance from Miss Jones, followed immediately by the smile.

""There aren't any caddies here except me,"" said Dexter to the nurse, ""and I got to stay here in charge until the caddy-master gets here.""

""Oh.""

Miss Jones and her retinue now withdrew, and at a proper distance from Dexter became involved in a heated conversation, which was concluded by Miss Jones taking one of the clubs and hitting it on the ground with violence. For further emphasis she raised it again and was about to bring it down smartly upon the nurse's bosom, when the nurse seized the club and twisted it from her hands.

""You damn little mean old thing!"" cried Miss Jones wildly.

Another argument ensued. Realizing that the elements of the comedy were implied in the scene, Dexter several times began to laugh, but each time restrained the laugh before it reached audibility. He could not resist the monstrous conviction that the little girl was justified in beating the nurse.

The situation was resolved by the fortuitous appearance of the caddymaster, who was appealed to immediately by the nurse.

""Miss Jones is to have a little caddy, and this one says he can't go.""

""Mr. McKenna said I was to wait here till you came,"" said Dexter quickly.

""Well, he's here now."" Miss Jones smiled cheerfully at the caddy-master. Then she dropped her bag and set off at a haughty mince toward the first tee.

""Well?"" The caddy-master turned to Dexter. ""What you standing there like a dummy for? Go pick up the young lady's clubs.""

""I don't think I'll go out to-day,"" said Dexter.

""You don't----""

""I think I'll quit.""

The enormity of his decision frightened him. He was a favorite caddy, and the thirty dollars a month he earned through the summer were not to be made elsewhere around the lake. But he had received a strong emotional shock, and his perturbation required a violent and immediate outlet.

It is not so simple as that, either. As so frequently would be the case in the future, Dexter was unconsciously dictated to by his winter dreams.

II

NOW, OF COURSE, the quality and the seasonability of these winter dreams varied, but the stuff of them remained. They persuaded Dexter several years later to pass up a business course at the State university--his father, prospering now, would have paid his way--for the precarious advantage of attending an older and more famous university in the East, where he was bothered by his scanty funds. But do not get the impression, because his winter dreams happened to be concerned at first with musings on the rich, that there was anything merely snobbish in the boy. He wanted not association with glittering things and glittering people--he wanted the glittering things themselves. Often he reached out for the best without knowing why he wanted it--and sometimes he ran up against the mysterious denials and prohibitions in which life indulges. It is with one of those denials and not with his career as a whole that this story deals.
He made money. It was rather amazing. After college he went to the city from which Black Bear Lake draws its wealthy patrons. When he was only twenty-three and had been there not quite two years, there were already people who liked to say: ""Now there's a boy--"" All about him rich men's sons were peddling bonds precariously, or investing patrimonies precariously, or plodding through the two dozen volumes of the ""George Washington Commercial Course,"" but Dexter borrowed a thousand dollars on his college degree and his confident mouth, and bought a partnership in a laundry.

It was a small laundry when he went into it but Dexter made a specialty of learning how the English washed fine woollen golf-stockings without shrinking them, and within a year he was catering to the trade that wore knickerbockers. Men were insisting that their Shetland hose and sweaters go to his laundry just as they had insisted on a caddy who could find golfballs. A little later he was doing their wives' lingerie as well--and running five branches in different parts of the city. Before he was twenty-seven he owned the largest string of laundries in his section of the country. It was then that he sold out and went to New York. But the part of his story that concerns us goes back to the days when he was making his first big success.

When he was twenty-three Mr. Hart--one of the gray-haired men who like to say ""Now there's a boy""--gave him a guest card to the Sherry Island Golf Club for a week-end. So he signed his name one day on the register, and that afternoon played golf in a foursome with Mr. Hart and Mr. Sandwood and Mr. T. A. Hedrick. He did not consider it necessary to remark that he had once carried Mr. Hart's bag over this same links, and that he knew every trap and gully with his eyes shut--but he found himself glancing at the four caddies who trailed them, trying to catch a gleam or gesture that would remind him of himself, that would lessen the gap which lay between his present and his past.

It was a curious day, slashed abruptly with fleeting, familiar impressions. One minute he had the sense of being a trespasser--in the next he was impressed by the tremendous superiority he felt toward Mr. T. A. Hedrick, who was a bore and not even a good golfer any more.

Then, because of a ball Mr. Hart lost near the fifteenth green, an enormous thing happened. While they were searching the stiff grasses of the rough there was a clear call of ""Fore!"" from behind a hill in their rear. And as they all turned abruptly from their search a bright new ball sliced abruptly over the hill and caught Mr. T. A. Hedrick in the abdomen.

""By Gad!"" cried Mr. T. A. Hedrick, ""they ought to put some of these crazy women off the course. It's getting to be outrageous.""

A head and a voice came up together over the hill:

""Do you mind if we go through?""

""You hit me in the stomach!"" declared Mr. Hedrick wildly.

""Did I?"" The girl approached the group of men. ""I'm sorry. I yelled 'Fore !'""

Her glance fell casually on each of the men--then scanned the fairway for her ball.

""Did I bounce into the rough?""

It was impossible to determine whether this question was ingenuous or malicious. In a moment, however, she left no doubt, for as her partner came up over the hill she called cheerfully:

""Here I am! I'd have gone on the green except that I hit something.""

As she took her stance for a short mashie shot, Dexter looked at her closely. She wore a blue gingham dress, rimmed at throat and shoulders with a white edging that accentuated her tan. The quality of exaggeration, of thinness, which had made her passionate eyes and down-turning mouth absurd at eleven, was gone now. She was arrestingly beautiful. The color in her cheeks was centered like the color in a picture--it was not a ""high"" color, but a sort of fluctuating and feverish warmth, so shaded that it seemed at any moment it would recede and disappear. This color and the mobility of her mouth gave a continual impression of flux, of intense life, of passionate vitality--balanced only partially by the sad luxury of her eyes.

She swung her mashie impatiently and without interest, pitching the ball into a sand-pit on the other side of the green. With a quick, insincere smile and a careless ""Thank you!"" she went on after it.

""That Judy Jones!"" remarked Mr. Hedrick on the next tee, as they waited--some moments--for her to play on ahead. ""All she needs is to be turned up and spanked for six months and then to be married off to an oldfashioned cavalry captain.""

""My God, she's good-looking!"" said Mr. Sandwood, who was just over thirty.

""Good-looking!"" cried Mr. Hedrick contemptuously, ""she always looks as if she wanted to be kissed! Turning those big cow-eyes on every calf in town!""

It was doubtful if Mr. Hedrick intended a reference to the maternal instinct.

""She'd play pretty good golf if she'd try,"" said Mr. Sandwood.

""She has no form,"" said Mr. Hedrick solemnly.

""She has a nice figure,"" said Mr. Sandwood.

""Better thank the Lord she doesn't drive a swifter ball,"" said Mr. Hart, winking at Dexter.

Later in the afternoon the sun went down with a riotous swirl of gold and varying blues and scarlets, and left the dry, rustling night of Western summer. Dexter watched from the veranda of the Golf Club, watched the even overlap of the waters in the little wind, silver molasses under the harvest-moon. Then the moon held a finger to her lips and the lake became a clear pool, pale and quiet. Dexter put on his bathing-suit and swam out to the farthest raft, where he stretched dripping on the wet canvas of the springboard.

There was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. Over on a dark peninsula a piano was playing the songs of last summer and of summers before that-- songs from ""Chin-Chin"" and ""The Count of Luxemburg"" and ""The Chocolate Soldier""--and because the sound of a piano over a stretch of water had always seemed beautiful to Dexter he lay perfectly quiet and listened.

The tune the piano was playing at that moment had been gay and new five years before when Dexter was a sophomore at college. They had played it at a prom once when he could not afford the luxury of proms, and he had stood outside the gymnasium and listened. The sound of the tune precipitated in him a sort of ecstasy and it was with that ecstasy he viewed what happened to him now. It was a mood of intense appreciation, a sense that, for once, he was magnificently attune to life and that everything about him was radiating a brightness and a glamour he might never know again.

A low, pale oblong detached itself suddenly from the darkness of the Island, spitting forth the reverberate sound of a racing motor-boat. Two white streamers of cleft water rolled themselves out behind it and almost immediately the boat was beside him, drowning out the hot tinkle of the piano in the drone of its spray. Dexter raising himself on his arms was aware of a figure standing at the wheel, of two dark eyes regarding him over the lengthening space of water--then the boat had gone by and was sweeping in an immense and purposeless circle of spray round and round in the middle of the lake. With equal eccentricity one of the circles flattened out and headed back toward the raft.

""Who's that?"" she called, shutting off her motor. She was so near now that Dexter could see her bathing-suit, which consisted apparently of pink rompers.

The nose of the boat bumped the raft, and as the latter tilted rakishly he was precipitated toward her. With different degrees of interest they recognized each other.

""Aren't you one of those men we played through this afternoon?"" she demanded.

He was.

""Well, do you know how to drive a motor-boat? Because if you do I wish you'd drive this one so I can ride on the surf-board behind. My name is Judy Jones""--she favored him with an absurd smirk--rather, what tried to be a smirk, for, twist her mouth as she might, it was not grotesque, it was merely beautiful--""and I live in a house over there on the Island, and in that house there is a man waiting for me. When he drove up at the door I drove out of the dock because he says I'm his ideal.""

There was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. Dexter sat beside Judy Jones and she explained how her boat was driven. Then she was in the water, swimming to the floating surfboard with a sinuous crawl. Watching her was without effort to the eye, watching a branch waving or a sea-gull flying. Her arms, burned to butternut, moved sinuously among the dull platinum ripples, elbow appearing first, casting the forearm back with a cadence of falling water, then reaching out and down, stabbing a path ahead.

They moved out into the lake; turning, Dexter saw that she was kneeling on the low rear of the now uptilted surf-board.

""Go faster,"" she called, ""fast as it'll go.""

Obediently he jammed the lever forward and the white spray mounted at the bow. When he looked around again the girl was standing up on the rushing board, her arms spread wide, her eyes lifted toward the moon.

""It's awful cold,"" she shouted. ""What's your name?""

He told her.

""Well, why don't you come to dinner to-morrow night?""

His heart turned over like the fly-wheel of the boat, and, for the second time, her casual whim gave a new direction to his life.

III

NEXT EVENING while he waited for her to come down-stairs, Dexter peopled the soft deep summer room and the sun-porch that opened from it with the men who had already loved Judy Jones. He knew the sort of men they were--the men who when he first went to college had entered from the great prep schools with graceful clothes and the deep tan of healthy summers. He had seen that, in one sense, he was better than these men. He was newer and stronger. Yet in acknowledging to himself that he wished his children to be like them he was admitting that he was but the rough, strong stuff from which they eternally sprang.
When the time had come for him to wear good clothes, he had known who were the best tailors in America, and the best tailors in America had made him the suit he wore this evening. He had acquired that particular reserve peculiar to his university, that set it off from other universities. He recognized the value to him of such a mannerism and he had adopted it; he knew that to be careless in dress and manner required more confidence than to be careful. But carelessness was for his children. His mother's name had been Krimslich. She was a Bohemian of the peasant class and she had talked broken English to the end of her days. Her son must keep to the set patterns.

At a little after seven Judy Jones came down-stairs. She wore a blue silk afternoon dress, and he was disappointed at first that she had not put on something more elaborate. This feeling was accentuated when, after a brief greeting, she went to the door of a butler's pantry and pushing it open called: ""You can serve dinner, Martha."" He had rather expected that a butler would announce dinner, that there would be a cocktail. Then he put these thoughts behind him as they sat down side by side on a lounge and looked at each other.

""Father and mother won't be here,"" she said thoughtfully.

He remembered the last time he had seen her father, and he was glad the parents were not to be here to-night--they might wonder who he was. He had been born in Keeble, a Minnesota village fifty miles farther north, and he always gave Keeble as his home instead of Black Bear Village. Country towns were well enough to come from if they weren't inconveniently in sight and used as footstools by fashionable lakes.

They talked of his university, which she had visited frequently during the past two years, and of the near-by city which supplied Sherry Island with its patrons, and whither Dexter would return next day to his prospering laundries.

During dinner she slipped into a moody depression which gave Dexter a feeling of uneasiness. Whatever petulance she uttered in her throaty voice worried him. Whatever she smiled at--at him, at a chicken liver, at nothing--it disturbed him that her smile could have no root in mirth, or even in amusement. When the scarlet corners of her lips curved down, it was less a smile than an invitation to a kiss.

Then, after dinner, she led him out on the dark sun-porch and deliberately changed the atmosphere.

""Do you mind if I weep a little?"" she said.

""I'm afraid I'm boring you,"" he responded quickly.

""You're not. I like you. But I've just had a terrible afternoon. There was a man I cared about, and this afternoon he told me out of a clear sky that he was poor as a church-mouse. He'd never even hinted it before. Does this sound horribly mundane?""

""Perhaps he was afraid to tell you.""

""Suppose he was,"" she answered. ""He didn't start right. You see, if I'd thought of him as poor--well, I've been mad about loads of poor men, and fully intended to marry them all. But in this case, I hadn't thought of him that way, and my interest in him wasn't strong enough to survive the shock. As if a girl calmly informed her fianc_ that she was a widow. He might not object to widows, but----

""Let's start right,"" she interrupted herself suddenly. ""Who are you, anyhow?""

For a moment Dexter hesitated. Then:

""I'm nobody,"" he announced. ""My career is largely a matter of futures.""

""Are you poor?""

""No,"" he said frankly, ""I'm probably making more money than any man my age in the Northwest. I know that's an obnoxious remark, but you advised me to start right.""

There was a pause. Then she smiled and the corners of her mouth drooped and an almost imperceptible sway brought her closer to him, looking up into his eyes. A lump rose in Dexter's throat, and he waited breathless for the experiment, facing the unpredictable compound that would form mysteriously from the elements of their lips. Then he saw--she communicated her excitement to him, lavishly, deeply, with kisses that were not a promise but a fulfillment. They aroused in him not hunger demanding renewal but surfeit that would demand more surfeit . . . kisses that were like charity, creating want by holding back nothing at all.

It did not take him many hours to decide that he had wanted Judy Jones ever since he was a proud, desirous little boy.

IV

IT BEGAN like that--and continued, with varying shades of intensity, on such a note right up to the d_nouement. Dexter surrendered a part of himself to the most direct and unprincipled personality with which he had ever come in contact. Whatever Judy wanted, she went after with the full pressure of her charm. There was no divergence of method, no jockeying for position or premeditation of effects--there was a very little mental side to any of her affairs. She simply made men conscious to the highest degree of her physical loveliness. Dexter had no desire to change her. Her deficiencies were knit up with a passionate energy that transcended and justified them.
When, as Judy's head lay against his shoulder that first night, she whispered, ""I don't know what's the matter with me. Last night I thought I was in love with a man and to-night I think I'm in love with you----""--it seemed to him a beautiful and romantic thing to say. It was the exquisite excitability that for the moment he controlled and owned. But a week later he was compelled to view this same quality in a different light. She took him in her roadster to a picnic supper, and after supper she disappeared, likewise in her roadster, with another man. Dexter became enormously upset and was scarcely able to be decently civil to the other people present. When she assured him that she had not kissed the other man, he knew she was lying--yet he was glad that she had taken the trouble to lie to him.

He was, as he found before the summer ended, one of a varying dozen who circulated about her. Each of them had at one time been favored above all others--about half of them still basked in the solace of occasional sentimental revivals. Whenever one showed signs of dropping out through long neglect, she granted him a brief honeyed hour, which encouraged him to tag along for a year or so longer. Judy made these forays upon the helpless and defeated without malice, indeed half unconscious that there was anything mischievous in what she did.

When a new man came to town every one dropped out--dates were automatically cancelled.

The helpless part of trying to do anything about it was that she did it all herself. She was not a girl who could be ""won"" in the kinetic sense--she was proof against cleverness, she was proof against charm; if any of these assailed her too strongly she would immediately resolve the affair to a physical basis, and under the magic of her physical splendor the strong as well as the brilliant played her game and not their own. She was entertained only by the gratification of her desires and by the direct exercise of her own charm. Perhaps from so much youthful love, so many youthful lovers, she had come, in self-defense, to nourish herself wholly from within.

Succeeding Dexter's first exhilaration came restlessness and dissatisfaction. The helpless ecstasy of losing himself in her was opiate rather than tonic. It was fortunate for his work during the winter that those moments of ecstasy came infrequently. Early in their acquaintance it had seemed for a while that there was a deep and spontaneous mutual attraction that first August, for example--three days of long evenings on her dusky veranda, of strange wan kisses through the late afternoon, in shadowy alcoves or behind the protecting trellises of the garden arbors, of mornings when she was fresh as a dream and almost shy at meeting him in the clarity of the rising day. There was all the ecstasy of an engagement about it, sharpened by his realization that there was no engagement. It was during those three days that, for the first time, he had asked her to marry him. She said ""maybe some day,"" she said ""kiss me,"" she said ""I'd like to marry you,"" she said ""I love you""--she said-- nothing.

The three days were interrupted by the arrival of a New York man who visited at her house for half September. To Dexter's agony, rumor engaged them. The man was the son of the president of a great trust company. But at the end of a month it was reported that Judy was yawning. At a dance one night she sat all evening in a motor-boat with a local beau, while the New Yorker searched the club for her frantically. She told the local beau that she was bored with her visitor, and two days later he left. She was seen with him at the station, and it was reported that he looked very mournful indeed.

On this note the summer ended. Dexter was twenty-four, and he found himself increasingly in a position to do as he wished. He joined two clubs in the city and lived at one of them. Though he was by no means an integral part of the stag-lines at these clubs, he managed to be on hand at dances where Judy Jones was likely to appear. He could have gone out socially as much as he liked--he was an eligible young man, now, and popular with down-town fathers. His confessed devotion to Judy Jones had rather solidified his position. But he had no social aspirations and rather despised the dancing men who were always on tap for the Thursday or Saturday parties and who filled in at dinners with the younger married set. Already he was playing with the idea of going East to New York. He wanted to take Judy Jones with him. No disillusion as to the world in which she had grown up could cure his illusion as to her desirability.

Remember that--for only in the light of it can what he did for her be understood.

Eighteen months after he first met Judy Jones he became engaged to another girl. Her name was Irene Scheerer, and her father was one of the men who had always believed in Dexter. Irene was light-haired and sweet and honorable, and a little stout, and she had two suitors whom she pleasantly relinquished when Dexter formally asked her to marry him.

Summer, fall, winter, spring, another summer, another fall-- so much he had given of his active life to the incorrigible lips of Judy Jones. She had treated him with interest, with encouragement, with malice, with indifference, with contempt. She had inflicted on him the innumerable little slights and indignities possible in such a case--as if in revenge for having ever cared for him at all. She had beckoned him and yawned at him and beckoned him again and he had responded often with bitterness and narrowed eyes. She had brought him ecstatic happiness and intolerable agony of spirit. She had caused him untold inconvenience and not a little trouble. She had insulted him, and she had ridden over him, and she had played his interest in her against his interest in his work--for fun. She had done everything to him except to criticise him--this she had not done-- it seemed to him only because it might have sullied the utter indifference she manifested and sincerely felt toward him.

When autumn had come and gone again it occurred to him that he could not have Judy Jones. He had to beat this into his mind but he convinced himself at last. He lay awake at night for a while and argued it over. He told himself the trouble and the pain she had caused him, he enumerated her glaring deficiencies as a wife. Then he said to himself that he loved her, and after a while he fell asleep. For a week, lest he imagined her husky voice over the telephone or her eyes opposite him at lunch, he worked hard and late, and at night he went to his office and plotted out his years.

At the end of a week he went to a dance and cut in on her once. For almost the first time since they had met he did not ask her to sit out with him or tell her that she was lovely. It hurt him that she did not miss these things--that was all. He was not jealous when he saw that there was a new man to-night. He had been hardened against jealousy long before.

He stayed late at the dance. He sat for an hour with Irene Scheerer and talked about books and about music. He knew very little about either. But he was beginning to be master of his own time now, and he had a rather priggish notion that he--the young and already fabulously successful Dexter Green--should know more about such things.

That was in October, when he was twenty-five. In January, Dexter and Irene became engaged. It was to be announced in June, and they were to be married three months later.

The Minnesota winter prolonged itself interminably, and it was almost May when the winds came soft and the snow ran down into Black Bear Lake at last. For the first time in over a year Dexter was enjoying a certain tranquility of spirit. Judy Jones had been in Florida, and afterward in Hot Springs, and somewhere she had been engaged, and somewhere she had broken it off. At first, when Dexter had definitely given her up, it had made him sad that people still linked them together and asked for news of her, but when he began to be placed at dinner next to Irene Scheerer people didn't ask him about her any more--they told him about her. He ceased to be an authority on her.

May at last. Dexter walked the streets at night when the darkness was damp as rain, wondering that so soon, with so little done, so much of ecstasy had gone from him. May one year back had been marked by Judy's poignant, unforgivable, yet forgiven turbulence--it had been one of those rare times when he fancied she had grown to care for him. That old penny's worth of happiness he had spent for this bushel of content. He knew that Irene would be no more than a curtain spread behind him, a hand moving among gleaming tea-cups, a voice calling to children . . . fire and loveliness were gone, the magic of nights and the wonder of the varying hours and seasons . . . slender lips, down-turning, dropping to his lips and bearing him up into a heaven of eyes. . . . The thing was deep in him. He was too strong and alive for it to die lightly.

In the middle of May when the weather balanced for a few days on the thin bridge that led to deep summer he turned in one night at Irene's house. Their engagement was to be announced in a week now--no one would be surprised at it. And to-night they would sit together on the lounge at the University Club and look on for an hour at the dancers. It gave him a sense of solidity to go with her--she was so sturdily popular, so intensely ""great.""

He mounted the steps of the brownstone house and stepped inside.

""Irene,"" he called.

Mrs. Scheerer came out of the living-room to meet him.

""Dexter,"" she said, ""Irene's gone up-stairs with a splitting headache. She wanted to go with you but I made her go to bed.""

""Nothing serious, I----""

""Oh, no. She's going to play golf with you in the morning. You can spare her for just one night, can't you, Dexter?""

Her smile was kind. She and Dexter liked each other. In the living-room he talked for a moment before he said good-night.

Returning to the University Club, where he had rooms, he stood in the doorway for a moment and watched the dancers. He leaned against the door-post, nodded at a man or two--yawned.

""Hello, darling.""

The familiar voice at his elbow startled him. Judy Jones had left a man and crossed the room to him--Judy Jones, a slender enamelled doll in cloth of gold: gold in a band at her head, gold in two slipper points at her dress's hem. The fragile glow of her face seemed to blossom as she smiled at him. A breeze of warmth and light blew through the room. His hands in the pockets of his dinner-jacket tightened spasmodically. He was filled with a sudden excitement.

""When did you get back?"" he asked casually.

""Come here and I'll tell you about it.""

She turned and he followed her. She had been away--he could have wept at the wonder of her return. She had passed through enchanted streets, doing things that were like provocative music. All mysterious happenings, all fresh and quickening hopes, had gone away with her, come back with her now.

She turned in the doorway.

""Have you a car here? If you haven't, I have.""

""I have a coup_.""

In then, with a rustle of golden cloth. He slammed the door. Into so many cars she had stepped--like this--like that-- her back against the leather, so--her elbow resting on the door-- waiting. She would have been soiled long since had there been anything to soil her--except herself--but this was her own self outpouring.

With an effort he forced himself to start the car and back into the street. This was nothing, he must remember. She had done this before, and he had put her behind him, as he would have crossed a bad account from his books.

He drove slowly down-town and, affecting abstraction, traversed the deserted streets of the business section, peopled here and there where a movie was giving out its crowd or where consumptive or pugilistic youth lounged in front of pool halls. The clink of glasses and the slap of hands on the bars issued from saloons, cloisters of glazed glass and dirty yellow light.

She was watching him closely and the silence was embarrassing, yet in this crisis he could find no casual word with which to profane the hour. At a convenient turning he began to zigzag back toward the University Club.

""Have you missed me?"" she asked suddenly.

""Everybody missed you.""

He wondered if she knew of Irene Scheerer. She had been back only a day--her absence had been almost contemporaneous with his engagement.

""What a remark!"" Judy laughed sadly--without sadness. She looked at him searchingly. He became absorbed in the dashboard.

""You're handsomer than you used to be,"" she said thoughtfully. ""Dexter, you have the most rememberable eyes.""

He could have laughed at this, but he did not laugh. It was the sort of thing that was said to sophomores. Yet it stabbed at him.

""I'm awfully tired of everything, darling."" She called every one darling, endowing the endearment with careless, individual comraderie. ""I wish you'd marry me.""

The directness of this confused him. He should have told her now that he was going to marry another girl, but he could not tell her. He could as easily have sworn that he had never loved her.

""I think we'd get along,"" she continued, on the same note, ""unless probably you've forgotten me and fallen in love with another girl.""

Her confidence was obviously enormous. She had said, in effect, that she found such a thing impossible to believe, that if it were true he had merely committed a childish indiscretion-- and probably to show off. She would forgive him, because it was not a matter of any moment but rather something to be brushed aside lightly.

""Of course you could never love anybody but me,"" she continued. ""I like the way you love me. Oh, Dexter, have you forgotten last year?""

""No, I haven't forgotten.""

""Neither have I! ""

Was she sincerely moved--or was she carried along by the wave of her own acting?

""I wish we could be like that again,"" she said, and he forced himself to answer:

""I don't think we can.""

""I suppose not. . . . I hear you're giving Irene Scheerer a violent rush.""

There was not the faintest emphasis on the name, yet Dexter was suddenly ashamed.

""Oh, take me home,"" cried Judy suddenly; ""I don't want to go back to that idiotic dance--with those children.""

Then, as he turned up the street that led to the residence district, Judy began to cry quietly to herself. He had never seen her cry before.

The dark street lightened, the dwellings of the rich loomed up around them, he stopped his coup_ in front of the great white bulk of the Mortimer Joneses house, somnolent, gorgeous, drenched with the splendor of the damp moonlight. Its solidity startled him. The strong walls, the steel of the girders, the breadth and beam and pomp of it were there only to bring out the contrast with the young beauty beside him. It was sturdy to accentuate her slightness--as if to show what a breeze could be generated by a butterfly's wing.

He sat perfectly quiet, his nerves in wild clamor, afraid that if he moved he would find her irresistibly in his arms. Two tears had rolled down her wet face and trembled on her upper lip.

""I'm more beautiful than anybody else,"" she said brokenly, ""why can't I be happy?"" Her moist eyes tore at his stability--her mouth turned slowly downward with an exquisite sadness: ""I'd like to marry you if you'll have me, Dexter. I suppose you think I'm not worth having, but I'll be so beautiful for you, Dexter.""

A million phrases of anger, pride, passion, hatred, tenderness fought on his lips. Then a perfect wave of emotion washed over him, carrying off with it a sediment of wisdom, of convention, of doubt, of honor. This was his girl who was speaking, his own, his beautiful, his pride.

""Won't you come in?"" He heard her draw in her breath sharply.

Waiting.

""All right,"" his voice was trembling, ""I'll come in.

V

IT WAS STRANGE that neither when it was over nor a long time afterward did he regret that night. Looking at it from the perspective of ten years, the fact that Judy's flare for him endured just one month seemed of little importance. Nor did it matter that by his yielding he subjected himself to a deeper agony in the end and gave serious hurt to Irene Scheerer and to Irene's parents, who had befriended him. There was nothing sufficiently pictorial about Irene's grief to stamp itself on his mind.
Dexter was at bottom hard-minded. The attitude of the city on his action was of no importance to him, not because he was going to leave the city, but because any outside attitude on the situation seemed superficial. He was completely indifferent to popular opinion. Nor, when he had seen that it was no use, that he did not possess in himself the power to move fundamentally or to hold Judy Jones, did he bear any malice toward her. He loved her, and he would love her until the day he was too old for loving--but he could not have her. So he tasted the deep pain that is reserved only for the strong, just as he had tasted for a little while the deep happiness.

Even the ultimate falsity of the grounds upon which Judy terminated the engagement that she did not want to ""take him away"" from Irene--Judy, who had wanted nothing else--did not revolt him. He was beyond any revulsion or any amusement.

He went East in February with the intention of selling out his laundries and settling in New York--but the war came to America in March and changed his plans. He returned to the West, handed over the management of the business to his partner, and went into the first officers' training-camp in late April. He was one of those young thousands who greeted the war with a certain amount of relief, welcoming the liberation from webs of tangled emotion.

VI

THIS STORY is not his biography, remember, although things creep into it which have nothing to do with those dreams he had when he was young. We are almost done with them and with him now. There is only one more incident to be related here, and it happens seven years farther on.
It took place in New York, where he had done well--so well that there were no barriers too high for him. He was thirty-two years old, and, except for one flying trip immediately after the war, he had not been West in seven years. A man named Devlin from Detroit came into his office to see him in a business way, and then and there this incident occurred, and closed out, so to speak, this particular side of his life.

""So you're from the Middle West,"" said the man Devlin with careless curiosity. ""That's funny--I thought men like you were probably born and raised on Wall Street. You know--wife of one of my best friends in Detroit came from your city. I was an usher at the wedding.""

Dexter waited with no apprehension of what was coming.

""Judy Simms,"" said Devlin with no particular interest; ""Judy Jones she was once.""

""Yes, I knew her."" A dull impatience spread over him. He had heard, of course, that she was married--perhaps deliberately he had heard no more.

""Awfully nice girl,"" brooded Devlin meaninglessly, ""I'm sort of sorry for her.""

""Why?"" Something in Dexter was alert, receptive, at once.

""Oh, Lud Simms has gone to pieces in a way. I don't mean he ill-uses her, but he drinks and runs around ""

""Doesn't she run around?""

""No. Stays at home with her kids.""

""Oh.""

""She's a little too old for him,"" said Devlin.

""Too old!"" cried Dexter. ""Why, man, she's only twenty-seven.""

He was possessed with a wild notion of rushing out into the streets and taking a train to Detroit. He rose to his feet spasmodically.

""I guess you're busy,"" Devlin apologized quickly. ""I didn't realize----""

""No, I'm not busy,"" said Dexter, steadying his voice. ""I'm not busy at all. Not busy at all. Did you say she was-- twenty-seven? No, I said she was twenty-seven.""

""Yes, you did,"" agreed Devlin dryly.

""Go on, then. Go on.""

""What do you mean?""

""About Judy Jones.""

Devlin looked at him helplessly.

""Well, that's, I told you all there is to it. He treats her like the devil. Oh, they're not going to get divorced or anything. When he's particularly outrageous she forgives him. In fact, I'm inclined to think she loves him. She was a pretty girl when she first came to Detroit.""

A pretty girl! The phrase struck Dexter as ludicrous

""Isn't she--a pretty girl, any more?""

""Oh, she's all right.""

""Look here,"" said Dexter, sitting down suddenly, ""I don't understand. You say she was a 'pretty girl' and now you say she's 'all right.' I don't understand what you mean--Judy Jones wasn't a pretty girl, at all. She was a great beauty. Why, I knew her, I knew her. She was----""

Devlin laughed pleasantly.

""I'm not trying to start a row,"" he said. ""I think Judy's a nice girl and I like her. I can't understand how a man like Lud Simms could fall madly in love with her, but he did."" Then he added: ""Most of the women like her.""

Dexter looked closely at Devlin, thinking wildly that there must be a reason for this, some insensitivity in the man or some private malice.

""Lots of women fade just like that,"" Devlin snapped his fingers. ""You must have seen it happen. Perhaps I've forgotten how pretty she was at her wedding. I've seen her so much since then, you see. She has nice eyes.""

A sort of dulness settled down upon Dexter. For the first time in his life he felt like getting very drunk. He knew that he was laughing loudly at something Devlin had said, but he did not know what it was or why it was funny. When, in a few minutes, Devlin went he lay down on his lounge and looked out the window at the New York sky-line into which the sun was sinking in dull lovely shades of pink and gold.

He had thought that having nothing else to lose he was invulnerable at last--but he knew that he had just lost something more, as surely as if he had married Judy Jones and seen her fade away before his eyes.

The dream was gone. Something had been taken from him. In a sort of panic he pushed the palms of his hands into his eyes and tried to bring up a picture of the waters lapping on Sherry Island and the moonlit veranda, and gingham on the golf-links and the dry sun and the gold color of her neck's soft down. And her mouth damp to his kisses and her eyes plaintive with melancholy and her freshness like new fine linen in the morning. Why, these things were no longer in the world! They had existed and they existed no longer.

For the first time in years the tears were streaming down his face. But they were for himself now. He did not care about mouth and eyes and moving hands. He wanted to care, and he could not care. For he had gone away and he could never go back any more. The gates were closed, the sun was gone down, and there was no beauty but the gray beauty of steel that withstands all time. Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of illusion, of youth, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished.

""Long ago,"" he said, ""long ago, there was something in me, but now that thing is gone. Now that thing is gone, that thing is gone. I cannot cry. I cannot care. That thing will come back no more.""",F. Scott Fitzgerald,1988,"[81, 81, 98]",3

Don't ask me what you know is true
Don't have to tell you, oh, I love your precious heart

I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collide

Two worlds collided

83,Perfect,"[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight",Ed Sheeran,1988,"[86, 86, 95]",3

But some would say I’m awful/
Some stay away/
Others follow like apostles/
Some days I slay/
The others I’m a lost soul/
I got cold feet/
Thoughtful as I be/
My thoughts my enemy/
Attacking my self-esteem/
Pretend to be a century old/
With nothing but wisdom/
But truth be told/
I know less than some kids man/
Hidden in these lines/
A story I ain’t tellin/
My girl quella/
Taking her to d-ville/
Devil, that’s what I be/
In the city of g-ville/
Shouting are you listening?/
And then everything go quiet/
And I hear my own echo/ echo/

So Imma take it slow/
And try and live forever/

And burning up they necks/
And wondering what’s next/
Stomach churning/
So uncertain/
Is it worth it/
Is it worthless/
Is it gifts/

Serving pertinent sermons/
About a singular purpose/

Just trying to be the master/

85,Don't Be Cruel,"[Verse 1]
Girl, the only thing that matters in my life
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no cause to treat me cold as ice

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

[Chorus]
Don't be cruel, 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh don't be cruel

[Verse 2]
Hey, yo, cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was being real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high-post but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my heart to you
You should be giving me your heart too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you twelve yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl is like a heart attack
I'm a real troop trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side, d-dollars I will clock

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool (Hoo)

Don't be cruel
I know, oh

[Verse 4]
We used to hang out tough, just kicking around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Lo to the fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', trying to make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willing
To be with me, Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be, and if you wanna be with me

I see a memory
Of how it used to be
Before our world came tumbling down

I try
I did nothing else
But try to keep our love alive

Did you deceive me?
Did you do me wrong?
Boy, I can`t take it
Can`t take it anymore

I feel so helpless
Not knowing what to do
Do I keep on crying?
Or do I leave you?

Boy, I`ve been told

It would be easy
If I didn`t want to start anew

Boy, I`ve been told
Leaving you is the thing to do
It won`t be easy
Cause breaking up is hard to do

Touch this lonely heart
As I try to say to you
About the things you do

You were never good for me

90,I'll Always Love You,"Standing by my window, listening for your call
Guess I really miss you after all
Time won't let me keep these sad thoughts to myself
I'd just like to let you know, I wish I'd never let you go

And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you
And I'll always need you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will love you

Wish you'd never left me but love's a mystery
You can break a heart so easily
The days and nights reveal how much I feel for you
Time has come for me to see how much your love has meant to me

And I'll always love you
And if you ever change your mind
I'll still, I will love you

Time like a river keeps on rollin' right on by
Nothing left for me to do
So I watch the river rise

And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine
I do love you
And I'll always need you

92,Posse On Broadway,"[Verse 1]
Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz limo with the cellular phone
I'm calling up the posse it's time to get rippin
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin
Everybody's looking if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumping but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rolling Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this sucka mc's wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Heading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back
Maharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass, the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 2]
Rollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot a money
Clocking lots a dollars, we all got gold
Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go
Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs
Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop
The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best
She's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 3]
Cruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rolling with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was looking for a ride
We tried to pick em up but we had no room inside
We put em on the trunk we put em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks
My muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak
Now the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip
They said, ""Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's""
Dick's is the place were the cool hang out
The swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
We're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace
Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us
With him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes
You're broke cold crying about the rock man blues
Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset

93,Any Love,"[Verse 1]
You go out every night as a single
But you don't really know what to do
You see someone that you'd like to mingle
And imagine that she is waiting for you

[Chorus]
Any love that you feel, is real
Any time that you use love, you lose love

[Verse 2]
There is no certain crowd that you run with
But your passions they never run thin
You say 'hi', they say 'hi' and it's done with
Still you don't really love from deep within

[Chorus]
Any love that you feel, is real
Any time that you use love, you lose love

[Bridge]
Batted eyes and bitter tears
Price you pay for all the years
Of holding back what's deep inside
And living with a hell of a lot of lies

[Chorus]
Any love that you feel, is real
Any time that you use love, you lose love",Rufus,1988,"[96, 96, 96, 71, 62, 50, 46, 44, 50, 54, 64, 70, 78]",13

[Verse 1: Tigra]
It was me and the posse with bunny d
We were cruising in the Jags or the Lamborghinis
When lo and behold, there appeared a mirage
He was hooking up a car in his daddy's garage
We stopped short, did a double take
He was looking so fine I thought I wasn't awake
He was obviously hooking up bass I assumed
But then he turned the little button and the car went boom

[Hook: both]
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom

[Verse 2: Bunny]
We like them short and we like them tall
We like them one and we like them all
They're always adding speakers when they find the room
Cause they know we love the guys with the cars that go boom
And see my boyfiend really knows where it's at
He's got 50 inch woofers all along the back
He makes a comment on going to my room
But I rather stay out with his car that goes boom

[Hook]
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom

[Tigra:]
Now if your car ain't got it
Go out and get it
[Bunny:]
We like the boom
And don't you forget it
[Tigra:]
So turn down the treble
And flaunt your bass
[Bunny:]
So your car could be heard
Almost any place
[Tigra:]
Cause a banger in the street
He can't go far

Without hearing the boom
Pouring out your car
[Tigra:]
Yo if your speakers' weak
Then please turn it off

Cause we like the cars
That's down so tough

Here I am in silence

How can our love grow?

I wanna know what you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide

That what you say is true

I want to be
A day to give
The best of me

Is yet unknown

Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands

If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine

See no evil, fear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil
If you don't bring that shit around you
You ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Know what I'm saying?
Yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1]
Carolyn from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Keys of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her ice fro, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit
She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually bumped into her shopping for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me to do her dirty work

[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

[Verse 2]
Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home
From Attica, known for keeping chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years planning to blow soon as he hit the bridicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbing niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Laying with his bitch, 'niggas is rich' is what he told her
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, 6 shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash

[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world..""), you get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world, watch what you do.. (""It's a.. small world.."")

[Verse 3]
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull
Another thug died, pitching your soul into that infinite
Black hole where many souls go cause of a .44 blast
Snook was one of ‘em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85
He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God, he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on
And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing
Out the way as my Taurus spray
Jump in the whip, hit the highway
You know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never
'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar

[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a.. small world.."")
Nigga you reap what you sow
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a.. small world.."")

103,Don't You Know What The Night Can Do?,"Hear the night music playing?
Don't you know what it's saying?
We should feel it together
Forever

Feel the beat and just hold on
To the sweet midnight flowing
Feel the music inside you
I'll be there too

Now's the time our dreams are finally coming true
Feels so good we're crying
Now's the time when it's down to me and you
Spread these wings, we'll be flying

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Time to show all your feeling
All the night is revealing
Let the rhythm enfold you
Let me hold you

Now we turn into music
Now we will never lose it
When the rhythm and night ride
No heart can hide

There are times that never ever come again
Memories there for the making
When the night calls, we better let it in
All this love for the taking

Don't you know when it's touching you?
Won't you help me to let it through?

104,A Word In Spanish,"[Verse 1]
I don't know why
I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen

[Chorus]
And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish

[Verse 2]
If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist

[Pr-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue

105,Didn't Know It Was Love,"It felt so easy in the morning sun
When love was in season I was on the run
I was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chase
Love was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to face
One touch should've told me, try and understand
Love was always a long shot to a gambling man
With a roll of the dice, girl I threw it away
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day

*Didn't know it was love
Didn't know it was fate
Didn't know it was destiny callin'
Tell me it's never too late
Was I too blind to see
When push came to shove
You were all that I needed
Didn't know it was love*

Wasn't blind to the magic, you think I'm so tough
Turning back on the thunder just ain't good enough
I keep trying to shake you, there just ain't no way
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day

(* Repeat)

Those crazy nights on the borderline
Did my best to cut myself free
Stood alone, just a prisoner
Never knew you were holdin' the key

You don't have to take this
In the spaces and between
Sadness on their faces

I can see the chains of love
The chains
Talking 'bout the chains of love
Can't take us away

Storms are brewing in your heart
I don't wanna waste it
Better to have tried it all
Least we got to taste it

Locked up in the chains of love
We change
Caught up in the chains of love
Can't take us away

Clouds moving over the house
I think about those days
Wish I had something to relax my mind
Send me off to heaven
I've got nothing but time

Lightning in the sky above
Blinking, see the traces
Everything you are to me
Is bigger than the spaces

I'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me
I'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me
I'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me
I wanna feel it, no mercy
I reminisce you, I'm gonna go there

'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you
Baby I-I, I'm gonna miss you

Most nights I try to stay away from any memory
From those nights when you were still sleepin', dreamin' next to me
But I'm 'bout to put on continue and slow dance in this burnin' room

I'm gonna think about Charleston, weekend Airbnb
And that Carolina heat had nothin' on you and me
I'm gonna think about that first kiss in the rain, it was June
Remember how we said forever? I'm gonna think about that too

Where everythin' was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
An' pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

He's watchin' people, everywhere

And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am

I believe in music
I believe in magic
And I believe in you

What's going on with you and me

I don't believe virginity
Is as common as it used to be

Are still alive in Hollywood

And Rose was going to fall

And she was always falling
From somewhere very high
She blazed across the sky
Into water, into fire

And there was once a boy
Or maybe more than once
Twice upon a time
Not his time – out of time, any time
But every single time

We can call him Jack
Should we ever call
Twice and maybe more
Nimble Jack, quickly Jack, every Jack
And Jack will catch the Rose

And he will stop her falling
And he will hold her heart
And she will do her part
Time and tide, and over years

And Jack will kiss the Rose
Once and only once
But every single time
Not our time, into time, out of time
Twice upon a time

And after it was over
When she knew Jack was lost
Rose lived, he paid the cost –
Oh, after it was over
And oh, the Rose's tears
Sweet daughter of the years

Carry him through all your years

So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt

If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No, oh
Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the back-up

118,True Love,"[Verse 1]
On that first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me, please, and never let me go
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said ""I love you"" and meant it, oh
On the fourth, we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah
You are my true love

[Verse 2]
On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
Ain't nothin' shining more than you, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million, oh-oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love

120,If You Feel It,"There's an overtone, I can feel it
When you're near me, that's so appealing
You're always makin' my imagination
Think about you, in fascination

Don't wanna be alone and thinkin' 'bout the two of us
You've got to tell me if this tendency is amorous
Magnetic fields are pulling me in your direction
And if you take me there, I'll make you no objection

Don't hesitate, If you feel it, If you feel it
My love can't wait, If you feel it, If you feel it
Just let it be, If you feel it, If you feel it
Take all of me, If you feel it, If you feel it

When we're together, something radiates
My heart first skips a beat, and then accelerates
It must be something, to do with fusion
But I let you draw your own conclusion

We're wasting time if you insist on being so shy
And you should know by now I only wanna satisfy
I don't know any way for you to miss my meaning
There ain't no question anymore which way I'm leaning

Don't hesitate, If you feel it, If you feel it
My love can't wait, If you feel it, If you feel it
Just let it be, If you feel it, If you feel it
Take all of me, If you feel it, If you feel it

If you feel it, If you feel it

Love can wait
Feel it, Feel it
Satisfy

We're wasting time if you insist on being so shy
And you should know by now I only wanna satisfy
I don't know any way for you to miss my meaning
There ain't no question anymore which way I'm leaning

Yeah, find the scene & work it brother
Moving through sound

Overgrown and living undercover
Wound up so tight

We love the downtown life
Driftin' through the day
Waiting for the night, oh
Downtown life it feels so right
It keeps me hangin' on

Velvet Lou was a neighbor of mine
Now he walks the dog in Jersey, brother
Yuppies in black doin' white-collar crime
They scared away the local color
But they can't steal the night

We love the downtown life

Waiting for the night, oh
Downtown life it feels so right
It keeps me hangin' on

Downtown life
Drifting through the night
Waiting for the light to come
Downtown life it feels so right
It keeps me hangin' on

My baby knows she's got to go for this kind of life
'Cause city love can't stand to see the sunlight
Dawn patrol better leave me alone
'Cause I can only take it for so long
Going down isn't hard to do
The king of clubs and queen of hearts fall too
She says, ""If you believe this is only a lonely time
Stay at home, boys - the blues are lost on you""
Ain't it true

We love the downtown life
Drifting through the day
Waiting for the night, oh
Downtown life it feels so right

Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you

Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast

Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg

Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded

123,One Good Woman,"I been a traveler for more than too few years
I learned my lessons...I stilled my fears
My sole possessions--they steer me through it all
Sweet dreams and innocence--the cushion my falls
Feel the passion run you blind
See the vision dancin' in my mind

One good woman, who's all of what she seems
One good woman to share my dreams
One good woman--put all the games aside
One good woman--make the most of our lives

We live a life of fact and fantasy
We alter circumstance to fit our needs
We gain in fortune, but we lose in time
One door will open and one will close behind
Find the loner from the pack
Storm the mansions--I ain't never turnin' back

One good woman...she's all I hope to find
One good woman--think of me in kind
One good woman..she won't get me down
One good woman--turn my head around

Keepin' her distance..but oh she don't let go
One good woman...she makes it so
Over the air-waves, or across the sea
One good woman...she's more than enough for me",Billy Squier,1988,"[92, 80, 53, 37, 24, 11, 5, 4, 7, 11, 14, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 47, 72]",18

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin-a?
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin'
To look sexy, but even if she was, so what?
Motherfucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that let's me know that she's a human being
And being human's hard—on the boulevard
Girl, you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm André, Benjamin André to be exact
You'd hope to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced us at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes, you're getting booed if your shit do not get down
And yes, you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your Speakerboxxx?
""Pink and Blue"", you're lollygaggin', you're slow pokin'
You got me open, you're playin' wit me, darlin I'm not a toy

And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
That means find another face to replace cause I can't wait

130,Fallen Angel,"[Verse 1]
Hi Depression
How yea been??
It's been a long time, we meet again

I've been good
The fuck you been up to though?
Lately you look like your unstoppable
You must just not of check your messages
I've been trying to get to you desperately
It's time you came and pay your debt to me

I just want to be left in peace
Why the fuck you gotta mess with me?
So sick and tired of you testing me
Don't get to smile. Don't get to sleep

Sounds like you just need stress relief
Cut yourself or maybe take some pills
Cause nobody cares if you die or live
A waste of space, another useless soul
The world is better ... if you just go

Why you an asshole?
Making it easy?
As long as I'm breathing, my family needs me!

Give it a week and they'll forget your gone
Forget your name, forget your songs
You think you're loved but that's a lie
I cross my heart and I hope you die
You can't cope with this
You can't cope with change
You got knots to tie
You got ropes to hang

But what do I do when I can't get a job
And I can't get the fuck out my house?
I'm loosing it slowly my life is unfolding
And this isn't what I'm about!

Whoa
Tone it down. You're going to bust a vein
It's just your fate this isn’t just a phase
I'm drawn to you and you belong to me
I hope you see now that you're stuck with me

[Chorus]
The voice inside your head I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will make you...
Just another fallen angel

[verse 2]
Get the fuck out of my head!!!

Heha! Hey! Hold up man
I'm not done with you!
I'm going to do what I'm going to do!

Fuck this shit I'm not comfortable!
All I ever do is run from you!
I can't except this, I crave acceptance
I stay expecting the same exact thing
The same rejection, The same deflection
The same infection, My brain's defective!

Don't you want to come and play with me?
We can see the world, at least a darker side of it?
I got in and left a mark inside your head
I'm not leaving until the heart comes out of your chest
Heh, I've seen your soul it isn't worth you keeping it
And your incompleteness is what's been completing me

[Chorus]
The voice inside your head - I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will make you...
Just another fallen angel

[Verse 3]
Get the fuck out of my head!!!

I see dark on the brightest day
I fight the pain, I just want to gain some confidence
Locked in the mother-fucking box on top is a rock
I don't know how I got in this
(I do) Fuck you, fuck everyone else and the whole world!
I've been on the edge and I'm unsure
I have been feeling like something is building inside of me
Killing me slowly, I feel like I'm dying and I've been trying to deal with the stress
Life is a mess! I wish I was blessed! I wish I was...

Dead

Maybe you're right

You know that I'm right

I'm sick of my life

You're sick of your life?
Well come with me now
We could end it tonight
We could end it tonight

[Chorus]
The voice inside your head I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will take you
You could be my fallen angel",Mass of Man,1988,"[95, 77, 49, 32, 21, 12, 16, 18, 21, 25, 32, 38, 41, 51, 64, 73]",16
131,A Nightmare On My Street,"[Intro: Fresh Prince]
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare; on my street!

[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]
It was a Saturday evening, if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and bum rush the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
We saw Elm Street and man it was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

[Verse 2: Fresh Prince & Freddy Kruger]
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside in my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do, we got a lot of work here, me and you
The souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brain""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest, man, this team won't work
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
I pat him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

[Outro: Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff & Freddy Krueger]
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man
Hello?

Yeah, intergalactic, out of my mind and into traffic
In a pair of Converse, tryna' climb Mount Everest with nothin' in my backpack
It’s me: A son of a bitch, a child of a prick
A stepson you don’t wanna hit
Ooo wee, no, not him, not Lil Wayne, Michael Wayne
Who you thought it would be?
Damn right, and I’m on a tightrope
Screaming out loud, ""Bitch, fuck my life!""
I ain’t never give a fuck, I could never give a fuck now
So put the chain on my bike, yeah
Throw that bitch back on the sprocket, give me the pistol before you cock it
Let me throw a bullet in the clip for luck, for us
Poor us, yeah popping these, shocking, ain’t it mane?
Well, I guess nobody wants to be broke, right? Black or white
Paint the frame
‘Cause I’m only used to refusing the stereotypes of a name
I ain’t a name; I’m a soul, I’m a piece of gold
I’m a pro, I’m a piece of shit too
Do what I gotta do if I gotta roll, Guess what?
I’mma roll all over you, when I’m riding

Dude, I’m way out, I’m talking way out

[Verse 2]
Used to watch my beeper chirp, blue dickies and a black Raiders Shirt
My world was a little-bitty spot in the universe outside of Earth
Tennessee bound, Alabama born, I came down in a meteor storm
Media wrong, media write, right ‘em a wrong, ring the alarm
Duck under your desk, children go, this building is about to blow
I don’t know what I’mma do with this feeling inside of my mind and soul
I’m a one-in-a-million human show
Should've been the motherfucking Truman Show
But if you seen me getting raped as a child
You probably wouldn’t give me room to grow
Heavy blow, take a heavy sigh
Like a runner on the daily, he's high, oh my
We’ll be good, baby boy, don’t cry
I can make a boat with a book of rhymes
God made me the Cherokee like no
I can’t let the world off the hook this time
And if you didn’t want this Catfish shit
Then bitch, you should've never shook that line
Readied that hook, took this time, to press play then rewind
I would rather be drunk than be blind
To the space-age pimp shit that I combine
With what I know, rock-and-roll
I’m so famous, Country Fresh
That I can’t take one step in the fuckin’ street when I’m in public
So I get in them...

[Chorus]
Cinnamon seats, bass boat flakes, yeah, sprayed out
Drunk as a fool, throwing that Jim Beam back until I’m laid out

133,Strangelove,"[Verse 1]
There'll be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable

But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove, that's how my love goes
Strangelove, will you give it to me?

[Post-Chorus]
Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it?

[Verse 2]
There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach

I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach

And caress her like a man should do

She's so very close
But like every illusion
That's just how it appears

I reach out to touch
And find out there's no one there
Right now I'm going to close my eyes
And go back to where I need to be

Maybe then I'll get to hear her say
She loves me
And will never leave

[Chorus:]
She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my life

She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind

She's in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
Smack dib in the middle of my mind

[Bridge:]
Night and day
I want to kiss her lips
And caress her like a man should do
She's become the center of my emotions
And I can't fight through

[Chorus:]
She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
Smack dib in the middle of my mind

She's on the left
She's on the right
She's in the middle of my mind

She's on the left

141,I Did It For Love,"Before you dismiss
A case such as this
I'd like to say a few words, listen
Don't you resist
I did it for love
What more can I say
I only hope you'll understand my plea someday

Don't hold me to blame
I'm a little insane
And I'm growing more and more every day
I'll never get out
And no one gets in
To this cold, secluded world you put me in

Yeah, understand my motivation
It's not infatuation
Baby
Oh baby

You were the witness, you be the judge
I did it for love
I don't question you, your honour
I did it for love
I did it for love
What more can I say
I only hope you'll understand my plea someday

Understand my motivation
I'm reaching saturation
Baby
Oh baby

You were the witness, you be the judge
I did it for love
I don't question you, your honour
I did it for love
I did it for love
What more can I say

142,It Would Take A Strong Strong Man,"My heart starts breaking
When I think of making
A plan to let you go
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow
I'm gonna let you know
But I when I think about leaving
I think about losing
The only love I ever knew
Every time I think of you

My heart starts aching
My hands keep shaking
And you know, you know, you know

It would take a strong, strong man
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)
To ever let you go

My heart's been hurting
When I see you flirting
Every night out on the floor
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow
You'll grow to love me more
But whenever we're together
I could leave you never
Even though you treat me cruel
Every time I look at you

My heart starts aching
My hands keep shaking
And you know, you know, you know
It would take a strong, strong man
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)
To ever let you go

I tried to resist you
When you're gone, all I ever do is miss you
Anyone in love would know
Anyone with half a heart
Could never let you go

But I, when I think about leaving
I think about losing
The only girl I ever loved
Can't you tell me why do you hurt me
I guess some people never see
Especially a fool like me

Yo, Gravediggaz, man
Cuz we want to dig up the graves of the mentally dead
We just was lamping around one day, youknowhatimsaying
We was at Paul house, right (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And we was trynna find a word that could describe our way of thinking
And um, Gravedigga was the only thing that can really express it
And describe our thinking

Oooh-ooh! The call of the wilds, the black cats
On attack, and smack ya with a grizz' jaw back
Suffering effects of years of oppress'
Got ya running scared cuz the way that I'm dressed
Gravediggaz, the battle with the snakes
Spooks taking off cuz the force is awake
Hah, and now I'm on ya back like a rash
Run, run, yo, but you can't run from the blast
Looking for my window, and death, yo, here's a text
A threat is a black Gravedigga that can flex
If you can, come upon a land with the creep
Watch how they sneak when you walk down the street
Look over your shoulder, who's that the villain
The monkey on your brown with the pitchfork that
Catch you off guard, cuz you six foot deep
In the heart, heart, so don't be afraid of the dark

[Craig G.]
Aiyo, I am not afraid, I am not afraid, no I'm not afraid
When I walk, cops follow like a raid
Ducking, they be dipping, disappearing like a swami
Plus I'm extra scared cuz you voted Guiliani
In the office, you don't wanna caucus with me
In the elevator, so you hid the excelerator
And you walk, but I still follow like a hawk
Just to spite you and your racist thoughts
Plus patrolmen and taxi drivers are alike
Patrolmen pull you over and the taxi's make you hype
But I'm fine, my rhymes, could put your kids through college
So I don't really listen to your brain washed garbage
Nappy headed ones, coming through, hit the mark

I ricochet like bing-bing-bing, here comes the Grym
Your shit is fictionary, you a sick already
Look up up nigga, as you pick your dictionary
I'll let your eyes bulge out at the fact
That nigga is not a synonym meaning black
When the creator said let there be light
It means it was black, before that, there was night
And I am not afraid of the dark
But you could be, maybe, you should be
Cuz of the youth, the blood that you spill
In a country you help, now you worry you might bet killed
By the grand son's and daughters of those you offend

Yeah, it's so hard to find o lover
Okay the boys are getting better
But they still fall down under
Close examination, baby
It used to be essential
But that was purely elemental
Investigations always led to
One way conversations
It took me a little while to get
Myself acquainted
It just about ready for the
Right inspiration...c'mon now

Heart don't fail me now
Could he be the one I've waited for...
Oh yeah
Could he be the one being that
I miss around here
He could be the one...
He could be the one...

I wake up every morning
Inside my private little jewel box
It's not so bad to be alone
Don't want no substitution...
I'd rather be alone than with someone and lonely
It'd take a lot more
Than strong arms to hold me...c'mon now...

I had to look up when I saw you
And almost being struck by lightning
Staring at the light of the stars
It's like looking in the mirror
Just before the dawn, it's the darkest
So if this what you are then you're honest
Everything is in on the outside
Clap as the sun goes down
Clap as the sun goes down

[Chorus 1]
When the world stops spinnin' around
And gravity brings you down, don't give in
When the weight's too much to bare
And nobody seems to care, don't give in
Throw your hands to heaven

Look at what we've started
Everything comes from something
Love from pain, hope from hate and life from the rain

I'm not waiting, I'm drowning
And the elements won't give in, don't give in

Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again
My motivation, an oath I've sworn to defend
To win the honor of coming back home again
No explanation will matter after we begin
Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried within
My true vocation and now my unfortunate friend
You will discover a war you're unable to win

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll have you know that I've become

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable
Every broken enemy will know
That their opponent tend to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

[Verse 2]
Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now, for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect
I carry out my orders without a regret
A declaration embedded deep under my skin
A permanent reminder of how it began
No hesitation when I am commanded to strike
You need to know that you're in for the fight of your life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You will be shown how I've become

Indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable

That their opponent tend to be invincible
Take a last look around while you're alive
I'm an indestructible master of war

I'm indestructible
Determination that is incorruptible
From the other side a terror to behold
Annihilation will be unavoidable

150,Perfect World,"[Verse 1]
Talked to my dad on the phone today
He broke down and apologized
Said he sorry for the way things got fucked up
And he wished he did a better job
Couldn’t see his face but I could hear his watered eyes
I could hear him loud and clear; wonder what am I?
Understand me, I just want to see him try
But he didn’t want to see us, so he just shut his eyes
Told him don’t sweat it I’m good, I’m fine
Your childhood was no harder than mine
I know he’s your dad but motherfuck my grandpa and the daughters that he victimized
And the way that he treated his sons when your brother was alive
Once upon a time
And I know that you still don’t believe in the way that he died
Honestly neither do I but we just comply
Nod our head, move on
Brand new city, new wife, new mom
All those days you whooped my ass
Those same nights I wished you gone
So I hid in the bathroom and I wrote my first song without a beat
Hid the dirty clothes underneath the crack in the door
So you couldn’t ever see my feet
Let the water run so you couldn’t hear my voice
Hid the notebook so you never ever knew
Song after song, page after page, day after day
Writin' songs about you
So when you say that you proud of me now
Can’t explain what that means
We are who we are because of that shit
So no, I don’t want to be

[Chorus]
In a perfect world
Where nothin’ ever goes wrong
Far, far away from here, no
Water from the tears I
Wonder how they ever grow
In a perfect world
Where nothin’ ever goes wrong
Far, far away from here, no
Water from the tears I
Wonder how they ever grow

[Verse 2]
Talked to my big bro-bro today
He broke down and apologized
Said he’s sorry for the way things got fucked up
And he wish he did a better job
As he rolled up a blunt of some medical pine
Lit it, but he didn’t want to hit it this time
Hands started shakin' and then he started cryin'
Shit had been building in the pit of his mind
He said, ""I wish I never robbed my brothers""
""I wish I never robbed those bitches""
Now any time somebody can’t find they shit
And they can’t find me, then I’m suspicious
Don’t nobody think I’m sufficient
And my time is ticking
I wish I never dropped out of school
Now it's either sell dope or wash them dishes
I said look my friend, my dawg
I know you feel lost and that’s real (true)
But you wouldn’t want to feel warmer inside if you never had gotten them chills (true)
Could you save your son from fallin’ this far if you don’t know how that shit feels?
If Anthony never OD'd and died then I would prolly still be poppin' pills
Rest his soul, we are who we are
You don’t enjoy thinkin' back that far
This shit wasn’t easy, most times it was hard
But the darkest of nights make the brightest of stars
So be the light in the dark, fuck bein' the norm
Some days I wish it was easier too, but shit we were not born

[Chorus]
In a perfect world
Where nothing ever goes wrong
Far, far away from me, no

How many secrets can you keep?

Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts

I don't want to live without your love
I just want to live my life with you

Guess I had to go away
So much I had to go through
Guess I had to lose you

Burn a little stronger?

I can't be alone now any longer

I want to be in love with you forever

[Verse 1]
Forget about the childish doubts
My silence when we talk about
You going somewhere without me
'Cause every Sunday evening time
You pack your bags and we leave mine
And I purposely leave late
And hope your bus comes early

[Chorus]
But there's so many things that'll stop us from staying together
But I want to be in love with you forever

[Verse 2]
If I drew up a contract, would you sign
And agree to share your life with mine
Or would the romance die in that split second?
I want to stay in this paradise
Quoting you lyrics every night
Not telling you which ones that I wrote myself
About the—

Oh so many things that'll stop us from staying together
But I want to be in love with you forever
Yes I want to be in love with you forever

155,Fast Car,"[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself, I got nothing to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

[Verse 3]
See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or, live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights, lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I, could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bars
See more your friends than you do your kids
I always hoped for better
That maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk

Anywhere I'd know his face
In this city, the kid's my favorite
I've seen him, seen him
I see him every day

I've seen him run outside
Looking for a place to hide
From his father, the kid half-naked
And I said to myself
""Oh, what's the matter here?""

He's their kid, I stay out of it

I hear them every day

Slap you
Slap you silly,"" made me say, ""Hey, hey, hey

I'll take this belt from around my waist
And don't you think that I won't use it!""

Answer me and take your time
What could be the awful crime
He could do at so young an age?

If I'm the only witness to your madness
Offer me some words to balance out
What I see and what I hear

All these cold and rude things that you do
I suppose you do because he belongs to you
And instead of love and the feel of warmth
You've given him these cuts and sores
That don't heal with time or with age

To say yeah

168,"Powerful Stuff (From ""Cocktail"")","THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of Emergency Medicine confirms it: Each year, between one and two dozen adult US males are admitted to ERs after having castrated themselves. With kitchen tools, usually, sometimes wire cutters. In answer to the obvious question, surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety. The desire for perfect release and the real-world impossibility of perfect, whenever-you-want-it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand.

It is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: “Stop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!” Because we believe we may have found an alternative.

Every spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs’ notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV’s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it’s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clichés of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.—the whole cynical postmodern deal—but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there’s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there’s still joy. That we think it’s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.

Your correspondents humbly offer an alternative.

Every January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.

Though the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter’s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA’s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood’s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream’s Big Red Son.

It is no accident that Adult Video News—a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials—and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early ’80s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.

From the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):

- The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year’s awards show, commemorating AVN’s 15th anniversary, celebrates “History”. [sic]

- Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.

- The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 “new” releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3

- By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic—meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].

From the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN’s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): “I want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.” [Laughter, cheers, ovation.]

From the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN’s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black’s Miscreants: “Jesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that’s another one where I read the script and said ‘Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that’s okay, ’cause all my friends’ll be there too!” [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]

From the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: “I know I’m looking good, though, like younger, ’cause I started using this special Grecian Formula—every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That’s a great joke. Fuck you.”

Bobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as “the woman I’m going to cut my dick off for,” and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we’d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The ’98 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he’s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men’s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998’s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men’s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them—whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth—laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.

… But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday’s climax.

The adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards’ categories is “Best Anal Themed Feature”; another is “Best Overall Marketing Campaign—Company Image.” Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry’s not only vulgar, it’s predictably vulgar. All the clichés are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who’s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone.

But of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum’s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.

Thirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN’s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.

An LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn’s yearly gross.

As you know if you’ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion’s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the “Old Vegas,” centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas’s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it’s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more “family-oriented” venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.

But Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip’s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah’s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny’s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK—WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra’s sandbox. Most of them built in the ’50s and ’60s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World’s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally’s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange—of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow’s abstract cost.

Nor let us forget Vegas’s synecdoche and beating heart. It’s kittycorner from Bally’s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It’s breathtaking. The winter’s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas’s Caesars for modern porn’s Awards show—here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you’d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn’t miss a trick.

The Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It’s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS’s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year’s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents’ hometowns. It’s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from “The First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch” to the world’s premier self-heating home satellite dish (“The Snow and Ice Solution!”).

But far and away the CES’s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer’s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn’s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night’s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies’ CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh.

The best way to describe the sonic environment at the ’98 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry’s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.

It takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video’s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:

A second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as “babe” and asks her to readjust so as to “give us a little more bush down there.” An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular “Let me out of here, I can’t wait to get out of here.”6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell—a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant—and the Sands’ former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress’s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress—an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name—has normal-size breasts, and there’s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max’s videos’ promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!” Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or “Bizarro-Sleaze” filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8

Next to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lamé spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty—she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford—and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There’s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor’s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.

The booth for XPlor Media—a company known for its “Southern Belles” video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website—is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth’s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor’s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what’s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause célèbre at the ’98 CES because he’s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday’s Awards banquet.10

Everyone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry’s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like “A porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.” Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough—winner of AVN’s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both ’96 and ’97—alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he’s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis’s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).

And 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year’s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel’s popular “Butt Row” video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today’s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, “Present”) their own line of videos, e.g. “Tom Byron’s Cumback Pussy” series, “Jon Dough’s Dirty Stories,” the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi’s “[Various European Cities] By Night” line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.

It is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you’ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we’ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers’ faces in orgasm—that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR’s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:

“Most of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,” veteran starlet Shane has explained. “I’ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.” The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation—the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro.
It is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today’s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product’s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C §2257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:

Censorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, “legal” morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.

These trailers always say they’re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the ’80s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.

Feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography’s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment’s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some “masculists” believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:

At the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image… . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a “greater” deity, a more powerful force… . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday’s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid.

This kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands’ casino, or maybe until one’s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now “in the flesh,” complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see—never want to see—in films.

Maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being… . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers’ being sidelined with something called a “prolapsed sphincter,” which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who’s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he’s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth’s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her—you turn your head to look even if you don’t seem to want to. It’s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn’t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets—they’re never alone. They’re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.

FYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire’s cult-celebrity status at the ’98 CES stems from her having broken the “World Gang Bang Record”16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures’ 1996 World’s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who’d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal—“the People’s Porn Star”—and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of tête-à-tête above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who’s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth—after your correspondents have remarked on how it’s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers—dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soirée a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you’re interested, appears as FN17 just below. Twenty feet away, over at XPlor, Mr. Farrel Timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world’s only authorized Kenny® Action Figure from the upcoming South Park merchandising line—fourteen inches tall, kind of heavy for a doll, w/ hood up and face obscured (not unlike F. Timlake’s own hood and face)—and is entertaining some of the IM crowd’s spillover by manipulating the doll’s limbs to simulate its “tok[ing] a bone.”

Not unlike urban gangs, police, carnival workers, and certain other culturally marginalized guilds, the US porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school. There are cliques, anticliques, alliances, betrayals, conflagratory rumors, legendary enmities, and public bloodlettings, plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence. You’re either In or you’re not. Performers, being the industry’s fissile core, are of course In. Despite their financial power, studio execs and producers are not very In, and directors (especially those who’ve never undergone the initiation of having on-camera sex themselves) are less In than the performers. Film reviewers and industry journalists are even less In than execs; and nonindustry journalists are way, way non-In, almost as low-caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves (for which fans the Insider term is: mook18 ).

The foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore’s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite’s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls—which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, but yr. corresps. clung almost like papooses to their backs, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn’t quick enough about slamming the door.
So yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.

For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films’ worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse—a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake—to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there’s a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore’s hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. Nevertheless the tension persists, despite the fact that the actresses are obviously tired and disassociated from the day’s CES,19 plus, it emerges, somewhat sore—it turns out that Max Hardcore is shooting one of his “Gonzo” porn spectaculars right here at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, using the CES as a hook and backdrop, and the girls have been alternating CES booth-duty and riding-crop shenanigans with a tight and SS-intensive filming schedule. (Max, being a firm believer in the fait accompli method of filmmaking, has not yet gotten around to chatting with the CES’s administration about his featuring the world’s biggest consumer-tech tradeshow by name in a “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL” video.)

Mr. Max Hardcore—a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner, né Paul Little—is 5'6"" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence), Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year’s AVN Awards, which issues are the career, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.

Pioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (“Buttman”) Stagliano, “Gonzo” has become one of this decade’s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It’s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion—Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There’s always a randy and salivous “host” talking directly to a handheld camera: “Well and we’re here at the Cannes Film Festival, and it looks like there’s going to be lots of excitement, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there’s also the world-famous beach, and I’m told there’s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach, so let’s us head on down.” (That’s the approximate lead-in to a recent Max-at-Cannes Gonzo, a type of signature lead-in that Max refers to with a 56-tooth grin as “always mercifully brief”—and please note the “little girls at the beach” thing, because this is another of Max’s professional signatures, the infantilization of his videos’ females as dramatic foils for his own film persona, which is always that of a sort of degenerate uncle or stepdad.) Then the shaky but ever-focused camera heads on down to the ocean or mall or CES or whatever, scoping out attractive women20 while the host moans and chews his knuckle in lust. Then pretty soon host and camera start actually coming up to the women they’ve been looking at and engaging them in little cameo “interviews” full of sideways leers and salacious entendres. Some of the interviewees are actual civilians, but some are always what Max refers to as “ringers,” meaning professional porn actresses. And so the viewer is treated to the classic frathouse fantasy of moving, via just a couple of singles-bar “Hey there babe” lines, from scoping out an attractive woman to having wild and anatomically diverse sex with her, all while one of his buddies captures the whole thing on tape.21

The issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team—Max’s shoots are described (by Max) as “almost military operations”; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian “little girls” on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in “mainstream” (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, after detailing for yr. correspondents the vo- and avocations that led him into the adult industry (a tale too literally incredible even to think about factchecking and trying to print), informs us that he is and always has been adult video’s “cutting-edge blade,” and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max’s, degradations of women as a blueprint for their own subsequent shabby and derivative films’ degradations.23 (Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, by the way, have heard Max hold forth many times before and are now outside the circle of discourse—D.F. in the bathroom for what seems like a peculiarly long time, H.H. on the couch with the actresses hashing out the implications of Seinfeld’s retirement for NBC’s ’98 lineup.)

Alone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite’s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine’s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the ’68 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown—there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn’t.

Asked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: “I fucking stole it.” It’s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy’s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, upon exiting the stage (he’s always a presenter every year, which he regards as the AVNAs’ way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it, “What the fuck, I fucking deserve it” and snagged one, hiding it in his enormous Stetson and deriving no little satisfaction from attending various post-Awards parties with an illicit statuette under his hat. Max’s crew all laugh very hard at this anecdote, though the actresses don’t.

Alex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then—perhaps mistaking your correspondents’ expressions for ones of disbelief—she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.

So much about today’s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the “smoldering” sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for—the vanity, the vulgarity, the rank commercialism—and not only makes them overt and grotesque but seems then to revel in that grotesquerie.

Good old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath—that’s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona—but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You’d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, while his red-suited acolytes laugh on cue and a jr. high dropout shows off her valves. In truth, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him—we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you’re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they’ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she’s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara’s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along, which eventually results in the B-girls and crewmen and yr. corresps.26 all standing there awkwardly at the maître d’s podium while Max personally conducts the starlet to her table and pulls out her chair and tucks a serviette into her cleavage and pulls out a platinum-plated money clip and announces in a voice audible to everyone in the restaurant and foyer that he “want[s] to take care of the little girl’s damages in advance” and shoves bills into the hanky-pocket of the maître d’s tuxedo and then leaves her there by herself and herds us all back out and into the elevator and jabs impatiently at the button for his suite’s floor, almost jumping up and down with fury at the elevator’s delay; and we’re all rushed back up to the suite because it’s occurred to Max that he wants to show your corresps. something from this week’s filming that he thinks will sum up his particular porn genius better than any amount of exposition could … and then, reseated, he starts flipping through a notebook to find something.

“What it is is we got this one little girl back in the [infamous MAXWORLD] trailer, and after some face-fucking27 and reaming her asshole and, like, your standard depravities, we get her to stick a pen—no, a what-do-you-call …”

Crewman: “Magic Marker.”

Max: “… Magic Marker, stick it up her asshole and write all this … this stuff,” holding up the notebook, opened to a page; again he has us pass it around:

is thereon written in a hand28 that seems impressively legible, considering. Dick Filth makes a waggish inquiry about future film plans involving this girl and a typewriter, but Max doesn’t laugh (we noticed that Max never laughs at a joke he hasn’t told), and so neither does anyone else.

Doubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it’s worth also observing—when this magazine’s assigned photographer (who’s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.’s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes—the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip—so the photographer’ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background—with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, or both. It is important to note that there are no audible scare-quotes, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max’s face as he sketches this photo’s tableau for us; he’s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max’s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max’s proposing this very photo—i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage—but the Premiere photographer, who is no actor, does such a poor job of disguising his repulsion at Max’s self-regard that the atmosphere of the whole suite gets stilted and complexly hostile, and the rest of the interview is kind of a fizzle-yield, and overall Dick Filth said that we failed, in his phrase, to “penetrate to the core of the essence of what it is to be Max Hardcore.”30

The 15th Annual AVN Awards are actually split over two consecutive nights, a tactic that Max H. thought the legit Oscars would do well to emulate: “Get all the bullshit out of the way the first night—best packaging, marketing, best gay, shit like that. Who wants to sit through that shit?”

Held in a different, slightly smaller Caesars Palace ballroom, Friday’s Awards show is indeed brisk. The ephemeral categories include Best Videography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Music. Each category’s nominees are listed in the program, but only the winners are announced onstage, and they’re announced four at a time, and applause is discouraged, and the master of ceremonies keeps telling the quartets of winners that “If you’ll come on up quickly and help keep things moving it’ll help us out a lot.” Friday’s only food is big wheels of vegetables and dip near the cash bar. The emcee is not headliner Robert Schimmel but a hypomanic guy named Dave Tyree, whose interpolated banter is 78 rpm and consists of stuff like “If God didn’t want us to jerk off he would’ve made our arms shorter.” There are maybe 1,000 people in attendance, most only slightly dressed up, and there are no assigned tables, and everybody in the ballroom is moving around and chattering and treating the onstage proceedings the way people in a cocktail lounge treat the piano player.

Q. $4,000,000,000 and 8,000 new releases a year—why is adult video so popular in this country?
A. Director and AVN-Hall-of-Fame inductee F. J. Lincoln: “It’s always a little funny how it’s called adult. What it really is, you get to be a kid again. You roll around and get dirty. It’s the adult sandbox.”
A. Veteran woodman Joey Silvera: “Dudes, let’s face it—America wants to jerk off.”
A. Industry journalist Harold Hecuba: “It’s the new Barnum. Nobody ever goes broke overestimating the rage and misogyny of the average American male.”
A. Porn starlet Jacklyn Lick: “I think a lot of fans are very lonely people.”
Q. There don’t seem to be a whole lot of condoms used in hard-core scenes.
A. Harold Hecuba: “Never have been. They’re viewed as a turn-off. This business is about engineering fantasies.”
Q. But even just venerially—all these anal shenanigans and everything. Is there much worry in the industry about HIV?
A. Harold Hecuba: “There’s not as much worry about AIDS now. Everybody gets tested on a schedule.”
Q. What about herpes?
A. H.H.: “I think it’s rampant.”

Last year’s Best-Sex-Scene-in-a-Film winner Vince Vouyer’s real name turns out to be John LaForme. Rhetorical Q.: How, if one’s real name was John LaForme, could that person possibly feel the need for a nom de guerre?

Mr. Tom Byron describes being able to tumesce and ejaculate more or less on demand as an exercise in “control, like meditation or surfing. It’s like a gymnast staying on the balance beam. You practice enough, you can do anything.”31

Former woodman and current auteur Paul Thomas was a member of the original Broadway cast of Jesus Christ Superstar.

The tall, crazed-looking, and ever-rampant Mike Horner, three-time Best Actor winner and a member of the AVN Hall of Fame,32 is actually a classically trained opera singer.

Deceased starlet Nancy Kelly’s real name was Kelly Van Dyke. She was the daughter of TV’s Jerry Van Dyke and so, of course, the niece of Dick.

Exotic rookie actress Midori, one of the nominees in the ’98 AVNAs’ Best New Starlet category, is the sister of ’80s pop star Jodi Whatley. Midori has stated publicly that she views upscale contemporary porn as a stepping-stone to a mainstream career, not unlike becoming Miss America or doing a couple seasons on SNL. Harold Hecuba characterizes Midori’s career strategy as “grievously ill-advised.”

Adult Video News VP and Executive Editor Gene Ross, presenting the aforementioned 1998 AVN Award for Best Director/Video to Miscreants’ Rob Black, will hail Mr. Black as “a guy who can take buttholes, midgets, and fried fish, and make a love story.”33

From The New Yorker’s 1995 article on the psychosexual plight of the adult industry’s woodman: “The Cal Jammers who are part of this feminization feel they have stormed the walls of female ornament to reclaim male prerogative, only to find themselves lost in a garden of gender irony.”

Mr. John “Buttman” Stagliano—CEO of Evil Angel Inc., a man described by US News & World Report as “the nation’s leading director of hard-core videos”—not only has publicly announced testing positive for HIV but has identified the infection’s vector as a transsexual prostitute in São Paulo with whom Stagliano had unprotected anal intercourse in 1995. He’s anxious that people not get the wrong idea: “I am not particularly interested in guys, but I am interested in dicks. Forbidden taboos lead to all sorts of neurotic behavior, which leads to me being fucked in the ass without a rubber.”

Are the AVN Awards possibly rigged? Max Hardcore (he of the purloined statuette, keep in mind) calls the Awards “a total conflict of interests.” After all, he explains, Adult Video News is heavily ad-dependent,34 and they’re under “pressure from the big hitters like Vivid and VCA to like, you know, give the nod.”

Ms. Ellen Thompson, AVN Associate Editor and an Awards judge who votes under the n.d.g. Ida Slapter:35 “We’ve heard this for years. I hear this complaining also goes on in the mainstream. I don’t like insulting anybody, but sometimes there’s sour grapes. What are we supposed to say? Vivid and VCA put out good product. We truly, honestly do vote fairly.”

Mr. Dick Filth: “The best perception, backed up by tons of anecdotal evidence, is that they are totally, totally fixed and rigged.”
Saturday’s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES, and they are seriously dolled up. There are cerise halters and pear-colored Lycra bodysuits with open-toed pumps of burgundy suede. There are platinum lamé gowns slit all the way to the tenth rib. Bottoms less covered than shellacked look like they by all rights should have panty- or at least thong lines but do not have such lines. There are lime-green vinyl leotards and toile bellbottoms and fishscale bustiers and miniskirts the same texture and length as a tutu’s ruffle. Garter straps flash and Merry Widow bodices shade the interiors of translucent blouses. Several of the outfits defy very basic precepts of modern physics. Coiffures are towering and complex. The starlets are all on the arms of men, but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4""+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase “Va Va Voom,” which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl—arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that’s mostly fringe—has inflated her breasts to what’s got to be maximum capacity.

Woodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there’s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk à la British punks of the late 1970s.

Inside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace’s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we’d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it’s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone’s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes, several of the male Insiders—including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi—are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry’s elite woodmen are short—5'6"", 5'7""36 —and most of their companions tower over them. Dick Filth confirms that the contemporary industry’s 5'6"" standard helps a prodigious male organ look even more prodigious on videotape, a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.

Tickets for Saturday’s main event are $195 per, in advance. It’s unclear whether any Insiders’ tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it’s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket, tonight’s attendance can confidently be fixed at 2,500.
The Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the—as it were—joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards’ audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is “The History of Adult”) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.

Both Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.’s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom’s L’s northern leg, hundreds of yards from even the nearest video screen. “They always put the print guys out in mookland,” Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice, have brought in their own picnic hampers.

Now moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts’ fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously, the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4"" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house, accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, who is here to receive a Special AVN Achievement Award for His Lifelong Defense of the First Amendment. Black is so resoundingly In this year that even the starched linen napkins at everyone’s place settings are black. The wineglasses all have little frosted cameos of J. Caesar on them. Humorless men with walkie-talkies stand guard at each of the ballroom’s fire doors—apparently last year there were some problems with unauthorized Caesars Palace employees sneaking in to watch the gala. The video screens are now showing the climactic scene of Debbie Does Dallas, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes “NEXT?” The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41

The closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba’s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic), who himself is not up for many ’98 Awards because he spent a good part of the past year in court and/or detention for helping operate an escort service which authorities alleged was not a bona fide escort service at all.

It turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can’t run any sort of tab—you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, with additional complications if certain people are buying drinks for certain tablemates but not for certain other tablemates, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom’s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure, who are taking some serious abuse about the pay-as-you-go beverage policy from mooks with cigars at the nearby tables, despite the fact that the waiters don’t make the rules and must surely find having to remember and make change for six to eight different customers per table a piercing pain in the ass44 ) have only rudimentary ESL skills and tend to confuse both drink orders and currency denominations. Dick Filth leans over and shouts: “Now you can maybe see why this is a multibillion-a-year industry—they’re tight as a duck’s butt!”45

The crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners’ serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:

“Fellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!” intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he’s long deserved. “I want to thank my mother, who spread her legs and made all this possible.” Large sections of the crowd are on their feet—Goldstein is a porn icon. He was distributing NYC’s Screw on photostat when most of the people in this room were still playing with their toes. He’s been a First Amendment ninja. He drinks in the applause and loves it and is hard not to sort of almost actually like. He’s clearly an avatar of contemporary porn’s unabashedness, its modern Yeah-OK-I’m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:

“I salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They’re the real heroes.” Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.

This has followed Robert Schimmel’s intro and a 20-minute “Musical Salute to the History of Adult,” in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified, and they all have flared collars and tight perms—it’s like watching The Brady Bunch’s final season through borrowed binoculars. The stage is lit by autotrack spotlights whose colors alternate w/o discernible scheme.

The whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don’t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures’ Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, gets repeatedly pronounced “Satter.” Winners are supposed to exit stage-left after their acceptance speeches, but even people who’ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters—not many, but some—who are obviously coked to the gills.

Probably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them “an opening” or “a shot” or “my big shot” and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists’ table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who’s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show’s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN’s Gene Ross pays tribute to ’98’s Male Performer of the Year by saying: “You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Tom Byron’s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.” Rob Black’s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there’s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48

To be fair, some of the nominated products’ titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene—along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin’—but loses out to a scene the Program entitles “Anal Food Express”49 from a video called My Girlfriend’s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas’s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel’s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, and Best Anal Sex Scene/Film50 for Lauren and Steven St. Croix. Best Compilation Tape honors go to The Voyeur’s Favorite Blow Jobs & Anals. David Cronenberg’s mainstream Crash comes out of absolutely nowhere to win something called Best Alternative Adult Feature Film. Ms. Stephanie Swift wins Best Actress/Video and tells the crowd: “Thanks, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.”51

Max Hardcore, to Table 189’s immense and unkind delight, doesn’t win one single thing.

An actor named Jim Buck wins AVN’s Gay Performer of the Year Award, and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10"" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears, even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It’s Jim Buck’s little brother. “Jim can’t be here tonight because he’s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans,” the little boy says (correspondential expressions of bug-eyed inquiry at Hecuba and Filth—Shakespeare festival? sending a prepubescent relative to collect your excellence-in-filmed-sodomy prize?—are met with bemused shrugs), “but I’m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.” [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]

A strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men’s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum’s men’s room’s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:

“Found this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can’t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.”

“You going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?”

“Nah. That’s the whole point. I’m the director. This is my package now.”

“Oh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big” [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].

“Well, we’ll see.” [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.]

The Awards Show’s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars’ feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end—though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 —but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr’actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition “Psycho Magnet,” a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song’s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, but Ms. Lauren struts and contorts and punctuates her phrasing with uppercuts to the air like a genuine MTV diva. The downside is that vocally, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette, and H. Hecuba chimes in by shouting: “Say whatever you want about the song-and-dance numbers here, they sure beat what Wahlberg and Reilly were coming up with in Boogie Nights!”

Hecuba’s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as “Doctor Dirty—the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,” proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. “Just got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin’./Goo goo goo drippin’ out my back door” is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, though titles like “Sit on a Happy Face” and “It’s a Small Dick After All” have proved maddeningly hard to forget. Nobody at or around our table has ever heard of Doctor Dirty before, but almost everyone agrees that he’s the ’98 gala’s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz’s 1997 seminude rendition of “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There’s also the ’98 ceremony’s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as “the Spicy Girls” and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.

Something else happens every year. It’s never part of AVN’s videotape of the gala, but it’s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom’s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum’s waiters. A lot of this year’s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, who pulls down the starboard side of her strapless taffeta and allows the waiter to cup her right breast while Table 189’s own personal waiter55 snaps the photo. Another waiter goes around behind Ms. Ann Amoré—a very personable black lady with a 50-inch bust and gang tattoos all down both arms—and hunches over behind her as she bends forward and releases her breasts from confinement, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he’s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend’s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they’re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank, distant way that they were with the mooks at the Adult CES.

Trying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo’d glasses they’ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel’s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, and the crowd parts slightly to allow a narrow passage for the Awards’ attendees, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It’s late, and everyone’s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand’s spectators earlier. Now it’s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars, and there’s a weird mix of adulation and derision:

“Love you, Brittany!”

“How’d you get that dress on, baby?”

“Look over here!”

“Does your mother know where you’re at right now?”

One florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don’t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.

Mr. Dick Filth is behind us with one hand on each of yr. corresps.’ shoulders (we’re basically supporting him out). Everyone’s ears are still ringing, and Filth knows enough to almost shout:

“You know,” he says, “we’ve also got the XRCO Awards in February. X-Rated Critics Organization Awards—you get me? They’re not in Vegas, and they’re not rigged. And yet they manage to be just as ridiculous.”",David Foster Wallace,1988,"[86, 66, 65, 69, 75, 79, 93]",7
169,Hold On To The Nights,"[Verse 1]
Just when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever-changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind
Could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for awhile
Won't you let me shelter you

[Chorus]
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you
Something more
That I could be yours

[Verse 2]
How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise
Promises in vain
Love that is real
But in disguise

What happens now
Do we break another rule?
Let our lovers play the fool?
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

[Chorus]
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

[Bridge]
Well, I think that I've been true
To everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you
Makes my heart long to be free

Every time I look into your eyes
I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for
Is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories

171,Roll With It,"[Verse 1]

Hang in and do that sweet thing you do

Now there'll be a day you'll get there, baby
You'll hear the music play, you'll dance, baby
You'll leave bad times way behind
Nothing but good times on your mind
You can do it, roll with it, baby

And summergirls are everywhere
They raise excitability
I like the things they do to me

Sing this song

Summergirls set the pace
With sunglasses on their face
Excuse me if I stop and stare
I like the kind of clothes they wear

Summergirls
All day long
I like summergirls
Sing this song
I wish they all could be like summergirls

Summergirls at the beach
Sexy suits and hard bodies
Their golden brown bodies sweat
I like to see them soaking wet

Summergirls in the sun
All day long
Summergirls
Just having fun
Sing this song
I wish they all could be like summergirls

I like the summergirls
They're turning me on
They look so good to me
These summergirls are sweet
I wanna take one home with me

Take your sorry

Oh send me off to war
In a far away land

Subject me to the truth
To the horror and pain
Until my mind is twisted

And what if I fail
Will you put me in jail
For a murder I will not commit?
'Cos you don't understand
Till there's blood on your hands
That it's time to forget and forgive

(Chorus)
And those who return
Come back only to learn
That they're hated by those who they love
'Cos you're not satisfied
Till a thousand have died
And your anger is paid for in blood

Bitch how many bodies you got, hmm?
Shut yo dumb ass up

[Verse]
I ain’t scared of no bitch, I ain’t scared of Cuban either
Raps got y’all fooled, I know she ain’t no shooter either
Bitch thought it was sweet, till I caught her outta hell shit
Bitches was bout to run, and I still ain’t get my nails fixed
Fuck it
I’ll be broke, but y’all bitches don’t sell shit
Knew you hoes was weak
Jump in some beef so how you scared bitch
It’s the real B
And I ain’t come to play around this bitch
You in Detroit, I’m on yo ass
Y’all can’t stay around this bitch
I got a shooter with a drum
And I keep his ass on stand by
Bitches playing dirty then they mans die
These hoes be talking, I can beat em with my hands tied
Bitch ain’t have no hands, even her mans ain’t even swing by
Bitch ain’t got no friends, even yo mans know you can’t swing Ma
Fucked a couple rappers, now she think she the man huh
Was sending threats to Asian, how you geeked cause she yo friend now
Got fucked by Kodak Black, but you ain’t got a Benz now
Make that bitch get on her knees, Tadoe blacked her eyes
You was dick sucking Molly, now she ain’t on yo side
Came out the stu and felt these hands, bitch I’m hurting yo pride
Lil bitch was playing tough, till I caught her outside
So all that draco, cut it
You keep telling me lies
Every bitch I’m with would’ve dogged every one of yo guys
Had my hung with both hands, you couldn’t swing if you tried
How you fronting like you won, bitch we all know you lying
Why these hoes don’t model, cause they funny rappping
I got boo’d in my city, cause they funny acting
Everybody outside know what really happened
These bitches soft to sum it up, this what really happened
Joseph begging Natashia to pull me off of you
The bitch you came with ain’t even bust a move
So if we jumped
Shoot, yo mans was right in front of you
You should be dissing her not me, but that’s what dummies do
Was looking for that chain, cause that bitch was coming off of you
Next time you know to shield, or this shit is off of you
If you busy winning, how the fuck you know what I can do
You are not a street bitch, you are just a prostitute
You ain’t hurt nobody, shit I knocked the lashes off of you
Bitches want some smoke
Shit, I knocked the ashes off of you
I’m a find out who yo writer is and smack that nigga
Same reason why a bitch always rapping niggas
Joseph’s pussy ass was shooked
My bitches should’ve grab that nigga
I ain’t surprised, same reason why I laugh at niggas
They just hate I’m in my bag though
My young niggas say I’m acting like a asshole
Couple niggas switch, tell I ain’t mad though
Praying on my downfall, but still ain’t got a bag though
And these bitches ain’t got shit coming
Only time a bitch is nice is when the bitch cumming
And they be stalking my life, but swear a bitch nothing
And they be talking bout ice, as if that means something
Lil bitch get yo shit snatched
And we ain’t lacking over here, get yo shit smacked

You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you other kids all across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand

[Verse 1]
I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, “What's wrong? This shirt cost $20”
I said, “Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!”
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, “Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep”
She said, “You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet”
I said, “Mom, let's put these clothes back, please”
She said “No, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show”
I said, “This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks”
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, “No, no way, uh-uh, forget it”
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, “If they were laughing you don't need them
'Cause they're not good friends”
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

[Verse 2]
Oh-kay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't...
Yeah, of course, I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, “Was that for me?”
I said, “Yeah”
She said, “Why?”
I said, “Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy”
She said, “How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic”
I said, “C'mon, toots, my name is the Prince
Besides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?”
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, “Drive fast, speed turns me on”
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sunroof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, “I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer”
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, “Ah, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?”
They didn't speak - I said, “I want to plead my case”
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake

I got all this love, waiting just for you
I just gotta know, that your love is true
Can't keep running boy, in and out my life
Wanna be your girl, not cause the mood is right

[Pre-Chorus]
If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me, when I need someone to hold me
Baby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man
I just need a little time, before I invest my love

Don't walk away boy, (ooh don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (no no)
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you

You push all my buttons baby
Love to have you close to me
Wanna feel your love, wanna be for sure
That it's me you need baby, each and every night

I want you for my man

190,Button Off My Shirt,"I've heard the word going 'round town
They say that you're making a fool out of me
Baby, it took me some time to come 'round
To realize you were not what you seem

Each day's passing, the clock's been my friend
Helped me get back on my feet again
Like a button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be overreacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt and someday I will replace you

I don't care what I have lost
You got what you deserve
I was down, down, down, I was down
I`m not the first and I won`t be the last
To make the mistake of believing in you
I don't intend to live in the past
Just like they say: some you win, some you lose
You never loved me and you made it plain
Now it's my turn and I'm playing your game
Like a button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be overreacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt and some day I will replace you

I don't care what I have lost
You got what you deserve
Love and affection
You started changing directions
You threw it away
Girl, you threw it away
You never loved me and you made it plain
Now it's my turn to make you understand
Like a button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be overreacting, if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt, and someday I will replace you

I don`t care what I have lost
You got what you deserved
Like the button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be overreacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt and someday I will replace you

I don`t care what I have lost
You got what you deserved
Like a button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be overreacting, if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt and someday I will replace you",Paul Carrack,1988,"[91, 97, 98]",3

192,The Right Stuff,"[Verse 1]
I was standing at 7:15
Waiting for my baby's car
Just then out stepped
The driver of a limousine
And asked if I was going far

I said I've got my mind made up
I don't wanna leave him, baby
'Cause it's clear to me
That it's just to tough to
Find another lover like mine

[Chorus]
With the right stuff
The right stuff, baby
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
Ooh, no
With Mr. Right

[Verse 2]
Just Friday 'bout a week ago
This fellow called me on the phone
And said, ""I live in Paris
Don't you want to go
I know you must be all alone""

Well, it'll take more than a fancy trip
Or a chauffeured limousine
'Cause I ain't never seen no one
Who could give me love like this
The other fellows don't compare

[Chorus]
To the right stuff
The right stuff, baby
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
Ooh, no
With Mr. Right
Sing

[Bridge]
He's the only to give me that loving
'Cause next to him
There is no other one
He's very sexy and oh so sweet
And he knocks me off my feet

193,I Still Believe,"[Verse 1]
You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

[Chorus]
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

[Verse 2]
Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no, oh oh I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together woah oh no, no, no, ooh
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again ummm
Oh woah, oh hoh, oh hoh

[Chorus]
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again (ooh baby, yeah yeah)
I had a dream, you and me
Will find ourselves in love again, yeah
I still believe (Ooh baby, I do)
Someday you and me (Just give me one more try)
In love again, yeah

Our world's out of order
All I see is Missed Opportunity

Will we ever learn
In trouble where will we turn
And when you're losing the fight
Who's your white knight gonna be
Feel you drift away

We had a chance to stay together
Ooh forever
But we got lost in the dream

Keep on missing each other
Our world's out of order
All I see is Missed Opportunity

Talk but never show
You're holding back
Words lack meaning that's all
Things you say ricochet

She be
Hoping that she might appear, out of nowhere

All the hurt inside, the wounded pride
Ooh what she went through for you
You cheated and lied, as her love slowly died
And her heart just broke in two

When she was with you, all along
Behind you right or wrong
She tried to hold on, hold on
But you went too far, and she's gone

And now it's over and her heart turns to stone
No time for pity, when her heart turns to stone
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone
She's that kind of woman
She'll do fine on her own

What you thought was a game
A game you were winning
Wouldn't go your way
Now you've lost what you had
And your back to the beginning
It's the price you have to pay

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She hides the pain
But her heart turns to stone
No time for pity
When her heart turns to stone
She cries sometimes
As her heart turns to stone

She'll get by on her own

Yeah it's over
And her heart turns to stone

So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong
Cos when you get back home maybe I'll be gone

When the nights go down
When you've had your fill
When there's nothing left

It would cause me pain

Isn't black or white

Of what's wrong or right

Do you know what she means to me
Know how I care?
If you looked in her heart you'd see no colour there
Well I don't care, Care what you like if you see there's a
Colour of love
Beneath her black skin, she runs red with blood
And I'd give her my soul, if only I could
'Cause loves an emotion that trancends all colour and creed
I'm leaving you now
'cause you're blinded by what you can't see
First you ask for respect, then you bathe in fear
I say nothing is due, nd my concience is clear
And that's sincere
Would you call my name would you say you'd be there?
Would you turn around just when I needed you (needed you)
In your suburbs you burn you're content with your fate
Stuck behind your green hedges and white washed black hate

I don't wanna move so fast, I don't wanna blow it

Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, ""Back in my day""
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?

So when he buried in a tomb full of gold

So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada

With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard

206,Love Changes (Everything),"I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way
Seems like yesterday
I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away
I've never been the same

I felt the strangest feeling
Like a raging fire it burned
She left, I cried for weeks
And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away
Had to earn my pay
Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say
It only ended up the same way

And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone?
Oh, girl, you answered my question
This time it's working, you've given me new hope

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you
It's got a power of its own

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

(Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho
(Love changes) Let's make love

Okay, woo!
Yeah (Okay)

I give a fuck less and less everyday (Okay)
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)
Homie we just out here tryna elevate
Heaven is a crime scene, stay behind the yellow tape (Whoop whoop)
I started making money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008
Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just rambling
You want war? It’s N64, Blitz Champion (Sucker)
Out of space channeling, brain damaging
Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American
They tell me ""Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?""

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm a deranged motherfucker, took too many uppers
Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker (50 million dollars!)
I stuck around for the past six summers
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya
We was in the attic you could smell the weed
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs
They tell me ""Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?""

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch

Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart

When two punks chose to risk the subway
For a tube to Picadilly

Kiss me, deadly, tonight

Another battle was won and lost
Down The Bishops End last night
Spotlights pick the kids in triumph
With a thousand scarves in flight, see how they run
Spring from the terraces in black and white
Young and old into the fight

In South West Six
With violence for a fix
Kiss me, deadly, tonight

Seven o'clock they stand in rank
For the thirty bus uptown
And later in a downstairs room
She pulls her lover down
In ecstacy but they can't make a sound
Case her mother might come down

Cause they're all out playing pool

I pulled the trigger
I heard a noise - the room went dark

[Verse 1]
Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say ""Live fast, die young,"" so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard ""Can't Get Enough""
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, ""The Things Hoes Say""
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
I'm in trouble

And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like ""Don't you know this shit already?""
""Nigga, ain't you rich already?""
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho

Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

Fuck yo' night list, fuck yo' day list, fuck yo' playlist

Like guardian angels it's always near

Keep the nightlight on inside
The birdhouse in your soul

Make a little birdhouse in your soul
While you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside
The birdhouse in your soul

But if you don't
Just let me go

'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me ""No""
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

(Chorus)

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy

He took her all the way down the long valley road
They sent her away not too much later

Sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow
This time I'll go where she wants me to go
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
Go deep in the woods down the long valley road

Walk on walk on little doll walk
Walk on little doll

Out in the hall they were talkin' in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone a while
Somebody said she was gone to her sister's
Everyone knew what they were talkin' about

While no one was looking on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
Came back around like nothin' really happened
Left him standing on the old valley road

Walk on walk on little doll walk on
Walk on little doll
Walk on, walk on the valley road

That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need.""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: ""There's no turning back.""

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town

Who promise fortune and fame

Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything

But I hate sleeping alone

I said: ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright.""
Diana walked up to me
She said: ""I'm all yours tonight.""
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright.""

Because he's sleeping with me.""

Ayo, it's two up in the morning with the lights off (lights off)
Insomnia got me up, time to write more (write more)
Tryna make some more beats, when my fingers hit the keys
I'm pleased, feel like everything alright, y'all

In my life, y'all really don't know what I'm feelin' day to day
So if you look me in my eye and see all of the hate and pain
Know I could be bangin' out some colors like it's Bathin' Ape
But music took to raisin' me, blame it for tryna save me, hey

I coulda sold drugs, coulda been a stickup kid
Coulda been an old thug, loadin' clips and shit
Coulda caught a chrome slug, from a pistol, it's
All thanks to music I don't do it, it's ridiculous

Don't think cash when I write my songs
I wanna last way longer than the time I'm gone
So next time you see the flash of my iPod on
Know I need it just to last, and do right from wrong, hold on

Softly, as if I play piano in the dark
Softly, as if I play piano in the dark
Softly, as if I play piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger, now to embark

Listen close to the message I move along to ya
There's a reason I'm aggressive in my songs, do ya
Know what it's like to fight the past, can't move on to a
Bright future? Music'll move me, keep my head on cooler

Softly, as I play piano in the dark
Know that every piece of rappin' comin' from my heart
No, I do not choose to speak happiness, singing larks
Cuz I ain't been a part of that sappyness, it's been hard

Bars are theraputic to me, it's an art
Disregard all the stupid talk, it plays a vital part
In the process of healing, let it rock till I feel it
This my Glock, and I'm killing all my got damn demons

To embark, on a sound mission
'Till I live around bliss and
'Till I'm in the ground
Hope everything all around glisten

Embark, on a sound mission
'Till I live around bliss and
'Till I'm in the ground
Hope everything all around glisten

And headed for the samba

Than to watch the sunrise in your eyes

Gonna give you everything your heart desires
Yes I got the feeling, making me feel so good
Gonna give you everything your heart desires

Come with me now, let's take a flight to Mexico
Something there I want to show you
Lets take our wings like butterflies, together we can touch the skies

Hunger locked in time
We can start a fire
But we can't control the flame
And I just can't wait to feel the heat again
In the middle of the night

She cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeah
I said too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Well it just seems like yesterday
I was running alone
I turn my back home love
But baby I wasn't wrong
Do I miss your touch
Or tell myself a lie
Then I can't get enough
When I'm lying by your side
In the middle of the night

She cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeah
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I gotta burning heart baby

Do I miss your touch
Or tell myself a lie
And I can't get enough
When I'm lying by your side

She cry too much ain't enough love to satisfy me, yeah
I said too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I gotta burn it hard baby

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
But I smoke as fire baby
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me hey...

I said too too much ain't enough love
Yeah ... to satisfy me, Oh

268,We All Sleep Alone,"Somebody, somewhere, turns off the lights
Somebody all alone faces the night
You've got to be strong
When you're out on your own
'Cause sooner or later
We all sleep alone

Nobody, nowhere, holds the key to your heart
When love's a possession, it'll tear you apart
You may have lovers wherever you roam
But sooner or later
Ooh, we all sleep alone

Oh, the young and the young at heart wait
But the wait never ends in the soul
When you feel love is all gone away
Independence has come
And into the night I go

Don't make no promises that I can't keep
I won't be no prisoner of somebody's needs
You may have lovers wherever you roam
But sooner or later
Ooh, we all sleep alone
Ooh, we all sleep alone

Yeah, yeah, we all sleep alone, yeah
And I know, and I know how you feel
Like I've taken what you're saying to me
'Cause we all sleep alone
Yes, we all sleep alone",Cher,1988,"[100, 79, 48, 22, 15, 14, 16, 20, 23, 27, 32, 40, 51, 64, 84]",15
269,You Have Placed A Chill In My Heart,"You have placed a chill in my heart
You have placed a chill in my heart
Take me to the desert
Where there's got to be
A whole heap of nothing
For you and me
Take me to the desert
Take me to the sand
Show me the colour of your right hand
You have placed a chill in my heart
You have placed a chill in my heart
Love is a temple
Love is a shrine
Buy some love at the five and dime
A little bit of love
From the counter store
Get it on credit if you need some more
I'll be the figure of your disgrace
A criss cross pattern upon your face
A woman's just too tired to think
About the dirty old dishes in the kitchen sink
I wish I was invisible
So I could climb through the telephone
When it hurts my ear
And it hurts my brain
And it makes me feel too much
Too much too much too much
Don't cut me down
When I'm talking to you
'Cause I'm much too tall
To feel that small
Love is a temple
Love is a shrine
Love is pure
And love is blind
Love is a religious sign
I'm gonna leave this love behind
Love is hot and love is cold
I've been bought and I've been sold
Love is rock and love is roll
I just want someone to hold",Annie Lennox,1988,"[86, 67, 64, 65, 73, 78, 95]",7
270,Rhythm Of Love,"[Spoken Intro]
You know, this old world
It just keeps on spinning around and around and around
And sometimes it just spins too fast
And you, you not only lose your balance
But you lose your rhythm
And it's at times like these that you just need to stop
And not only find your way again but find your own rhythm
Because life has a rhythm
And Mother Nature has a rhythm
And love...oh yes, love has a rhythm

[Verse 1]
Can't you come away, away tonight and talk to me?
Far away from all the world's insanity
Fill your heart with music tonight
Satisfy your soul and ease your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Open your arms, close your eyes
Hearts will harmonize
Making music in your arms
Never before, never anymore
Will you be alone
Now that you have known...

[Chorus]
My rhythm of love, baby
Rhythm of love
Rhythm of love, darling
The rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
Hold me closer now
Times are troubled, there's no doubt
Where's the cure in times like these?
The rhythm of love is the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Open your arms, close your eyes
Hearts will harmonize
Making music in your arms
I'll never leave anyone, a fool could see
We have all we need, as long as we believe

[Chorus]
The rhythm of love, baby
The rhythm of love
Rhythm of love, darling
The rhythm of love

[Bridge]
Oh Lord, where would I go?
Oh, without you here to love me, baby?
Oh Lord, what would I do?
Oh, without you here to love me, ahh yeah
I can't stop it
I don't want to stop it
Darling, oh no, no, no

Oh, you must live by the rhythm
Oh, you, you must love by the rhythm
Oh, you must live by the rhythm
Oh, you must love by the rhythm, yeah yeah yeah",Anita Baker,1988,"[94, 86, 75, 81, 87, 89, 96, 74, 56, 43, 40, 44, 47, 53, 62, 64]",16
271,I Don't Want To Live Without You,"[Verse 1]
I find myself in a strange situation
And I don't know how
What seemed to be an infatuation
Is so different now
I can't get by if we're not together
Ooh can't you see
Girl, I want you now and forever
Close to me

[Bridge]
I'm longing for the time
I'm longing for the day
Hoping that you will promise to be mine
And never go away

[Chorus]
I don't want to live without you[x2]
I could never live without you
Live without your love

[Verse 2]
I ask myself but there's no explanation
For the way I feel
I know I've reached the right destination
And I know it's real

[Bridge]
I'm longing for the time
I'm longing for the day
When I'll be giving you this heart of mine
Believe me when I say

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
Now I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never be without you
Be without your love
I don't want to live without you
Live without your love[x2]
You see I'm lost without your love

272,When We Kiss,"It was late one night
And we had a fight
And it seemed like nothing
Was going right
Then you turned around
And you walked
Right out the door
Now it`s not the first time
It`s not the last
I know all about
Your checkered past
And we played this game
One thousand times before
Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said
There`s a real fine line
Between love and hate
And I`m not the type
To just sit and wait
I`ve made up my mind
I can`t wait for you anymore
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much
So many days go by
And I still want you so
If it was up to me
I`d never let you go
You`re the only true love in my life
And I want you to know
All this passion and pain
I think I`m going insane
We`ve got nothing to lose
And so much to gain
If you love me today
Who`s to say you`d not leave me again
Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said
There`s a real fine line
Between love and hate
And I`m not the type
To just sit and wait
I`ve made up my mind
I can`t wait for you anymore
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much
---- Instrumental Interlude ----
It was late one night
And we had a fight
And it seemed like nothing
Was going right
Then you turned around
And you walked right out the door
Now it`s not the first time
It`s not the last
I know all about
Your checkered past
And we played this game
One thousand times before
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much......",Bardeux,1988,"[98, 81, 71, 54, 38, 36, 39, 41, 47, 48, 56, 58, 67]",13
273,Most Of All,"[Verse 1]
I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea

[Verse 2]
But I don't worry much about time lost
I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find
'Cause he taught me how to walk the best that I can
On the road I've left behind

[Chorus]
But most of all
He taught me to forgive
How to keep a cool head
How to love the one you're with
And when I'm far into the distance
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

[Verse 3]
I haven't heard my mother's voice in a while
But her words are always falling out my mouth
My mind and spirit are at odds sometimes
And they fight like the north and the south

[Verse 4]
But I still care enough to bear the weight
Of the heaviness to which my heart is tethered
She taught me how to be strong and say goodbye
And that love is forever

[Chorus]
But most of all
She taught me how to fight
How to move across the line
Between the wrong and the right
And when I'm turned out in the darkness
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love

Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you
Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you

[Outro]
I haven't seen my father in some time

Underneath a sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me

Your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head
Say you wanna be a midnight rambler

Quickly, but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, get up
On the beat now, uh

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, c'mon
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, uh

Gotta get up, start livin' again
When you're drownin' in your loneliness
The hurtin' never ends....
And the night rolls on
I search for some piece of mind
No, I can't be wrong
Won't get burned by desire this time

Gonna wait on love, holdin' on till I find the one
Wait on love, won't hold back
I promised myself, till it comes...
Gonna wait on love

Wanna get close with somebody
When a voice says I'm movin' too fast
It's hard to know when to walk away
Or try to make it last......
Still the night rolls on
Secrets are safe in the dark
And I stayed too long
I'm not gonna lie to my heart

Gonna wait on love, holdin' on till I find the one
Wait on love, won't hold back
I promised myself, till it comes...
Gonna wait on love

279,When You Walk In The Room,"I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playing lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room

I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I see a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room

Maybe it's a dream come true
Walking right alongside of you
Wish I could tell you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just any time that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound and I hear thunder boom

Every time that you walk in the room",The Young Veins,1988,"[95, 90, 92]",3

Take it while it's hot
Take it while it's hot
Give it all you got
Take it while it's hot

Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1:]
I've always dreamed this was the way that it could be
Just like a fantasy
You're here along with me
So now it seems we've slipped into reality
And it's plain to see this is our destiny

Feelings I try to hold just seem to take control
I lie awake
My body shakes with just one thought of you
The door is open wide
So won't you come inside
And do those special things that lovers do

[Chorus:]
Take it while it's hot
I think the time is right
Take it while it's hot
I want your love tonight
Give it all you got
Don't let this feeling end
Take it while it's hot
Cause it may not come again

Sometimes I'm shy
But now I think that you should know
The deeper that we go
The more my feelings show
Time passes by just like birthdays come and go
So light the candles, babe
And I'll make a wish and blow

I love the way you groove
I'm gonna make this move
It's time to live
I wanna give you what your waiting for
The lights are pink and low
I think we're good to go
We're wasting time and I can't wait no more

281,Strange But True,"[Verse 1]
Okay, let me say this quick - before I start to cry
You are the only one that I gave it to, the one I fantasize for
And time away from you has taught me
What I should have known
That this hole I'm trying to fill with another yeah, it's grown
And I got your package
But when I tried to write back I bailed
See, trying to express the future, sometimes language fails
And over this time I've learned
My life force is increased by knowing you
Every door that closes, another one opens

[Chorus]
Strange but true
Strange but true

[Verse 2]
No regrets because I forget the unfamiliar faces
Those petty lies and alibis, just gold digers chasing
Dreams of sovereignty, they tried to come between you and me
A curse therein set forces a chain of events
That only freed me when I remembered
Where I was and who I am
The only Prince that will ever rule this holy land
All understand and all standunder this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God

[Bridge]
All negativity bows

[Chorus]
Strange but true
Strange but true

[Verse 3]
You may have lost me, but I found myself
The ones who love me without condition this is my wealth
And with these words I will win
Repeat them over and over again
All understand and all standunder this affirmation now

And started a fire
Had the radio playin'
From inside the car

Who are at the end of their rope

We were gettin' ready
To shake out of that place

Got in my face
He said, You're on private property
But once he cooled down he was ok
Sometimes you're golden, man

Pamela est là que quand la came est là
Si tu ne comprends pas c'est vraiment que pour toi, il n'y a pas plus d'espoir
Ça ne m'enchante pas, de prendre tous tes biens mais je n'ai pas 17 choix
Y a qu'la vérité qui blesse, j't'aime pas mais je te laisse en vie pour que t'encaisse
Mais Pamela, roule sur le périph' j'suis en état d'ivresse
J'suis cramé là, constamment sur le corner moi je visser
T'as hérité de mes textes de mes beats et de mes prouesses
J'fume j'te rejoins dans les airs, je serai passager tu seras mon hôtesse

Pamela m'a rencardé, j'pense à y aller mais j'suis pas sûr
Faut qu'j'ihnale en Côte d'Azur, là présence d'argent me rassure
Le rhinocéros est féroce, le temps passe de plus en plus vite
Jeune leur-dea sous le rosier, la ville de Paris se fait de plus en plus vide
Wesh Pamela ! Wesh Pamela ! J'ai la flicaille sur mes côtes
C'est le trésor que j'découvre, et c'est du concret que j'propose

289,Like The Weather,"[Verse 1]
The color of the sky as far as I can see is coal gray
Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lips as if i might cry
Well by the force of will my lungs are filled and so i breathe
Lately it seems this big bed is where i never leave
Shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
Quiver in my voice as i cry

[Chorus:]
What a cold and rainy day
Where on earth is the sun hid away?

[Verse 2:]
I hear the sound of a noon bell chime, i'm far behind
You've put in 'bout half a day while here i lie
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lip as if i might cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Do i need someone
Here to scold me or do i need someone
Who'll grab and pull me
Out of this four poster dull torpor
Pulling downward
It is such a long time since my better days
I say my prayers nightly this will pass away
The color of the sky is gray as i can see through the blinds
Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my voice as i cry

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, ""I do"")

Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me any pair, I will (C'mon)

302,Endless Summer Nights,"Summer came and left without a warning
All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before

Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh

305,One Step Up,"[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, the house was cold
Checked out the furnace, she wasn't burnin'
Went out and hopped in my old Ford
Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'
We've given each other some hard lessons lately
But we ain't learnin'
We're the same sad story, that's a fact
One step up and two steps back

[Verse 2]
Bird on a wire outside my motel room
But he ain't singin'
Girl in white outside a church in June
But the church bells, they ain't ringing
I'm sittin' here in this bar tonight
But all I'm thinkin' is
I'm the same old story, same old act
One step up and two steps back

[Verse 3]
It's the same thing night on night
Who's wrong, baby? Who's right?
Another fight and I slam the door on
Another battle in our dirty little war
When I look at myself I don't see
The man I wanted to be
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back

[Verse 4]
There's a girl across the bar
I get the message she's sendin'
Mmm she ain't lookin' too married
And me, well, honey I'm pretending
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms
The music was never-ending
We danced as the evening sky faded to black
One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back
One step up and two steps back

Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants

Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Get us out, so someone can gun us down

Now we one song away from tearing the club up

Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat

Gotta make you understand

[Verse 1]
Your destiny’s in yo hand inner strength a Conan
Too much time in the hood will have u programmed
Or in ya cell writing a kite listening to slow jams
The 2-3 ain't workin' on me they gotta go man
I got the ball movin’ I rock a small Cuban
I'm too famous to deny some of my wrong doings
Its never about what you’ve done what you can do for them
Family and friends I be done rapidly losing 'em
Look at they name think about it before deleting it
Before you sit down at the table watch who you eating with
Hopefully those ain't the people that you competing with
Too focused to quit my journey before completing it

It’s a difference between what you doin' and what you tryna do
Price you pay for not being humble is astronomical (sky high)
Especially when you in the jungle what would the lions do
If you can do the math on that then do the science too (yeah)
Move around wit the four pound or a nine or two
Hometown hate I receive ain't worth responding to (no!)
I'm the one that made them believe in a Yonkers dude

315,Like A Child,"[Intro]
Today, you are who you are today. See?
You're still me, but you're a newer version

Myself ten years from now
It's so far away
It's almost impossible to imagine
Am I alone or is there a wonderful person next to me?

[Verse 1]
Back back in the day
When they all kept laughing at me
Before I even knew I had a debt like Faye
Watching MTV, young Sway Calloway

I'm blessed
Finding a rhyme to rewind when I'm stressed
Cosign with Divine but my mind is a mess
In time I'll recline
For the moment it's retrograde
Get back to the days when I played

PS, DS, DC, GC
Had 12 permanently on the VC
RPG, level up until my MP's
High enough to get me
10 times stronger than enemies

Finna be finishing up assemblies fast like
""If we participate then we don't have to be in class, right?
Truthfully it's cool with me
I used to be a decent kid in my day

Smooth Operator like Sade
Playing Moonwalker on Friday
Little Hokage
Born to be more than he is
His sword is so worn
From the wars that he wanted to win

Cleaned his recorder again
But he didn't record at the time
It was not in his sight
When the timing is right
He'll get guided to light
By a couple of people deciding to fight

In the meantime and in between
Just checking this slime in the ice machine
If The Price is Right then I might delight
And indulge on a little bit of this and that

My hand-eye was off
Wasn't fit to bat
Couldn't shoot the shot
Never picked a mat

So to sum it up
Athletic was not me
Instead I was watching Kenpachi Zaraki
Flame

[Bridge 1: Laughing Bull & Spike Spiegel]

[Laughing Bull]
What did you see?

[Spike Spiegel]
I had a dream
It was the first time
The first that I was really scared
Shook with fear
If one thing, one atom had given way
Then I would be gone

[Verse 2]
Man I'm too young to be feeling this old
My fire's too bold to submit to the cold
Don't know if I'm growing or going
Some go with the wind I just flow in the moment

I know my opponent
We share our components
I roll with my sensei
I can't be a ronin
I think it's time that I find my way
The sky might fall but it's fine by me

Learned so much in a year or two
The fact that I'm living's a miracle
Coming in with the revenge of General Chao
Like jiu mo gwai gwaai faai di zau

Got talismans if I'm wrapped in sin
I don't even know which one to pick
It's hard coming back again
Feeling like Richard Pryor on the Sunset Strip

Recently I've just been learning some lessons
The heart is a part that gets burned a second
The brain is the key but it doesn't get credit
The rest of our parts, we don't give any mention

And we all want love
Regardless of whether or not we admit it
Whenever we don't then we need it the most
But it's in those times that we hardly ever give it

I'm livid
I can't express my emotions
The way I've been hoping
So now I feel like they don't get it

Man it's so hard to explain
How my heart and my brain
Are still one in the same but so different

Think about suicide less but I still think of death
I confess, and I bet that they pivot
Harder to trust if I never got off of the bus
And I know that it's enough to rivet
KiDD

[Bridge 2]

[Laughing Bull]
Know this Swimming Bird:
This blue eye percieves all things conjoined
The past, the future, and the present
Everything flows and all is connected
This eye is not merely seen reality
It is touching the truth

[Spike Spiegel]
Yeah... I see what you mean

[Verse 3]
Will I get a job that I hate to do
And in 18 years go back to school?
Or lose my cool and act a fool
Go the reunion like

""Look what they made me
I've really gone crazy""
Or maybe I'll be
Performing on stages amazing to me
I really don't know
Confused on which path that I will choose go

Oh well, so swell in the life of me
Never been great but I'd like to be
Really don't talk much but I might decree
If I could I'd live just like Han-Jee

Ainz
But it just won't work that way
And I have to accept it
No skill when the times get hectic
I could send a message
But there is no telling who stuck around

Time is my friend when I'm down
It's also my enemy
I'm trying not to make a sound
So they don't finish me

Got to gather up my energy
Feeling like Trunks with infinite ki
But this disease is sickening me
I need to travel cryogenically

Wake up to Logic on Paradise vibing
I'm using my noggin' like Batman and Robin
They say that they're mobbin'
They're probably lying
I'm trying to master the timing

Of looking ahead of it
My soul is so delicate
Play the role of a delegate
I'm Delico mixed with a little bit of Eren Yeager
I don't think you know who you're messing with
Him

[Outro]

Knowing me
I'm sure you're causing all kinds of trouble
For lots of different people
I'm sorry, I don't mean to, but it's all right
That's part of life too isn't it?
You're not perfect but you've got a lot to give
So remember
I'll always be cheering you on

In your time
I'm no longer here but I am here today
And I'll always be cheering for you right here
Cheering for you

318,Out Of The Blue,"[Verse 1]
Out of the blue, it all changed in an instant
He was nineteen when she told him she was pregnant
Barely out of high school, living in a small town
Neither of 'em had a job or money in the bank
He got work on the factory floor
Struggling to make ends meet but she adored him
Always in his corner when her parents started on her, like
""He won't ever amount to that much""
The baby arrived, really, they tried
She said, ""Let's do the best we can, a day at a time""
He started staying out all night, getting drunk
Convinced he couldn't deal with what he had and what he'd done
He lost his job and that was no surprise
She said, ""I can't go on watching you destroy your life
You need to get it together or I'm leaving with our kid""
He said, ""It's probably best if you left,"" so she did

[Chorus: Kaity Dunstan & Joelistics]
So when you gonna learn?
It'll hit you hard
Even if it hurts
And it always does
So when you gonna learn?
Let it in your heart
We come together and fall apart
Out of the blue, my love

[Verse 2: Joelistics]
Five years later and she's living in the city
She'd severed all contact to her old life
Her little girl's at school, and she was working days
Staying up late and studying through the night
Out of the blue, he called up and they talked
He said he'd got a job up north on fishing trawlers
He hadn't touched a drink, for two years, he'd been clean
Plus he saved some money on the side in between
He cleared his throat, made an awkward joke
And asked, ""Maybe I could come and visit you both?
But only if you think it's alright, I mean""
She said she'd think about it, the next day, she agreed

[Chorus: Kaity Dunstan & Joelistics]
It'll hit you hard
Even if it hurts
Like it always does
So when you gonna learn?
Let it in your heart
We come together and fall apart

Out of the blue
Out of the blue
Out of the blue, my love

[Verse 3: Joelistics]
He got on a plane and flew across the desert
Watching as the world flew by
It felt like he held his breath from the airport
All the way to her front door the whole time
He knocked soft and she opened up
And they looked at each other, both dumbstruck
Each waiting for the other one to speak first
But neither of 'em could find any words, then
Out of the blue, as if on cue
Trying to hold back the tears in their eyes
And with a voice full of cracks and a heart fit to burst
She said, ""Well, you took your time""

[Bridge: Kaity Dunstan & Joelistics]
These moments make up a lifetime
Mistakes we make are not fixed in stone
People we love are a lifeline
And none of us can do it on our own
Out of the blue
Out of the blue
Out of the blue, love saves us
Out of the blue, we all learn that lesson

INT. SEMYON HOUSE - BEDROOM

Frank and Jordan are lying next to each other in bed.

FRANK: How’d a water stain get there?

Camera cuts up to two brown stains on the ceiling above Frank.

FRANK: It rained maybe twice this last year. It’s like everything’s papier-mache.

JORDAN: Stop thinking.

FRANK: I don’t like being on a ledge.

JORDAN: Nobody gets rich on their own money,

FRANK: I never really knew what to do with it. Money.

Camera cuts to show the outside of Frank’s house.

FRANK: I see that about myself.

JORDAN: You always said you want lots of land.

FRANK: Yes, but you need children to leave it to. It’s never really yours. You don’t take it with you.

JORDAN: You don’t take anything with you.

FRANK: Just yourself. Whatever that was.

JORDAN: I’ve worked my whole life. Same as you. And not being poor is better than the opposite.

FRANK: My old man back in Chicago, when I was a kid… (laughs) he used to lock me in the basement when he’d go on a bender. Usually last the night. Let me out the next day. Thought he was keeping me safe, I guess. This one time, I was six - he puts me down there. I wake up and it’s locked. It had happened before. Anyways, so I guess he ended up arrested, I guess.

JORDAN: God, baby.

FRANK: Well, by the second morning I was out of food. The third day the light bulb burnt out. Pitch black in there. That’s when the rats started coming out. I dozed off and I felt a thing nibbling my finger. I woke up, it was, you know, chewing my finger.

JORDAN: What did you do?

FRANK: I grabbed it in the dark with my hands, I started smashing. And I just kept smashing it until it was nothing but goo in my hands. 2 more days I was in there. In the dark. Til my dad comes home.

JORDAN: Sometimes I wonder how many things you have like that. That I don’t know about.

FRANK: Ever since, I wondered: what if he never comes home? What if I’m still in that basement in the dark? What if I died there? That’s what that reminds me of.

JORDAN: What?

FRANK: The water stain. Something’s trying to tell me that it’s all papier-mache. Something’s telling me to wake up, like… like I’m not real. Like I’m only dreaming.

Cut back to the water stain. The cut to--

INT. MORGUE

Close up on Ben Caspere’s head and empty eye sockets.

CORONER: TOD between 4:00 AM and 9:00 AM morning of the 26th. Tox shows Xanax, alcohol, also had gonorrhea, for what it’s worth. Hydrochloric acid on his eyes. Burn pattern tells us he was on his back. Lack of spray around the orbital cavity indicates precision. Some kind of glass eyedropper, maybe.

Cut to Velcoro and Bezzerides inspecting the body.

INT. VENTURA COUNTY HQ - CONFERENCE ROOM

COMMANDER O’NEAL: He’s our body. I don’t see that changing, so why don’t you all fill me in?

STATE ATTORNEY DAVIS: Victim is a key witness in a state’s investigation.

POLICE CHIEF HOLLOWAY: What state’s investigation?

STATE ATTORNEY GELDOFF: Newly formed. We’re looking into various allegations made against Vinci in the papers.

LIEUTENANT BURRIS: Vinci detectives have been eyeing Caspere as a missing person for 2 days. We have the man’s house which was burglarized. You want to shut us out, we’ll continue our investigation autonomously. (gestures to O’Neal) So everybody can keep their little corners to theirselves, but, ladies and gentlemen, PD is solving this case.

HOLLOWAY: I understand Ventura. How’s the state have any claim here?

DAVIS: Our officer found the body.

INT. ELEVATOR

DAVIS (O.S.): This could get you out from under, Woodrugh. That actress bullshit.

INT. HESCHMER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

DAVIS: You’d be detailed as a state’s investigator.

GELDOF: The Caspere homicide is your public investigation. Looking into Vinci PD is your confidential mandate. Gathering intel for a grand jury. This probe is very important to the governor’s office.

COMMANDER FLOYD HESCHMER: Say this goes your way. How’s it play for my boy here once the dust settles?

DAVIS: Everything shakes out, you’ll be offered a chance to remain investigator. In line for a state detective shield. We can wipe away all that admin hassle.

WOODRUGH: When this is over - can I just go back to being on the bike?

INT. MORGUE

CORONER: You can see abrasions on his wrists and ankles, lividity on his torso. He was bound. Upside down. Or close to it.

INT. COMMANDER JAMES O’NEAL’S OFFICE

O’NEAL: Attorney general’s office has concerns about obfuscation on the part of Vinci PD.

DAVIS: Detective Bezzerides, you’ll be primary commander of the detail. Secondary is gonna be a Vinci guy, Velcoro. Your DB was into a lot of LA County money. His house was broken into, so you’re going to Vinci. Vinci detective with you? Word is he’s bent. Work him. Leverage something to turn him. We’ll have a full state probe up inside a week. Caspere’s death is a window into anything.

BEZZERIDES: And what is everything, exactly?

DAVIS: You know anything about the city of Vinci?

EXT. VINCI - TRAIN TRACKS

A group of kids are running around in the sludge being dumped into the street.

DAVIS (V.O.): It started out as a vice haven. Early 1900s. Went industrial in the ‘20s. Pushed out residents from manufacturing zones. Worst air polluter in the state. Annually emits or processes 27 million pounds of toxic waste.

INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE

MAYOR CHESSANI: Reds tried to stop my grandfather from industrial rezoning. Same thing. Geldof’s been after us since we won the last EPA suit. It’s about money, Detective Velcoro.

BODINE: Caspere was one of the architects of the community renewal initiative. Passing legislature, our city gets to keep 75% of its county tax revenue for eight years.

VELCORO: And what’s that worth?

BODINE: About $900 million. Being kept from the county general fund.

CHESSANI: Hell, Ernst, it’s our money. Vinci’s a goddamn success story in a depressed economy.

BURNS: State’s gonna use the homicide to dig into whatever they can, Ray. Wherever the Caspere case goes, we need you running point.

HOLLOWAY: Control the sprawl. Control the flow of information. Dixon is secondary to you staging out of Vinci.

BURNS: You’ll be working under a Ventura detective commanding the task force. That clear to you, detective?

VELCORO: 10-4, lieutenant. Just one question - am I supposed to solve this or not?

CHESSANI: (laughs) Just no surprises, detective Velcoro.

BURNS: Ray accepts dualities must be effected to serve public interests.

VELCORO: I really do.

BEZZERIDES: Bound?

CORONER: Vinyl fabric. You can see the edge of the buckle’s imprint on both wrists. Tape residue.

The coroner lifts the blanket covering Caspere to reveal a bleeding crotch.

CORONER: Pelvic wounds are from a 12-gauge at point-blank range. Some kind of Super-X heavy load. Came after the eye stuff. Official COD is heart attack. Trauma-induced.

VELCORO: A coup de grace.

CORONER: Lividity indicates he was placed in upright position after death. Spent a few hours that way. Nothing under his nails, no prints.

BEZZERIDES: No trace at all?

The coroner shakes his head then leaves. Bezzerides, Velcoro, and Woodrugh exchange looks in the coroner’s room.

EXT. VINCI - TRAIN TRACKS

FRANK: His eyes? What the fuck kind of modus operandi is that?

VELCORO: Doc says it was hydrochloric acid. And a shotgun blast happened.

FRANK: Torture. Somebody wanted to know something.

VELCORO: Yeah, his house was tossed.

FRANK: Somebody’s making a move.

VELCORO: What? What does that mean? You knew Caspere?

FRANK: There’s deals being done upstate. A lot of money moving around.

VELCORO: What deals?

FRANK: You pull my string? Is that how this works?

VELCORO: Jesus, Frank. Not a smart decision, man. The more I know, the better I can deal with this.

FRANK: This is what you deal with. Caspere was important to this thing I have going on. I’ve got to clean it up now. So you beat the bushes until you figure it out. You ain’t no sheriff’s brownie. You’re a detective. Who’s your best informant?

VELCORO: Are you serious?

FRANK: Fucking hell, Raymond.

Frank and his man get in the car and leave. The kids that were playing in the sludge start shouting in the distance.

VELCORO (to kids): (whistles) Vaya! Vaya! Peligro!

One of the kids raises both middle fingers to Ray.

VELCORO: Yeah, yeah. That’s right. Fuck me.

INT. WOODRUGH TRAILER

CYNTHIA WOODRUGH: So good to see you. Why don’t you visit me more?

WOODRUGH: Just busy. The job.

CYNTHIA: The job. We haven’t had dinner in ages.

WOODRUGH: That’s why I brought you this, ma.

Paul hands her a bucket of fried chicken.

CYNTHIA: It’s too late for us to start all that now.

WOODRUGH: Well, you ought to eat something.

Paul puts two pieces of fried chicken on a plate for her.

CYNTHIA: Oh, I don’t touch bread. Peel that skin off for me, Paulie.

She sits down next to him and starts feeling his muscles.

CYNTHIA: So strong. I saw your old prom date the other day. She got fat.

WOODRUGH: I remember her. Couldn’t wait to have somebody’s baby.

CYNTHIA: She was nice.

WOODRUGH: She was nice to me.

CYNTHIA: (laughs) All the girls are nice to you, Paulie. You haven’t figure that out by now? Want to stay tonight? We can watch a Clint movie. You can have your old room.

WOODRUGH: I’m working on something. Just came to see--

CYNTHIA: Who is she, you scamp? You rake. You got hound’s blood. Just like your daddy.

WOODRUGH: I’m not gonna be around for a while. I’ve got to work around LA and the coast.

CYNTHIA: (nods) Special detail.

WOODRUGH: Mm.

CYNTHIA: Then stay. We can play cards. You can have your old room.

Paul goes silent.

WOODRUGH: You been getting more shifts at the restaurant lately?

CYNTHIA: Not with my carpal tunnel. I’d lose my state check anyway.

WOODRUGH: I thought Bill was letting you work off the books?

CYNTHIA: Oh, Bill? Don’t talk to me about that motherfucker.

INT. WOODRUGH TRAILER - LATER

Paul and Cynthia are watching a movie together.

MAN ON TV: Are you gonna give yourself up? Or do this the hard way?

MAN #2: There ain’t no easy with me. You know that.

MAN #1: Damn. I so hate making a mess. A lot of paperwork, you know? It messes with you.

MAN #2: Screw you. I did my time in prison.

The movie plays as Paul smokes a cigarette.

EXT. CASPERE HOUSE - DAY

An officer lifts the tape to allow Velcoro and Bezzerides to enter the house.

INT. CASPERE HOUSE

Velcoro and Bezzerides walk through the house. A camera clicks as they walk by the scattered portraits of naked women.

OFFICER: We’re listing contents against insurance audits. See what was stolen.

Bezzerides nods then starts looking through the place.

VELCORO: Well, somebody was looking for something. Would explain the torture.

BEZZERIDES: Maybe. Guy really thought about fucking a lot.

They both stare at one of the portraits hung on the wall.

INT. CAR

Ray taps on the roof of the car as Ani smokes an e-cigarette.

BEZZERIDES: Do you mind?

Ray stops tapping. He looks down at Caspere’s date book.

VELCORO: Psychiatrist appointments. He was seeing a shrink.

BEZZERIDES: We need to call every appointment in that calendar. Should check all those circled dates against his GPS.

RAY: Yeah.

The car drives by a group of people standing outside of a factory. Ani takes a drag of her e-cig.

RAY: You know you pull of that e-cig. Not a lot of people do.

BEZZERIDES: This day gets a day-to-day flux of 70,000 people, right? Where do they live?

RAY: I tried one once. It felt like I was smoking me. A real cigarette wouldn’t make you feel like that. Maybe it’s just too close to sucking a robot’s dick. I don’t know.

INT. FACTORY

Frank and 2 other men walk by the whirring machines and enter the factory.

FRANK: Caspere was my bank on this thing. My disposal company set this up. Chemical runoff. We took the risk.

JACOB MCCANDLES: And that risk afforded you the chance to buy into the corridor. But I’m telling you that buy was never made.

FRANK: Caspere had me down for 12 parcels below Monterey.

MCCANDLES: Frank, I can only account for what purchases Caspere completed.

FRANK: Are you saying that I--

LAWYER: Mr. McCandles. Mr. Caspere had effectively sold Mr. Semyon the land while acting as a short term holding company. All we’re trying to do is ensure the deal for our parcel goes through despite Caspere’s tragedy.

MCCANDLES: If you got this transaction legally documented, it shouldn’t be hard.

LAWYER: You know we have issues.

FRANK: If we had a fucking paper trail we’d be doing this through banks.

MCCANDLES: Well, otherwise, I’d say you’re in the unenviable position of being owed money by a dead man.

FRANK: That’s $5 million of my money.

LAWYER: Hold it. We were given to understand that our partnership was with Catalyst.

MCCANDLES: Had Mr. Caspere made payment, it would have been. (looks to Frank) And your name would have been added to the corporate charter for development. But he didn’t.

FRANK: How do I know that?

MCCANDLES: We’re not gangsters, Frank.

LAWYER: This is unacceptable.

MCCANDLES: Since Caspere’s remaining interests have been voided, I can provided you the same parcel. Same price. Seven million.

FRANK: The same? We were given 10.

MCCANDLES: Not by me.

McCandles walks out of the door to his car. Frank follows after him.

FRANK: Motherfuck. Motherfuck me.

Frank and the lawyer approach Caspere while he waits for his limo.

FRANK: We sold off our Vinci assets to put in with Caspere and… I went liquid for this deal.

MCCANDLES: What can I tell you, Frank? It sounds like Mr. Caspere was playing fast and loose with your capital. I can offer you the buy-in again, but it sounds like you’re short.

FRANK: I can get it back.

MCCANDLES: Find another stake, it’d be worth your while. Excuse me.

McCandles opens the limo door, gets in, then rides away.

LAWYER: Shit. Seven, he says?

FRANK: Seven’s the same as ten to me at this point. Can’t round off zero.

INT. CAR

Frank crushes a pair of eyeglasses in his fist then sighs.

FRANK: Am I diminished? Is that my message to the goddamn… My business partner takes my money, gets tortured and murdered, and what? I’m waiting on this Velcoro burnout to make like Rockford? (scoffs) Get everybody. Stan, Iver, his cousins, our Glendale people. Fucking Blake, wherever the fuck he’s been.

LAWYER: Frank, we can look at your remaining assets.

FRANK: I don’t have any fucking assets. The house and the poker room were double mortgaged. This was fucking everything.

LAWYER: That’s what you meant. Frank, why did you--

FRANK: Leave it. I’ll get it back. Every dime.

INT. MAYOR CHESSANI’S OFFICE

CHESSANI: That was maybe a month ago. September. Celebrated breaking ground on the Red Line extension and the imminent production of a major Hollywood movie. Big news for the city. And Ben had a hand--

BEZZERIDES: Could you tell us anything about Mr. Caspere’s demeanour at the party? Was he with someone? A date?

CHESSANI: A woman he had been seeing. I think. I can’t quite recall her name. Ernst?

BODINE: A Miss Tascha I believe, sir.

BEZZERIDES: He see a lot of girls? Enough that you wouldn’t know her name?

CHESSANI: I believe Ben maintained an active social life. We didn’t often cross paths that way. We only met over business.

VELCORO: You wouldn’t have any pictures from the party, sir, by any chance? Something to help us identify the girl?

Bezzerides smiles.

BODINE: Mr. Caspere was dedicated to his community.

BEZZERIDES: A community of 95 residents.

VELCORO: He didn’t seem distressed by anything  last you saw him?

CHESSANI: No, just the usual headaches. County can’t forgive our independence.

BEZZERIDES: And you didn’t talk to him much outside of business get togethers?

BODINE: And cabinet meetings, occasionally.

VELCORO: Well, thank you Your Honor. That’ll do us.

BEZZERIDES: Do you recall what time Mr. Caspere left your house the night of the party?

BODINE: I believe around 11. Maybe 12. Around the time things broke up.

BEZZERIDES: With Miss Tascha?

VELCORO: Thank you, Your Honor.

CHESSANI: Thank you, Detective. I’d like to see this solved as soon as possible.

INT. WAREHOUSE

Dixon is seated in front of a bulletin board with Caspere’s name on it and boxes of evidence.

WOODRUGH: Got his train records. Phone calls. Don’t know if he had any of the lines, though. Starting to think he must have kept other accounts.

DIXON: Hey, kid, just save it for the debrief. Why are you here? You ain’t even an investigator, right?

WOODRUGH: Special detail. State owns the case. Found his lawyer, too. Had to hump all over LA for this shit. Oh, and this one fag, at the bank, tried like hitting on me. Almost clocked the guy.

DIXON: Yeah? Why would you do that? Hey, no trouble here, stud. Just leave me out of it, all right?

Bezzerides and Velcoro enter the room. Bezzerides is holding a folder, Velcoro has a box full of evidence which he puts next to Dixon. Ani opens the folder.

BEZZERIDES: His insurance had these forms. Items likely stolen from Caspere’s place, we can put out pawn sheets on them. (to Dixon) What did you guys get?

DIXON: The young man here, he got a dynamite anecdote.

WOODRUGH: Last withdrawal was 5 days ago. Nothing jumps except this. Once a month, $4,000 cash withdrawal.

Velcoro walks over to the forms Bezzerides is holding.

VELCORO: Let me see this.

Ray flips through Caspere’s calendar. Once a month, he sees a day around the 20th of the month circled, with nothing scheduled for that day.

RAY: These withdrawals seem to come around the time of these blank days in his calendar.

BEZZERIDES: Did you get his GPS?

DIXON: Yeah. Here. (hands her papers)

BEZZERIDES: There’s nothing on those dates. Car didn’t go anywhere. Says his Mercedes was a lease.

VELCORO: Well, that makes sense.

BEZZERIDES: Not city. Catalyst Group.

VELCORO: Why’d Catalyst lease him a car?

DIXON: (gets up) Maybe somebody should call them.

Dixon walks out of the room.

BEZZERIDES: You tight with him?

VELCORO: I’m not tight with anyone.

WOODRUGH: Can I pick up here tomorrow?

BEZZERIDES: Sure.

Woodrugh walks out of the room. Velcoro gets up.

VELCORO: I gotta go.

Ray starts walking towards the door but sees Ani is still studying the papers furiously.

VELCORO: What?

BEZZERIDES: These coordinates. They’re up North. Monterey county, Fresno, Gilroy. A lot of them on weekends.

Velcoro and Bezzerides study the form together.

EXT. SCHOOL

Ray slams his trunk closed and starts walking towards the school. He sees his ex-wife standing where he usually picks up Chad.

VELCORO: Hey. Where’s Chad?

GENA: He’s not coming.

VELCORO: What? Why?

GENA: You’re gonna ask me why? Really? You fucking prick?

VELCORO: What, that thing at the school? I apologized to Chad and it’s between me and him.

GENA: That’s not the end of the story, and you know it.

VELCORO: How’s that?

GENA: The police said that someone beat up Wit Conroy. Said it had something to do with a schoolyard altercation.

VELCORO: Well, I don’t know anything about that, but sometimes a good beating provokes personal growth.

GENA: It’s not like you know any other way, right? Goddamnit. Chad gets anxious when he has to be around you. Do you get that? Do you even see it?

VELCORO: That’s bullshit. I-- we talk, we build models, we write letters, I got him this recorder

GENA: And how many times has he written you back?

VELCORO: He needs me, all right? Even if he doesn’t know it. And if he gets anxious it’s probably because he knows he’s gonna have to listen to his mom talk shit about his dad.

GENA: You’re bad, Ray. You’re a bad person. And you’re bad for my son.

VELCORO: Don’t say that. You know me. We had something, and... What I done for you, things started to slip away from me--

GENA: No, you didn’t do that for me, Ray. Don’t you dare say that you did that for me.

VELCORO: I had a right. By any natural law, I had a right.

GENA: I came to tell you this in person. Richard didn’t want me to. I’m getting an emergency write for supervised visits.

VELCORO: What? No.

GENA: We’re petitioning for sole custody.

VELCORO: What? No. Why?

GENA: Because this can’t go on. It can’t. I mean, look at yourself.

VELCORO (panicked): You will not… no. Please, please don’t.

GENA: You used to have something. A decency. You were good at being decent until something happened. You were fine as long as everything else was fine. But then something, and you weren’t strong enough to stay decent. And now--

VELCORO: You won’t get away with it. I will burn this entire fucking city to the ground first.

GENA: I’ll petition for a paternity test, too, Ray. If you make me.

VELCORO: Don’t. Please. Please don’t. Don’t do that please. Goddamnit, he’s, he’s all I-- alright, I’m a piece of shit, but that boy’s the only thing I have in my entire shitty life.

GENA: I know, babe. Then don’t you know he deserves better?

Gena walks away. Ray starts hyperventilating as parents and their kids walk by.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE

A car bumper is dented.

MAN IN SUIT: Oh, fuck. Son of a bitch. Some asshole just rear-ended my car. Look you mother-- Ahh!

He is pepper sprayed in the eyes. Two men start beating on him.

Fuck. Son of… Oh, fuck.

IVAR: Next time, we put you in trunk.

Ivar punches him in the face then drives away. Frank, wearing dark shades, walks over.

FRANK: Jesus, buddy, what was that about?

MAN: Oh god, thank you. Fucking me.

FRANK: Why would somebody come after you like that, guy? I mean that was crazy, right?

MAN: I don’t know, they just--

FRANK: What did you do to piss somebody off? Can you think of anything?

MAN: What does that mean?

FRANK: I don’t know what that means. I’m asking you. What you might have did to get guys like that after you.

MAN: Wait, do I know you?

FRANK: I’ve never seen you before, but I saw the whole thing. And I wish we could figure out what you did. Like some kind of behavior that guys like that would have issue with. Like mouthed off or made a gesture, or you run a book in Vinci sweatshops.

The man looks up at Frank, panicked.

MAN: What? Is that what this is?

FRANK: Is what what what is? Is that what you think it is? It just seems to me like you’ve pissed off some serious people. Maybe you ought to take more care. Just a thought, pal.

Frank pats him on the shoulder then walks away.

EXT. PITLOR HOUSE - DRIVEWAY

Ray and Ani pull up to Dr. Pitlor’s gate and address the guard.

VELCORO: Velcoro and Bezzerides to see Dr. Pitlor. We called ahead.

INT. PITLOR HOUSE

A receptionist walks Ray and Ani to Dr. Pitlor’s room. They walk by someone in a bed with their face bandaged up.

VELCORO: You do surgeries here?

RECEPTIONIST: Only cosmetic. The clinic employs a small group of medical professionals who cover a variety of services.

INT. PITLOR HOUSE - DR. PITLOR’S ROOM

PITLOR: This is quite a shock.

VELCORO: Anything he might have told you that indicated trouble, enemies?

PITLOR: The reputation of this clinic rests on its discretion, Officers. Confidentiality.

He puts a finger to his lips.

BEZZERIDES: Your patient was murdered. He’s got no living family.

Cut to Velcoro.

VELCORO: Somebody burned out his eyes with acid, Doc.

Bezzerides gives him a look and he shrugs.

PITLOR: Well, of course I am willing to help. I would hope I can, at least.

BEZZERIDES: What were you treating him for?

PITLOR: A number of things. Neuroses. Anxiety. A painful past - like many.

BEZZERIDES: Guilt over what?

PITLOR: Ben had a weakness for young women. Paying for them, more specifically. He frequented escorts, although it ignited in him tremendous shame and self-loathing, which resulted in further damaging tendencies. Old cycles.

BEZZERIDES: How long had he been seeing you?

PITLOR: About three years?

VELCORO: Was he making any progress, his therapy?

PITLOR: I like to think so. His relapses were less frequent and he didn’t compound them with further damaging behavior.

BEZZERIDES: His habit, did he ever mention any girls by name? Favorite service? Favorite girl?

PITLOR: No, not that I recall, but I’d be willing to go back over my notes.

VELCORO: What about the name Tascha? He ever mention her?

Pitlor shakes his head no.

BEZZERIDES: Did he ever mention violence? Trouble with a girl, a pimp?

PITLOR: He was sexually obsessed, but he was not aggressive. More… passive.

Bezzerides looks to Pitlor’s desk and sees a mineral rock and other clutter.

PITLOR: That’s about as detailed as I’ll get airing Ben’s personal issues.

BEZZERIDES: This was helpful. Thank you.

Bezzerides and Velcoro get up. Pitlor takes off his glasses.

PITLOR: Your ID said Antigone Bezzerides. Are you related to Elliot Bezzerides by any chance?

BEZZERIDES: You know him?

PITLOR: I used to, a bit. A long time ago. I did some social theory with the good people. He had a daughter, I remember. Good lord, was that you?

BEZZERIDES: I left all that behind. It was a fucked up place.

PITLOR: Well, all kinds of secrets in the world. All kinds of truth.

BEZZERIDES: Five kids living there when I was growing up. Two are in jail now, two committed suicide. How’s that for social theory?

PITLOR: And the fifth?

BEZZERIDES: She became a detective.

Bezzerides and Velcoro exit the room.

INT. CITY HALL

Frank walks through the halls of city hall.

GELDOF (on TV): To curb public speculation in this homicide, it’s become necessary to announce that our offices are conducting a criminal probe into the incorporated city of Vinci in LA County. This investigation is long overdue.

Cut up to Mayor Chessani watching the TV. The door opens.

INT. MAYOR CHESSANI’S OFFICE

Frank enters the room.

GELDOF (on TV): And we ask all state and city officials to co-operate.

Frank walks to Chessani’s desk.

CHESSANI: Attorney general just announced a shakedown.

Frank drops a envelope full of money on the table.

CHESSANI: You’re not supposed to bring that here.

FRANK: It’s short 10.

CHESSANI: When you took over from Gene Slatterly, we established terms. Short wasn’t part of it, Frank.

FRANK: I’m pulling some things together. Adding revenue streams. I just need a couple of weeks. I sold the rent farms and waste disposal business to pull together the corridor money. You know that.

CHESSANI: You still owe the poker room kickback. Sell some of that land if you need to.

FRANK: Caspere died with my money in his pocket.

CHESSANI: I’ve had outside interest, re: the poker room. Think they can turn a higher gross. Higher vig.

FRANK: What outside interest?

CHESSANI: Just so you know. It’s a seller’s market.

FRANK: You seriously gonna bust my balls over 10 Gs? I kept this place tight as a drum six years. Who squashed the undocumented workers alliance? That hit and run? Your son’s face was so coke-dusted he looked like a clown.

CHESSANI: (laughs) Tony, yeah. My son, I fear, is losing his fucking mind. Like his departed mother. Some people can’t handle the deep trip. I fear he is a destroyer. In my day, you understand, it was about consciousness expansion, tracing the unseen web. Children are a disappointment. Remain unfettered, Frank.

FRANK: They closer on who killed Caspere?

CHESSANI: Catalyst is taking over his action. Everything’s happening. My farkakte offspring I will set up with a club in Oakland. Let him be a boy prince elsewhere.

FRANK: Whoever killed Caspere, they have my money.

CHESSANI: How’s that?

FRANK: The holding company is empty. The land was never purchased and I’m fucked out of my life’s work. Now I need a direction to turn, Austin. Or I may just start pulling down walls.

CHESSANI: That doesn’t sound like a smart play, gever. Innuendo is nobody’s friend.

FRANK: You’re not worried who did Caspere might be part of something bigger? Muscling in on the corridor. Secret handshakes and whatnot.

CHESSANI: Ben had his own charity, and what punched his ticket could have come from some personal pocket. Nobody muscles me, Frank. State attorney will get his piece, Caspere will get closed, the world will turn uncaring of our struggles.

Frank stands up.

FRANK: They turn Caspere, I want a tip. I want time alone with the guy that did it.

CHESSANI: You are industrious, Frank. I want to see you make it through this.

FRANK: Who wants the kickback on the poker room?

CHESSANI: Kickback’s an extra 15 next week, Frank. 22.50 the week after. You don’t come through then, I have to entertain other interests. It’s business.

FRANK: (nods) Sure.

Frank exits the room.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

VELCORO: Now this is making some sense, right?

BEZZERIDES: It explains his home decor.

VELCORO: Nine to one the cash withdrawal every month was a hooker blowout. Guy’s regularly in touch with criminal elements. Pimps, they break in, tortured him somewhere. Probably trying to get access to assets.

BEZZERIDES: I think it’s more twisted than that. What was done to him, that shit in his house. He’s into a lot of stuff we’re just scratching.

VELCORO: Well we can have Woodrugh work prosts, escort services. He’d be smooth for that.

BEZZERIDES: Sure.

VELCORO: You know that expression about flies and honey.

BEZZERIDES: Mm. The fuck do I want with a bunch of flies?

VELCORO: Well, you don’t have flies, you can’t fly-fish.

They sit in silence until they pass workers at work in a factory.

BEZZERIDES: What is this fucking place?

VELCORO: Suburban flight. Heavy manufacturing moves inland or overseas, plants close. Except here, a bunch of good capitalists ran in for cheap leases, tax incentives, immigrant labor, sweatshop economics.

BEZZERIDES: You don’t have a problem with that?

VELCORO: No. My strong suspicion is that we get the world we deserve.

BEZZERIDES: Why are you here? This place?

VELCORO: I did time in the LA Sheriff’s. I just needed better pay. Regular hours. I had a son.

Ray pauses.

VELCORO: They told you about me, I’m sure.

BEZZERIDES: Yeah, bosses said you’re a solid investigator.

VELCORO: I know you wouldn’t think it, but I don’t bullshit.

BEZZERIDES: What would you say if you did?

VELCORO: Can I tell you what you may or may not have heard, but almost definitely will hear about my busted marriage? Rumors have me killing this piece of filth hurt my wife. Same rumors put me in hock to a Southland mob. And if you know who to ask, you might hear I like to get wet now and then from a number of bad habits.

BEZZERIDES: Any of that true?

VELCORO: Oh, yeah.

BEZZERIDES: Which parts?

VELCORO: Bad habits. Never lost one yet. You?

BEZZERIDES: Oh, I don’t distinguish between good and bad habits.

VELCORO: What’s with all the knives?

BEZZERIDES: Could you do this job if everyone you encountered could physically overpower you. I mean, forget police work, no man could walk around like that without going nuts.

VELCORO: So they’re equalizers. Makes sense.

BEZZERIDES: No, I’d still them if I wasn’t on the job. Fundamental difference between the sexes is that one of them can kill the other with their bare hands. Man of any size lays hands on me, he’s gonna bleed out in under a minute.

VELCORO: Well, just so you know, I support feminism. Mostly by having body image issues.

A beat.

VELCORO: What’s that thing Pitlor mentioned? Your dad, the Good People?

BEZZERIDES: It was, like, this commune around Guerneville in the late ‘70s, ‘80s. Hippie shit.

VELCORO: You had to look out for yourself, huh?

Bezzerides takes a turn then starts pulling over.

BEZZERIDES: That’s you.

Ani comes to a stop at Ray’s place and lets Ray out. Ray starts walking away then turns back.

VELCORO: Look, I’m trying to effect transparency between us. The reason being… I don’t know if you know this, but us, the investigation, I don’t think it’s supposed to work.

BEZZERIDES: Why is that?

VELCORO: State attorney’s investigation. They must have tapped you. You know, the kid, too. Why wouldn’t they have a team of state jury investigators working Vinci instead of just you and the kid. Why wouldn’t the SA do a full court press on this?

BEZZERIDES: (sighs) You want honest? Tell me, how compromised are you?

Ray gives her a long look but says nothing.

VELCORO: Anyways, good night.

Ray walks to his house. Bezzerides pulls out of the driveway.

INT. BEDROOM

EMILY: What is it? Why didn’t you tell me?

She hands Paul her tablet.

WOODRUGH: What the fuck.

Paul checks the tablet and sees a headline “CHP Elicits Sex For Letting Lacey Lindel Off?”

EMILY: Hmm?

WOODRUGH: ‘Cause that right there is a bunch of unbridled bullshit. You read about the girl. Goes to jail for one more fuck up, tries to say I did something wrong. That’s it.

EMILY: Then why didn’t you tell me?

WOODRUGH: ‘Cause I don’t want to think about it.

EMILY: Are you gonna lose your job?

WOODRUGH: No. I got a new placement through the state’s attorney. I’m gonna be a detective after.

EMILY: Listen, this paper talks about you being in this Black Mountain Security thing.

WOODRUGH: I told you, I don’t talk about the desert.

EMILY: But this Black Mountain Security, they did things, bad--

Paul gestures for her to be quiet then heads to the bathroom.

WOODRUGH: Come on. I just told you I gotta go to LA to work for a while. Special detail. Special investigator. That’s it.

EMILY: God, you smell like a bar rag. They say vodka don’t smell but that’s bullshit. You smell just like my uncle.

WOODRUGH: I gotta go.

EMILY: Mhm?

WOODRUGH: That’s it.

EMILY: And you apartment?

WOODRUGH: Still there, Em.

EMILY: What are you doing? I can’t do this anymore. I tried.

WOODRUGH: It’s work. It’s a good thing, Em.

EMILY: No. You barely talk. I don’t know your family. You don’t want to know mine. Who are you?

WOODRUGH: Oh, fuck off. Who the fuck am I supposed to be.

EMILY: I don’t know who you’re supposed to be. Jesus Christ. Yeah, fuck off. Go! God, whatever happened to you, I can’t fix it.

WOODRUGH: There’s nothing wrong with me. I’ll call you this weekend.

EMILY: Don’t. I don’t want to hear from you, Paul. You can’t give me more than this. You’re not… You’re not right. Sometimes I’m with you and I can tell that… fuck it.

WOODRUGH: I gotta go.

EMILY: Don’t come back.

WOODRUGH: It’s on you, not me.

Paul exits the house.

INT. CLUB

Frank walks through a dimly lit club. A man motions him towards the VIP lounge and a bouncer lets him in.

DANNY: Frank! Surprised you’re visiting this pit you stuck me with. It’s hard work up in here!

FRANK: I gotta say, being back in here, I don’t miss it. Seems like a headache looking back.

DANNY: Fucking right it’s a headache. Vendors, purchase orders, licenses. Every one of these bitches think this is “Pretty Woman.”

FRANK: I need to know if any of your girls knew a guy liked young trim.

INT. CLUB - LATER

Frank shows a picture of Caspere to one of the escorts.

ESCORT: Maybe about a month ago. He booked a date at his place.

FRANK: In Vinci? The big house?

ESCORT: No. This place small. In Hollywood. Took-over home.

FRANK: You remember where it was?

DANNY: Go ahead, girl. Speak.

ESCORT: I’ll write them down. Danny says you pay attention to streets, always know where you are.

FRANK: This guy, he do anything scary? Anything might have pissed somebody off?

ESCORT: No. He kind of… weak, you say? Just want to watch.

FRANK: Write it down where you met him.

DANNY: I hope this goodwill does not go unnoticed on your part, Frank. Everybody needs friends, see?

Danny smiles and reveals his grills read “FUCK YOU.” Frank smiles.

INT. BEZZERIDES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Ani talks on the phone while she surfs on her laptop.

MAN (over phone): This is Hollywood Division Vice Squad. Please leave your message after the beep and we’ll get back to you. (beep)

BEZZERIDES (over phone): This is Detective Bezzerides with state police detail 93009. I was hoping to speak with a vice detective--

The phone beeps.

WOMAN (over phone): If you are satisfied with your message, press one.

Ani presses one then hangs up. She starts surfing on her laptop. She ends up on a website called Cali Angels, with an ad promising “Cali Angels for Any Taste or Need.” She scrolls down the page, sees pictures of naked women, then clicks and starts watching a porn video. Her phone rings and she answers it.

BEZZERIDES: Yeah?

ELVIS: Yo, you remember that missing girl? I talked to her old roomate. Said Vera last called her a couple months ago. Asked if anybody had come around looking for her. I checked her phone records and a call came from a Guerneville address. How’s it going down there?

BEZZERIDES: It’s a pain in the ass, you know? Not much so far. It might be a hooker job, some pimp. Let me let you go. Catch up tomorrow?

ELVIS: Sure.

BEZZERIDES: Bye.

Ani hangs up then goes back to staring intently at the porn video.

EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

Woodrugh watches a group of girls running down the street. A car pulls over across the street and lets a man out. Woodrugh takes a sip of beer and stares at the man.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

SINGER: “You were a loner. You were alive. Among the walking dead. He was a liar. Would not atone. Still leaving tonight…”

Frank sits down in the booth across Ray and hands him a piece of paper.

FRANK: How’s that for detecting? Caspere had another house. Place he brought girls.

VELCORO: You check it out?

FRANK: No. I don’t want to go near it. And my people ain’t exactly proficient in evidence handling. Figured you go in as police, see what I might need to know. Grab anything that pushed towards Caspere’s dealing with land purchases.

VELCORO: Yeah, what’s going on with that?

FRANK: Money. Place is about to be worth a whole lot more.

VELCORO: This is Hollywood.

FRANK: So? Listen, I’ve been wanting to ask you, things shake out like I expect, this time next year you might be Chief of PD -- Vinci. How’d that be?

VELCORO: Chief? I don’t want that, Frank.

FRANK: Did I ask you if you want that? What’s up with you, huh? I’m lining stuff up for you here. That job pays $300K a year. You could hire a hell of a family lawyer for that. That. Right there.

VELCORO: You remember how we got together?

FRANK: I remember you dumping a body.

VELCORO: The reasons for all this, all that, might not exist for me anymore. You see? I got no reason to keep at this.

FRANK: Meaning you’d consider life in prison, what, a positive?

VELCORO: No, I ain’t saying that either.

FRANK: What, you have some other options here I’m not privy to.

VELCORO: Everybody’s got the one option, you want it bad enough.

Frank shakes his head.

FRANK: You used to be a hard man.

VELCORO: I’m tired.

FRANK: Then get some sleep. After you check the place out. Get back to me. And Ray…

Frank places a stack of dollar bills on the table then gets up.

FRANK: I don’t want to hear you talk like that again.

Frank leaves the restaurant. The waitress with the scarred face walks to Ray’s table.

WAITRESS: You want another beer, Ray?

RAY: No, I… I gotta take off I guess.

Ray starts finishing his beer.

WAITRESS: He’s keeping you busy.

RAY: Yes ma’am.

She sits down at the booth across from him.

WAITRESS: You ought to take some time. A vacation. Have you ever been to San Miguel de Allende.

RAY: No.

WAITRESS: That’s where I’m from. Mountains, waterfalls, this plaza.

RAY: That sounds really nice.

WAITRESS: Maybe I could show it to you sometime.

RAY: I think the only way I get a vacation is if I croak.

WAITRESS: You should get another job, then.

RAY: It’s too late for that, darling. That and about a million other things.

Ray gets up.

WAITRESS: Your money.

RAY: That’s not mine.

Ray walks away.

SINGER: “I love you baby like a miner loves gold. And this way you’ll never grow old. The noose recovered. Church and worms.

EXT. CASPERE HOUSE - NIGHT

Ray gets out of his car and walks to the door.

INT. CASPERE HOUSE - NIGHT

Ray enters the house. The faucet is dripping and sink is overflowing. “I Pity The Fool” is playing in the background.

Ray turns the light on and inspects the house. He opens a door to find electronic equipment. It starts clicking and Ray exits the room. As he turns, a figure appears in the background and shoots Ray in the chest with a shotgun from a distance. Ray writhes on the floor, and a man with a raven’s mask walks up to his body and shoots him in the chest point blank.

320,Breakaway,"[Verse 1]
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray) I could break away

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

[Verse 3]
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

[Bridge]
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

[Chorus 2]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never thought that I would get caught
It seemed like a perfect crime

Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree

[Verse 2]
I thought it would be so simple
Like a thousand times before
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy
Go ahead and throw the book at me
If loving you's a crime
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be

[Chorus]
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree

Lock me away inside of your love

Still, she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know

I found someone

Well I wasn't surprised
Still, it hit me kind of hard

Could turn into miles and worlds apart

You deserve the very best

I've done some praying
Some searching for myself

    THOUGH he saw them twice daily, though he knew and amply discussed every detail of their expenditures, yet for weeks together Babbitt was no more conscious of his children than of the buttons on his coat-sleeves.

    The admiration of Kenneth Escott made him aware of Verona.

    She had become secretary to Mr. Gruensberg of the Gruensberg Leather Company; she did her work with the thoroughness of a mind which reveres details and never quite understands them; but she was one of the people who give an agitating impression of being on the point of doing something desperate—of leaving a job or a husband—without ever doing it. Babbitt was so hopeful about Escott's hesitant ardors that he became the playful parent. When he returned from the Elks he peered coyly into the living-room and gurgled, ""Has our Kenny been here to-night?"" He never credited Verona's protest, ""Why, Ken and I are just good friends, and we only talk about Ideas. I won't have all this sentimental nonsense, that would spoil everything.""

    It was Ted who most worried Babbitt.

    With conditions in Latin and English but with a triumphant record in manual training, basket-ball, and the organization of dances, Ted was struggling through his Senior year in the East Side High School. At home he was interested only when he was asked to trace some subtle ill in the ignition system of the car. He repeated to his tut-tutting father that he did not wish to go to college or law-school, and Babbitt was equally disturbed by this ""shiftlessness"" and by Ted's relations with Eunice Littlefield, next door.

    Though she was the daughter of Howard Littlefield, that wrought-iron fact-mill, that horse-faced priest of private ownership, Eunice was a midge in the sun. She danced into the house, she flung herself into Babbitt's lap when he was reading, she crumpled his paper, and laughed at him when he adequately explained that he hated a crumpled newspaper as he hated a broken sales-contract. She was seventeen now. Her ambition was to be a cinema actress. She did not merely attend the showing of every ""feature film;"" she also read the motion-picture magazines, those extraordinary symptoms of the Age of Pep-monthlies and weeklies gorgeously illustrated with portraits of young women who had recently been manicure girls, not very skilful manicure girls, and who, unless their every grimace had been arranged by a director, could not have acted in the Easter cantata of the Central Methodist Church; magazines reporting, quite seriously, in ""interviews"" plastered with pictures of riding-breeches and California bungalows, the views on sculpture and international politics of blankly beautiful, suspiciously beautiful young men; outlining the plots of films about pure prostitutes and kind-hearted train-robbers; and giving directions for making bootblacks into Celebrated Scenario Authors overnight.

    These authorities Eunice studied. She could, she frequently did, tell whether it was in November or December, 1905, that Mack Harker? the renowned screen cowpuncher and badman, began his public career as chorus man in ""Oh, You Naughty Girlie."" On the wall of her room, her father reported, she had pinned up twenty-one photographs of actors. But the signed portrait of the most graceful of the movie heroes she carried in her young bosom.

    Babbitt was bewildered by this worship of new gods, and he suspected that Eunice smoked cigarettes. He smelled the cloying reek from up-stairs, and heard her giggling with Ted. He never inquired. The agreeable child dismayed him. Her thin and charming face was sharpened by bobbed hair; her skirts were short, her stockings were rolled, and, as she flew after Ted, above the caressing silk were glimpses of soft knees which made Babbitt uneasy, and wretched that she should consider him old. Sometimes, in the veiled life of his dreams, when the fairy child came running to him she took on the semblance of Eunice Littlefield.

    Ted was motor-mad as Eunice was movie-mad.

    A thousand sarcastic refusals did not check his teasing for a car of his own. However lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of Vergil, he was tireless in tinkering. With three other boys he bought a rheumatic Ford chassis, built an amazing racer-body out of tin and pine, went skidding round corners in the perilous craft, and sold it at a profit. Babbitt gave him a motor-cycle, and every Saturday afternoon, with seven sandwiches and a bottle of Coca-Cola in his pockets, and Eunice perched eerily on the rumble seat, he went roaring off to distant towns.

    Usually Eunice and he were merely neighborhood chums, and quarreled with a wholesome and violent lack of delicacy; but now and then, after the color and scent of a dance, they were silent together and a little furtive, and Babbitt was worried.

    Babbitt was an average father. He was affectionate, bullying, opinionated, ignorant, and rather wistful. Like most parents, he enjoyed the game of waiting till the victim was clearly wrong, then virtuously pouncing. He justified himself by croaking, ""Well, Ted's mother spoils him. Got to be somebody who tells him what's what, and me, I'm elected the goat. Because I try to bring him up to be a real, decent, human being and not one of these sapheads and lounge-lizards, of course they all call me a grouch!""

    Throughout, with the eternal human genius for arriving by the worst possible routes at surprisingly tolerable goals, Babbitt loved his son and warmed to his companionship and would have sacrificed everything for him—if he could have been sure of proper credit.

    II

    Ted was planning a party for his set in the Senior Class.

    Babbitt meant to be helpful and jolly about it. From his memory of high-school pleasures back in Catawba he suggested the nicest games: Going to Boston, and charades with stew-pans for helmets, and word-games in which you were an Adjective or a Quality. When he was most enthusiastic he discovered that they weren't paying attention; they were only tolerating him. As for the party, it was as fixed and standardized as a Union Club Hop. There was to be dancing in the living-room, a noble collation in the dining-room, and in the hall two tables of bridge for what Ted called ""the poor old dumb-bells that you can't get to dance hardly more 'n half the time.""

    Every breakfast was monopolized by conferences on the affair. No one listened to Babbitt's bulletins about the February weather or to his throat-clearing comments on the headlines. He said furiously, ""If I may be PERMITTED to interrupt your engrossing private CONVERSATION—Juh hear what I SAID?""

    ""Oh, don't be a spoiled baby! Ted and I have just as much right to talk as you have!"" flared Mrs. Babbitt.

    On the night of the party he was permitted to look on, when he was not helping Matilda with the Vecchia ice cream and the petits fours. He was deeply disquieted. Eight years ago, when Verona had given a high-school party, the children had been featureless gabies. Now they were men and women of the world, very supercilious men and women; the boys condescended to Babbitt, they wore evening-clothes, and with hauteur they accepted cigarettes from silver cases. Babbitt had heard stories of what the Athletic Club called ""goings on"" at young parties; of girls ""parking"" their corsets in the dressing-room, of ""cuddling"" and ""petting,"" and a presumable increase in what was known as Immorality. To-night he believed the stories. These children seemed bold to him, and cold. The girls wore misty chiffon, coral velvet, or cloth of gold, and around their dipping bobbed hair were shining wreaths. He had it, upon urgent and secret inquiry, that no corsets were known to be parked upstairs; but certainly these eager bodies were not stiff with steel. Their stockings were of lustrous silk, their slippers costly and unnatural, their lips carmined and their eyebrows penciled. They danced cheek to cheek with the boys, and Babbitt sickened with apprehension and unconscious envy.

    Worst of them all was Eunice Littlefield, and maddest of all the boys was Ted. Eunice was a flying demon. She slid the length of the room; her tender shoulders swayed; her feet were deft as a weaver's shuttle; she laughed, and enticed Babbitt to dance with her.

    Then he discovered the annex to the party.

    The boys and girls disappeared occasionally, and he remembered rumors of their drinking together from hip-pocket flasks. He tiptoed round the house, and in each of the dozen cars waiting in the street he saw the points of light from cigarettes, from each of them heard high giggles. He wanted to denounce them but (standing in the snow, peering round the dark corner) he did not dare. He tried to be tactful. When he had returned to the front hall he coaxed the boys, ""Say, if any of you fellows are thirsty, there's some dandy ginger ale.""

    ""Oh! Thanks!"" they condescended.

    He sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, ""I'd like to go in there and throw some of those young pups out of the house! They talk down to me like I was the butler! I'd like to—""

    ""I know,"" she sighed; ""only everybody says, all the mothers tell me, unless you stand for them, if you get angry because they go out to their cars to have a drink, they won't come to your house any more, and we wouldn't want Ted left out of things, would we?""

    He announced that he would be enchanted to have Ted left out of things, and hurried in to be polite, lest Ted be left out of things.

    But, he resolved, if he found that the boys were drinking, he would—well, he'd ""hand 'em something that would surprise 'em."" While he was trying to be agreeable to large-shouldered young bullies he was earnestly sniffing at them Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time whisky, but then, it was only twice—

    Dr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in.

    He had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and Eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped. He called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield explained to Babbitt that Eunice's mother had a headache and needed her. She went off in tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. ""That little devil! Getting Ted into trouble! And Littlefield, the conceited old gas-bag, acting like it was Ted that was the bad influence!""

    Later he smelled whisky on Ted's breath.

    After the civil farewell to the guests, the row was terrific, a thorough Family Scene, like an avalanche, devastating and without reticences. Babbitt thundered, Mrs. Babbitt wept, Ted was unconvincingly defiant, and Verona in confusion as to whose side she was taking.

    For several months there was coolness between the Babbitts and the Littlefields, each family sheltering their lamb from the wolf-cub next door. Babbitt and Littlefield still spoke in pontifical periods about motors and the senate, but they kept bleakly away from mention of their families. Whenever Eunice came to the house she discussed with pleasant intimacy the fact that she had been forbidden to come to the house; and Babbitt tried, with no success whatever, to be fatherly and advisory with her.

    III

    ""Gosh all fishhooks!"" Ted wailed to Eunice, as they wolfed hot chocolate, lumps of nougat, and an assortment of glace nuts, in the mosaic splendor of the Royal Drug Store, ""it gets me why Dad doesn't just pass out from being so poky. Every evening he sits there, about half-asleep, and if Rone or I say, 'Oh, come on, let's do something,' he doesn't even take the trouble to think about it. He just yawns and says, 'Naw, this suits me right here.' He doesn't know there's any fun going on anywhere. I suppose he must do some thinking, same as you and I do, but gosh, there's no way of telling it. I don't believe that outside of the office and playing a little bum golf on Saturday he knows there's anything in the world to do except just keep sitting there-sitting there every night—not wanting to go anywhere—not wanting to do anything—thinking us kids are crazy—sitting there—Lord!""

    IV

    If he was frightened by Ted's slackness, Babbitt was not sufficiently frightened by Verona. She was too safe. She lived too much in the neat little airless room of her mind. Kenneth Escott and she were always under foot. When they were not at home, conducting their cautiously radical courtship over sheets of statistics, they were trudging off to lectures by authors and Hindu philosophers and Swedish lieutenants.

    ""Gosh,"" Babbitt wailed to his wife, as they walked home from the Fogartys' bridge-party, ""it gets me how Rone and that fellow can be so poky. They sit there night after night, whenever he isn't working, and they don't know there's any fun in the world. All talk and discussion—Lord! Sitting there—sitting there—night after night—not wanting to do anything—thinking I'm crazy because I like to go out and play a fist of cards—sitting there—gosh!""

    Then round the swimmer, bored by struggling through the perpetual surf of family life, new combers swelled.

    V

    Babbitt's father- and mother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T. Thompson, rented their old house in the Bellevue district and moved to the Hotel Hatton, that glorified boarding-house filled with widows, red-plush furniture, and the sound of ice-water pitchers. They were lonely there, and every other Sunday evening the Babbitts had to dine with them, on fricasseed chicken, discouraged celery, and cornstarch ice cream, and afterward sit, polite and restrained, in the hotel lounge, while a young woman violinist played songs from the German via Broadway.

    Then Babbitt's own mother came down from Catawba to spend three weeks.

    She was a kind woman and magnificently uncomprehending. She congratulated the convention-defying Verona on being a ""nice, loyal home-body without all these Ideas that so many girls seem to have nowadays;"" and when Ted filled the differential with grease, out of pure love of mechanics and filthiness, she rejoiced that he was ""so handy around the house—and helping his father and all, and not going out with the girls all the time and trying to pretend he was a society fellow.""

    Babbitt loved his mother, and sometimes he rather liked her, but he was annoyed by her Christian Patience, and he was reduced to pulpiness when she discoursed about a quite mythical hero called ""Your Father"":

    ""You won't remember it, Georgie, you were such a little fellow at the time—my, I remember just how you looked that day, with your goldy brown curls and your lace collar, you always were such a dainty child, and kind of puny and sickly, and you loved pretty things so much and the red tassels on your little bootees and all—and Your Father was taking us to church and a man stopped us and said 'Major'—so many of the neighbors used to call Your Father 'Major;' of course he was only a private in The War but everybody knew that was because of the jealousy of his captain and he ought to have been a high-ranking officer, he had that natural ability to command that so very, very few men have—and this man came out into the road and held up his hand and stopped the buggy and said, 'Major,' he said, 'there's a lot of the folks around here that have decided to support Colonel Scanell for congress, and we want you to join us. Meeting people the way you do in the store, you could help us a lot.'

    ""Well, Your Father just looked at him and said, 'I certainly shall do nothing of the sort. I don't like his politics,' he said. Well, the man—Captain Smith they used to call him, and heaven only knows why, because he hadn't the shadow or vestige of a right to be called 'Captain' or any other title—this Captain Smith said, 'We'll make it hot for you if you don't stick by your friends, Major.' Well, you know how Your Father was, and this Smith knew it too; he knew what a Real Man he was, and he knew Your Father knew the political situation from A to Z, and he ought to have seen that here was one man he couldn't impose on, but he went on trying to and hinting and trying till Your Father spoke up and said to him, 'Captain Smith,' he said, 'I have a reputation around these parts for being one who is amply qualified to mind his own business and let other folks mind theirs!' and with that he drove on and left the fellow standing there in the road like a bump on a log!""

    Babbitt was most exasperated when she revealed his boyhood to the children. He had, it seemed, been fond of barley-sugar; had worn the ""loveliest little pink bow in his curls"" and corrupted his own name to ""Goo-goo."" He heard (though he did not officially hear) Ted admonishing Tinka, ""Come on now, kid; stick the lovely pink bow in your curls and beat it down to breakfast, or Goo-goo will jaw your head off.""

    Babbitt's half-brother, Martin, with his wife and youngest baby, came down from Catawba for two days. Martin bred cattle and ran the dusty general-store. He was proud of being a freeborn independent American of the good old Yankee stock; he was proud of being honest, blunt, ugly, and disagreeable. His favorite remark was ""How much did you pay for that?"" He regarded Verona's books, Babbitt's silver pencil, and flowers on the table as citified extravagances, and said so. Babbitt would have quarreled with him but for his gawky wife and the baby, whom Babbitt teased and poked fingers at and addressed:

    ""I think this baby's a bum, yes, sir, I think this little baby's a bum, he's a bum, yes, sir, he's a bum, that's what he is, he's a bum, this baby's a bum, he's nothing but an old bum, that's what he is—a bum!""

    All the while Verona and Kenneth Escott held long inquiries into epistemology; Ted was a disgraced rebel; and Tinka, aged eleven, was demanding that she be allowed to go to the movies thrice a week, ""like all the girls.""

    Babbitt raged, ""I'm sick of it! Having to carry three generations. Whole damn bunch lean on me. Pay half of mother's income, listen to Henry T., listen to Myra's worrying, be polite to Mart, and get called an old grouch for trying to help the children. All of 'em depending on me and picking on me and not a damn one of 'em grateful! No relief, and no credit, and no help from anybody. And to keep it up for—good Lord, how long?""

    He enjoyed being sick in February; he was delighted by their consternation that he, the rock, should give way.

    He had eaten a questionable clam. For two days he was languorous and petted and esteemed. He was allowed to snarl ""Oh, let me alone!"" without reprisals. He lay on the sleeping-porch and watched the winter sun slide along the taut curtains, turning their ruddy khaki to pale blood red. The shadow of the draw-rope was dense black, in an enticing ripple on the canvas. He found pleasure in the curve of it, sighed as the fading light blurred it. He was conscious of life, and a little sad. With no Vergil Gunches before whom to set his face in resolute optimism, he beheld, and half admitted that he beheld, his way of life as incredibly mechanical. Mechanical business—a brisk selling of badly built houses. Mechanical religion—a dry, hard church, shut off from the real life of the streets, inhumanly respectable as a top-hat. Mechanical golf and dinner-parties and bridge and conversation. Save with Paul Riesling, mechanical friendships—back-slapping and jocular, never daring to essay the test of quietness.

    He turned uneasily in bed.

    He saw the years, the brilliant winter days and all the long sweet afternoons which were meant for summery meadows, lost in such brittle pretentiousness. He thought of telephoning about leases, of cajoling men he hated, of making business calls and waiting in dirty anterooms—hat on knee, yawning at fly-specked calendars, being polite to office-boys.

    ""I don't hardly want to go back to work,"" he prayed. ""I'd like to—I don't know.""

    But he was back next day, busy and of doubtful temper.",Sinclair Lewis,1988,"[99, 67, 52, 45, 48, 51, 61, 71, 74, 78, 91]",11

Headed for the 'Frisco bay

I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed

336,I Wasn't The One (Who Said Goodbye),"Your eyes and my eyes haven't talked in quite a while

And I think we both know the feelings haven't died

I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night
And I won't be the one to say that we can't try

Your touch and my touch haven't spoken for some time
You say we've both changed and you're always on my mind
Always on my mind... I can tell you that it's over and done
But I would only lose being close to the one that I want
So go on, and ask me if I'm still in love with you

I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night
And I won't be the one to say that we can't try

No, there was no need for you to ask
Oh please don't ask
You ought to know by now
Oh babe, I want you back

I wasn't the one who said goodbye, oh no
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who said goodbye
I wasn't the one who disappeared in the night

Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candles brighter than the sun

Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

Then hes the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile

I was mobbin' through the beach, yeah the city by the sea
Mama tried to keep me home, but I love the fuckin' streets

Couple niggas had beef so I had to Chief Keef
I got homies from the 2, I got homies from the 3
I keep everything neutral, I just wanna smoke a leaf
I was runnin' up a check, try me, he gon' get the TEC

When I'm with you, I shake inside
My heart's all tangled up, my tongue is tied
It's crazy
Can't walk, can't talk
Can't eat, can't sleep
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in deep
'Cause baby

With a kiss, you can strip me defenseless
With a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa, whoa ohh, whoa ohh, whoa

I can't speak when I look in your eyes

Romantic eyes, persuasive lips
The helpless heart just can't resist
Their power
You know you've got a hold of me
You know you've got me where I want to be

Like a wave, you keep pulling me under
How I'll ever get out of this? I don't know

340,Just Like Paradise,"[Verse 1]
After all the clouds have gone
We can get together
She mixes the pineapple with dark rum
Says it’s because of the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re burning in the sunshine
She squeezes the lime
As the DJ on the stereo dropped the bassline
She told me she’s in love
With the speaker and the sub
And reggae makes her crazy

[Chorus]
Maybe it’s your eyes, how they pull me in
Maybe it’s your skin, either way I win
I don’t even know where to begin, girl
You’re just like paradise
All around the world they look for this
A little bit of sun and a pretty miss
Here I got you both I can’t resist, girl
Just like paradise

[Verse 2]
She called me up when my watch read one
Waiting in the lobby (you know what she wants to do)
The weekend is here and the work is done
She just wants to party

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re burning in the sunshine
She squeezes the lime
As the DJ on the stereo dropped the bassline
She told me she’s in love
With the speaker and the sub
And reggae makes her crazy

Maybe it’s your eyes, how they pull me in
Maybe it’s your skin, either way I win

Here I got you both I can’t resist, girl

Plan every minute of our whole lives
We used to talk about it all night

Bright sunny days, dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Colors of the rainbow are so pretty in the skies
Are also on the faces of people walkin' by
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin', ""How do you do?""
They're really sayin', ""I love you""

342,Never Die Young,"We were ring-around-the-rosy children
They were circles around the sun
Never give up
Never slow down
Never grow old, never ever die young

Synchronized with the rising moon
Even with the evening star
They were true love written in stone
They were never alone
They were never that far apart

And we who couldn't bear
To believe they might make it
We got to close our eyes
Cut up our losses into doable doses
Ration our tears and sighs

Oh, you could see them
On the street on a Saturday night
Everyone used to run them down
They're a little too sweet, they're a little too tight
Not enough tough for this town

Couldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole
No, it didn't seem to rattle at all
They were glued together body and soul
That much more
With their backs up against the wall

Oh, hold them up
Hold them up
Never do let them fall
Prey to the dust and the rust and the ruin
That names us and claims us and shames us all

I guess it had to happen someday soon
Wasn't nothing to hold them down
They would rise from among us like a big balloon
Take the sky
Forsake the ground

Oh, yes, other hearts were broken
Yeah, other dreams ran dry
But our golden ones sail on, sail on
To another land beneath another sky

(Let other hearts be broken
Let other dreams run dry)

But our golden ones sail on, sail on
To another land beneath another sky
Beneath another sky

Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up
Hold them up

Don't let them fall)",James Taylor,1988,"[88, 80, 82, 85, 88]",5
343,Savin' Myself,"Seeing you today
Was quite a surprise
And when you saw my friend
You couldn't disguise your feelings
Even tough you broke my heart
I guess you thought I'd always love you
Now it hurts
That I found someone new

What did you think I would do?
Sit all alone by the telephone?
Wait for the day that you might come home
Savin' myself for you

Now did you really believe
I never looked at another guy
C`mon that night and you sit to cry
Savin' myself for you

After you were gone
I realized my life was moving on
You`d be surprised
How quickly people start to come around
You'd never know that I'd be lonely
Couldn't help fall in love again

What did you think I would do?
Sit all alone by the telephone?
Wait for the day that you might come home
Savin' myself for you

Now did you really believe
I never looked at another guy
C`mon that night and you sit to cry
Savin' myself for you

Now you gave your heart to someone else
And threw our love away
So I found myself for another love
And I know it`s gonna stay",Eria Fachin,1988,"[95, 71, 55, 50, 54, 64, 65, 73, 78, 87]",10
344,Pump Up The Volume,"[Verse 1]
If we don't win the ballot it's back to the Bush
Building African Deathstar that callous your children's swollen stomachs
Pushing in a presidential palace, big cigars ablaze
No need for the suitcase we already dug the graves
And those punks work like slaves. (chop chop)
So then we let the machetes coup de grace
200 million barrels a day was all we saw
One monkey don't stop one show (no way)
Back in business, see that pipeline knocked? I control the flow
Let Switzerland hold the dough
Tel Aviv will grind anything we get out those mines
Get Washington on the satellite phone, promise a price freeze
Guarantee the safety of Royal Dutch Shell employees
Increase the Mobile Exxon concession
And send our militias more weapons
Purge the unions, assassinate the students, but keep promising elections
I don't want to turn on the BBC and see anything about repression

[Hook]x2
They fly by in bullet proof Benzes
Gucci aviators with the mirrored lenses
Sipping Champagne in the Seychelles
Living like this boy you do get expensive

[Verse 2]
The village stands in the midst of
Such rapacious pillage we live with
Murky rivers oil spillage
Around here it's never dark, we live in the sparks
Perpetual gas flames look like rusted Olympic torches
Black gold medalist on derrick platform surrounded by armed forces
The last thing we need is another daughter
Don't drink the water, don't breath the air
Don't talk to any reporters, tape recorders
Special forces is the only one with cold beer and fresh vegetables
Knocking late at night cold fear grips your testicles
Pushing in asking for you her and him
They got lots of questions about what you were doing with them
And who told who what when

346,"Century's End (From ""Bright Lights, Big City"")","[Round 1 - Iron Solomon]
I ain't gon' rap 'bout your background or origin
Cause I don't have to rap 'bout the band now to score a win
And I ain't gon' put Diddy in my lines to chalk him out...
Who the fuck am I kidding, that's all I'm gonna talk about!
That MTV show we all thought was a sham
But your no-name wack rappers were the fraudulent scam
Only kept you on the show cause you fought with your hands
Couldn't make one single good song with your fam
And Puff got the nerve to call you a band?
Your shit flopped, you get dropped, you call him your man!?
You quit rap to pitch crack, you call that a plan!?
I've seen the piff bags this kid has, you call that a gram!?
So now he wants to face the greatest, trying to get a million views in
But even if he win tonight, the kid'll still be losing
Puff a paper gangster and I bet he really screwed him
Whatever dough he make tonight, Diddy's still recouping
See, for you, signing with Puff, was like getting fucked by Lexington Steele
But Ness Lee still squealed like ""Thanks Puff, that's one heck of a deal!""
Singing ""Do wah diddy, diddy, dum diddy do""
But you owe Diddy 'til Diddy's done dicking you
So now he begging Puff for a second chance at the game
""I'll learn to sing, I'll dance in the rain, at least put me in Danity Kane!""
Then he make a blog complaining and bitching about different shit
Begging Puff for his walking papers but Diddy won't let him dip
So now he's back to claiming Bad Boy and swinging from Diddy's dick
Just to come to battle this sucker had to get a permission slip
See Ness walk to Brooklyn, see Ness walk home
See Ness braid Sean's hair and fetch Sean's combs
See Ness' ashy kneecaps and scuffed-up calves
From kneeling down, blowing smoke up Puff's ass
See, Ness makes music that's blunt guts trash
So when he played his two hits for Puff, Puff passed
So now your whole life is a big fat mess
Dropping mixtapes that couldn't have an impact less
Getting food stamps mailed to your chick's address
Still sad cause you failed on them gym class tests
You a tax write-off, Puffy gets that check
Then spends your advance on a big black Lex'
Get a fitted hat next, that look Tic-Tac fresh
To match his Sean John shirt that says ""No Bitch Ass Ness""
So he googled ""nerdy white battle rapper"", thinking he got my number
Not knowing he'd been watching Soul Khan all summer
No one's scared of you, Vanessa, it's not no Wonder
You about as real as Robert Downey, in Tropic Thunder
You silly big willy, you faker than Milli Vanilli
You don't really think you a killer, do you, Magilla Gorilla?
See, this Jew could face off with Adolf and still not take a loss
So, I don't need to let the eight spark to outline him in gray chalk
I hope you came equipped with a plate and fork
'Cause what I'm delivering is straight talk
I usually drive to Junior's, but this shit is a cakewalk.

[Round 1 - E. Ness]
I told myself if he said one word about my fight with Fred
I'd stick a fuckin' Rambo knife in his head, yeah
Cause ain't no way this cracker getting this bread
I'mma long-dick and drop-kick his bitch out the bed, yeah
So it's me against the great white hype
With bright lights on South Beach, that's fight night
This time y'all better have my fucking mic right
Cause when I kick a fucking hole through his chest it's night-night
So what your life like?
Cause for the right price, I'mma do him like Suge did Vanilla Ice-Ice
Let him go, fuck it you never know
Cause when you skip town, I'm still around, I'm letter O
I'll call dap and doe like it's John McEnroe
I'm about to serve his ass back to the white rapping show
You've been cruising for the bruising, I've come to this conclusion
You picked me out to be the one to give you this contusion
This is not an illusion, so there's no confusion
Fuck you, your man and the entire movement
Fuck it, the day you was born, let's get to it
You was hoping the airplane crashed that I flew in
So you wouldn't have to face me, but after this they gon' hate me
For baking imitation Slim Shady
Solomon, how many swords you've been swallowing?
Let me find out it's my name you've been hollerin'
Cut off his oxygen, Sugar Ray Robinson, I'm Allen Iverson
Cross him out his Wally Moccasin
Keep your fucking mouth shut, I'll shoot your mama house up
And gangbang that bitch cause I know she don't get out much
The battle shit is ours
And you know the loudest one in the room gon' be the coward
Pushin' up flowers, pullin' on sour
'Bout smack this little Backstreet Boy from out his trousers
Wowser, while they give me Doogie Howser
I'mma let the uzi holla at his medulla oblongata
Tell Andy Milonakis I'm shootin' in his pockets
Like I'm shooting for the rockets
Put two up in his noggin, he knew I was a problem
But fuck he ain't train hard
You so fuckin' wack I don't have to play the race card
To keep it real you wasn't even on my radar
When it's all known the only way you'll perform is at the gay bar
I'll be at the car lot, shittin' on this mallcop
When time share, I'll be at Time Square when the ball drops
You had your run son but this is where it all stops
I ain't wastin' no time, I know a soft spot
I'll chop your fat ass up into tupperware
And walk the streets of New York like I don't fucking care
I got the hawk and the revolver like a buccaneer
I'll get to cuttin' niggas up in here like a musketeer
See, you lame fucks always say the same stuff
It never change up, think it's a game 'til them thangs bust
Just like when Mayweather fucked Sugar Shane up
Except you get the same exact feeling from a cocaine rush
Fall back, he ain't all that
Before his face run smack into my baseball bat
I'll have him leaking out his baseball cap
With more skids than a race car track
The only time he travel is when he go to battle
Over 99 percent of the time, he's playing Scrabble
But if I see you up in Philly I ain't woppin' at you
I just say ""Look, there go the worm from the rotten apple.""
Yeah I got that cheesecake, let the desert eag quake
Clap until his knees break, like I won a sweepstakes
Got Philly chopped like it's all about a cheesesteak
But just one week in them streets will make you see straight
Ain't no fuckin' hold on, stay and get stole on
And get your fuckin' roll on and so fourth and so fourth
Push your fuckin' top back, T-Pain hot pack
Bitch I want my spot back, ain't nothing that could stop that

[Round 2 - Iron Solomon]
I feel like I'm at the gym and there's this little kid that I'm boxing with
Who's about to piss his pants to get a chance to mix up mittens with Solomon
And I'm holding back cause I know the fact this one good hit'll demolish him
I even let him win a little to give the kid a good sense of accomplishment
Like ""Good job Elliot, you really did good shit!""
When really I'm thinking ""Your breath smells like Big Foot's dick.""
And as far as me getting fat, you know the reason I'm gaining weight?
Cause my hunger's doing what these other loser's training ain't
And your slut, she just gave me brain
And her mug looks like a baby ape
So this gut was my saving grace cause it covered her crazy face
So you damn fuckin' right I stay fatter than the next dude
And I'mma keep eating rappers, it don't matter what the venue
If it's beef that you after, I'll add it to the menu
But Ness, you a snack I'll take a nap and then digest you
See Jin was my appetizer, now I'm eating my next course
But people keep asking what am I competing with Ness for
I say ""It's easy to lap this guy, so to me this is just sport.""
And your career on tracks has died so I'm beating a dead horse
E Ness, you seem stressed, your career has regressed
You washed up and depressed, you need to press reset
You drink beer and chief cess, you pop pills and eat X
Boppin' your CD Ness, what we press is eject
From whores giving him free sex, on tour living in freakfests
Now you're living in p-jects, P.Os giving him pee tests
From just getting your feet wet, to dry snitchin' to detects
Like Jigga man Jay-Z said ""You're living with some regrets.""
Bad Boy destroyed your career, G Dep
Now you surround yourself with queers, Key West
Someone convinced you to battle here, Drect
By putting funny little things inside your ear, T-Rex
I know your people warned you Ness ""Whitey's ill Och, beware.""
But I'm going easy on you Ness, you mine as well not be scared
Plus I'm gonna win either way Ness, you mine as well not prepare
They just wanna see me anyway Ness, you mine as well not be there
See this kid is an illusion to me, but on the internet he's googling me
Take your Blackberry out bitch, twitter that you're losing to me
Cause they're saying you're standing there for nothing was just wrong
Cause I guess Michael Jordan always needs someone to dunk on
And if I ain't the Jordan of the shit, there's no one that's closer
So I'll just go like this, and you go like this, and pose for the poster
But if you was LeBron James, then I'd be Dwayne Wade
We both graduated at the same time from the same grade
He was at the head of the class, on TV with celebrity acts
But that champion ring was one thing you never could grasp
I was slightly rated lower, had to fight to gain exposure
And that might have made me slower but now I have taken over
And I'm down in Miami's Heat, living my boyhood dreams
And for you done what I've done, you'd have to join my team
You a pissed off pipsqueak floating up shit's creek
The goals that you've had for your life, I reached this week
See, my career's beginning to grow, yours beginning on it's decline
In here I sit on the throne, you sittin' on the bidet
Because you ain't stackin' no more paper, your crap just got flushed
You ain't droppin' no new shit, your ass is washed up

[Round 2 - E. Ness]
From Philly, Pistolvania, to live at Grizzlemania
With a bag full of dust I bought all the way from Cambria
From 5th street, hotter than fish grease
So you fuck with D.M.C. who dick you on this week?
More powerful than Soloman, stronger than King Sampson
He got a following, fuck it I wouldn't chance it
I cut the music back up, I kept jammin'
Like I ain't hear him talking 'bout money, them niggas scrambling
I got word when I was in the spot gambling
How they hype his white ass up like he the champion
But what you really lookin' for is a companion
Somebody he can show how to fish and go camping
I can write out swiggly, slow jam 'em
Catch him with the right hand and reprogram him
To beat me, you gotta worship the Devil
I mean really know that nigga on a personal level
You can call me Magneto, how I work with the metal
We can settle out of court, pitchfork and a shovel
They told me $2,500, I said nah I ain't want it
But fuck it, I'll fly down just to punch him in the stomach
Push a couple buttons, keep the money comin'
I ain't chasin' youngin round, that nigga 100 miles and runnin'
You get it? That nigga Young Miles scared
For the fact that I'm a fuckin' werewolf out here
And I'm chewin' silver bullets, I advise you not to pull it
Now them funny punchlines ain't gon' work here, will it?
Kap I warned y'all, why you bring this cornball?
All way down Miami just to get his head torn off
I know you really want to call me a nigga
But you won't cause if you do it'd be a one-hitter quitter
Go and speak that bullshit on Twitter
I'mma ball you up and roll you in the Schuylkill River
Fuck he think he John Wayne? Nigga it's LeBron James
And times changed, I'm playing with the Heat and that's the mindframe
And I'm smoking haze, county called Dade with Dwayne Wade
I don't think we on the same page
So I'm teaching you a lesson, this a 2-11
So I'm shooting in the direction of your little rooting section
It's sad but it's true, you mad cause you poo
Me losing to this Jew'll be the last thing I do
It's the scab on the sore, the ass on the horse
All you do is talk shit and peel off when it's war
It's big shit, Terminator part 4
Bullets through his car door, fold him like cardboard
You wanna get hardcore? But you a sophomore
I'll pull out the deuce-deuce, Hit 'em with a hard four
For dickeating every rapper in sight
This the 40-year old virgin looking back at his life
Trying to gamble when you lost, now he passing the dice
But you can add a couple more hickeys after tonight
Don't talk about me getting choked out
That'll get you mowed out
Found with dick up in your mouth up in the dope house

[Round 3 - Iron Solomon]
So it wasn't Drect, it was Kap that was the Grind Time boss that was calling you
$2,500? That's all that they offered you?
If Tyler Perry produced Shrek, they'd probably cast you, Ness
'Cause you look like a fat Ninja Turtle with two necks
You like a cross between RuPaul, and a cue ball
So they take sticks to his face the second he steps in a pool hall
See, you acting bigger, but this action figure's too small
What I'm flipping gonna kick him into a box like foosball
Far as gangsters, you the biggest bitch of the century
This ain't even my verse, I'm just reading the words to his Wikipedia entry
It also said, you work at 7/11, at age 9 had sex with your reverend
And Lloyd Mathis was born in 1977
You were a 70's baby? And you 33 now?
You know where real rappers' careers should be when they're 33? Wow!
When Nas was 33, he premiered ""Hip-Hop Is Dead""
Now Ness is 33, his career in hip-hop is dead
When Jay was 33, Hov worked to build the Blueprints
When Em was 33, he'd sold 30 million units
And Biggie Smalls' status as a legend's quite clear
And when he was 33, he'd been dead for 9 years
And in 33 A.D., Jesus and Judas died
So in his 33rd year, E. Ness gets crucified
So now you can finally see through Jesus' eyes
How to be on the losing side of getting beat by a Jewish guy
Now y'all tell me which one would seem like a huge surprise?
Seeing a genius get stupefied or watching this geezer get euthanized
See I should whip yo' ass worse, but this geezer back hurt
So, since I'm in my prime, and you've peaked and passed yours
I'mma do some old-school shit, how MCs of past worked
And I'mma need the crowd's help, y'all repeat my last words
See, E. Ness got signed to Bad Boy by Diddy (Diddy)
But he don't make that real hip-hop like Biggie (Biggie)
So his whole rap catalog amounts to failure (Failure)
Y'all think I'm winning this battle right now say ""Hell yeah!"" (Hell yeah)
You know that feeling deep down inside while I spit my quotes?
Like you're the only one on the outside, of an inside joke?
That's cause this my throne, nah, this my home
I got mini-mes who would slaughter you, you couldn't diss my clones
I know some spitting pythons who be getting they rhyme on
Way better than E. Ness, my list is six guys long
The six men who recite songs better than you is Mysonne
And the top five are Dylon, Dylon, Dylon, Dylon, and Dylon
Battling me in Grind Time dawg is like facing Neo in Zion
I'm like some brand new linoleum, a fresh can of krylon
I'm them two turntables young Primo had his eye on
I'm the first time anyone turned Rakim's mic on
And as far as up-and-comers, I've followed them all
And honestly dawg you'd get abolished by Hollow Da Don
You couldn't trade words with Aye Verb, Okwerdz or Passwurdz
You'd get defeated from Concieted, demolished by Dizaster
(Even though he's a bitch)
You ain't nice as Madness, that's why you mad Ness
Compared to Arsonal, you horrible, don't try to match wits
And that don't even get to include Clips, Math
Nocando, X-Fact, Thesaurus to Illmac
Loaded Lux, I add the total up and you dead last
Right after Jae Millz, and MOOK's bitch ass, easy!

[Round 3 - E. Ness]
They like ""Your majesty, we need another strategy
We duplicate his style then try to mix it in with Cassidy's""
They got the nerve to think the shit gon' work actually
Catastrophe, now his whole career is a tragedy
I'm stuck with what I'm stuck with, cause I don't suck dick
Still write Puff shit, but I ain't with the fuck shit
And motherfuck an album, my name still good
I still walk around the hood with my chains like I should
It's Slingshot, I wouldn't change if I could
Representing me unit with my name on the wood
You could team up with Okwerdz, Dirtbag, and Soul Khan
You still wouldn't blow with an Eminem co-sign
I cop a squat and take shit on your goal line
You wake up from a coma and walk straight into a clothesline
Took 8 weeks just to write that trash?
Rip the pages out your notebook and wipe my ass
Smear the shit all in your face and say ""You like that grass?""
Chain swinging like Pacquiao, and it's lightening fast
Y'all ashamed of y'all real name
Cause that's why y'all niggas real lame
Cause all you do is dick-eat, bag-bite and steal game
But you can take your best shot cause I don't feel pain
We gon' still be in southern California, it's gon' still rain
Hit 'em with the kill-shot, way up on the hilltop
You ain't been on fire for awhile and I'm still hot
Nah, I don't deal rocks, I be in the chill spot
With highs so my lil' niggas suave when it still pop
This what you laughin' for? This what you askin' for?
The .44 turn Drew Carrey to Drew Barrymore
Sharp as a thumbtack, kick him in the nutsack
And use it as a flap to keep the dust out his butt-crack
You think it's all gun talk? Think it's all birds?
Think it's all metaphors? Think it's all words?
Two major record deals, workin' on my third
I got a 9th wonder catalog that niggas ain't ever heard
This faggot wear glasses, so fuck the scare tactics
Y'all lookin' at the next contestant on Fear Factor
So from this point on, and here after
He should be B.F.Fs with the StairMaster
It's been awhile since I got in the gym, calisthenics
See how much fat I could trim
Got your back against the wall, I got my back to the wind
He gained 700 pounds, I'm still fatter than him
My bitches wouldn't look at you, probably throw a hook or two
When god made weirdos, he threw the fuckin' book at you
I know your folk back home, they was pushin' you
But deep down inside you know I end up cookin' you
Now pick another route cause you never had clout
And while we're on the subject let's talk about his spouse
I'll fuck her in mouth, fuck her in the house
I'm skeeting on the living room, bustin' on the couch
I'm the one she fuckin' when she says she's goin' out
We even got this sex tape you don't know about
It go right stroke, left stroke
East coast, fresh coast
The bitch suck me off so long she got strep throat
Ay yo I'm super disrespectful
This .38 special put this chump underwater and his daughter in a pretzel
Niggas in my city wanna see me take an L
Cause they can't fuck with me, they just want to see me fail
They jealous of me cause they should've never fell
In the gristle while we flippin' nickles in the wishing well

How could I be so foolish (How could I)

And he's losing and he's using
And he says he's doing fine

And they look from such a height
That somehow it's all right
They're talking back to the night
It's all that they can do
Talking back to the night
It's how they make it through
If you listen you can hear them
Their voices draw you near them
They're talking back to the night for you

Something seems to take every dime the man can make
His dream is getting smaller and he wonders where to turn
And he's trying hard to make it
And he's trying not to burn

Woman never minds, pulls the shade and draws the blinds
She takes him in the darkness where the loneliest can feed
She gives him all she has to
And it's no more than he needs",Steve Winwood,1988,"[95, 68, 65, 63, 58, 57, 59, 67, 70, 81]",10

361,Be Still My Beating Heart,"[Verse 1]
Be still my beating heart
It would be better to be cool
It's not time to be open just yet
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
Be still my beating heart
Or I'll be taken for a fool
It's not healthy to run at this pace
The blood runs so red to my face
I've been to every single book I know
To soothe the thoughts that plague me so

I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart

[Verse 2]
Restore my broken dreams
Shattered like a falling glass
I'm not ready to be broken just yet
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
Be still my beating heart
You must learn to stand your ground
It's not healthy to run at this pace
The blood runs so red to my face
I've been to every single book I know
To soothe the thoughts that plague me so
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Never to be wrong
Never to make promises that break
It's like singing in the wind
Or writing on the surface of a lake
And I wriggle like a fish caught on dry land
And I struggle to avoid any help at hand

Fab - Back when income tax was all we had

Caresses fleeced you in the morning light
Casualties at dawn
And we did it all
Fab - Long time ago when we was fab
Fab - You are my world you are my only love

And while you're in this world
The fuzz gonna come and claim you
But you mo' better wise
When the buzz gonna come and take you away
Take you away, take you away

The microscopes that magnified the tears
Studied warts and all
Still the life flows on and on
Fab - Long time ago when we was fab
Fab - But its all over now baby blue

But I tell 'em, not nearly hard enough
They say, girlfriend, you know you go too far
Around the world ain't far enough

'Cause I only wanna show you what you mean to me

I may be drowning with desire from your sweet, sweet touch

And there's so much more I'd like to do

I only wanna find the love my heart's been searchin' for
I'd climb most every mountain swim from shore to shore
Just to feel the soft caress from your warm embrace
In this ocean of love, no one can take your place

Love overboard
Oh, my love's in need of help
Love overboard
Sure can't help myself

Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
So in love with you

All my friends keep telling me to let you go
Between the two of us how could they ever know
About the love you been givin'?

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk

I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Time enough to catch our breath again

And we're just another piece of the puzzle

Still we walk this road together
We travel through as far as we can
And we have waited for this moment in time

Taking in the times gone by
We wonder how it all began
We'll never know and still we
Try to understand
And even though the seasons change
The reasons shall remain the same
It's love that keeps us holding on
Till we can see the sun again

And we're just another piece of the puzzle
Just another part of the plan
And we have waited for this moment in time
Ever since the world began

And I stand alone, a man of stone
Against the driving rain
And the night it's got your number
And the wind it cries your name
If we search for truth, win or lose
In this we're all the same
The hope still burns eternal
We're the keeper of the flame

And we're just another piece of the puzzle
Just another part of the plan
How one live touches the other
Is so hard to understand

We try and go as far as we can

On a cloud of sound I drift in the night

So I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me

Told you to pray

Ah! But they never told you the price that you'd pay
For things that you might have done...

That's what I said!
Only the good die young

Send up a signal; I'll throw you a line

Never lets in the sun...

Only the good die young...
You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation!
You've got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information!
You didn't count on me-
When you were counting on your rosary
Oh woe woe!
And they say there's a Heaven
For those who will wait
Some say it's better
But I say it ain't!
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun...
You know that only the good die young!
Oh woe woe baby bay!
I tell ya only the good die young!
Only the good die young...
Said your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation!

But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

[Verse 4]
Ahhh, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

[Outro]
Look around
Leaves are brown

World in a hurry
There's more love than money changing hands

Lights out
Thinking out loud
Turn your back on the world outside

Night thoughts
No one can share
As darkness breaks through another day

Secrets
Talking out loud
Silence waits just a dream away

Forget lonely crowds, unfriendly faces
They'll soon became familiar places
Before too long, before too long

Don't be fooled by love songs and lonely hearts
You're living in a twilight world
Don't be fooled by love songs and lonely hearts

93.5 K-DAY, givin' you the taste of good life, your girl Yo-Yo
Should I say is it still all good?
Today at 12:45 outside the Petersen Museum here in Los Angeles
Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down and pronouced dead at 1:15 this morning
As a result of the ongoing feud between East and West coast
The tragic death of 2Pac Shakur who was gunned down in Las Vegas
Just six months earlier, our prayers go out to the families

[Radio Intro: Julio G]
A sad day today for the West coast, we lost an icon y'all
Eric 'Eazy-E' Wright, passed away today at 6:45 PM
Cedars Sinai Hospital, due to complications from AIDS
A definite West coast legend, brought you N.W.A.,
Brought you Michel'le, brought you D.O.C., and the list goes on
We definitely gon' miss you Eazy

[Verse 1: Game (as 2Pac)]
Picture me rollin in that black B-M-dub, headed to the club
Fresh out the Tyson fight, Beamer all rimmed up
Shinin' with the big homie, five-car caravan
Ridin' shotgun, put that chronic smoke in the air
Me Against the World is what I told my foes
So it's me against the world, 'til they poke them hoes
Leanin' out the window, flickin' ashes off the indo
Throwin' up Westside, I see, some of my kinfolk
Pull that blunt closer to my mouth 'cause only she know
I'm feelin' bad about that nigga we stomped out in that casino
But fuck it it's Death Row, the big homie never told me
That my next blow could be my fuckin' death blow
Tell Kidada I'm not ready, I ain't even let my momma know
I ain't got no kids, I'm only twenty-fo'
Before I can let the smoke out, niggas let twenty go
The thirteen that hit the car was through the passenger do'
Now come wit it

[Chorus: Latoya Williams]
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (I will always keep you near)

[Verse 2: Game (as Biggie)]
I love it when they call me Big Popp-a
I only smoke blunts if they roll prop-er
Look I gots ta, catch the first thing smokin' in Cali
And hit one of my bitches in the valley
Gotta call my nigga Sean, tell him reserve the Dom
Tell him to get the chron' and the teflon
I think they trippin' off the homie gettin' shot
But God bless his soul, Lord know it wasn't Pop
Or the M.A.F.I.A., Kim tell Cease get the fuckin' truck
We 'bout to hit the Wilshire district, get fucked up
Pop mad bottles son, twist up the Phillies
I'm thinkin' 'bout T'yanna, these niggas is lookin' silly
If this was Blooklyn I would up the 9-milli
But fuck it we to the truck, roll the dutch, we out of Phillies
Hop in the front seat, of that dark green Suburban
Heard another car swervin', gunshots close the curtains
Biggie!

[Chorus: Latoya Williams]
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)

[Verse 3: Game (As Eazy-E)]
Layin' in this hospital bed with bronchitis, I can't talk
Walked myself in and all of a sudden I can't walk
IVs in my arm, my wife Tomica at my legs
Ruthless, I mean Records, we got married on my deathbed
I could hear Jerry Heller in the hall
But I couldn't hear Cube and Dr. Dre no more at all
Through all the bullshit them niggas was my dawgs
Niggas With Attitudes spray painted on the walls
I'm flatlinin', it's bad timin'
Straight Outta Compton, the king of gangsta rap's dyin
Cause of death, the AIDS virus
Conspiracy, I guess the government just hate violence
They thought my group influenced the L.A. riots
Woulda been here to see my kids grow, if I stayed quiet
Took 12 years for a real nigga to break silence
Eazy I had to let 'em know
You could catch me, cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
And even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life

Never knowing who to cling to

That's great, it starts with an earthquake
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane
Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with fear of height, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left of west and coming in a hurry
With the Furies breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in a foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crush, uh-oh
This means no beer, cavalier renegade and steering clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, and I decline

Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
And I've been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces I've seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
It's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say

Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to make it big

Like the Spanish City to me when we were kids
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me when we were kids

She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay

[Chorus 1]

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades

I hear the wind piling up the leaves
All along the rock wall
And you, you're cracking jokes
And burning wood from last fall

Now it never snows no more
Only freezing dirty rain
Oh no, it never snows
But it gets that smell like it might
Just the same
Put your cold hands on my head
Like a blanket around my brain
Wrap a blanket around my brain yeah

Everything you wanted
More than you could handle
And the light that surrounded you
Leaves you in the dark
Staring at a candle

Roll me over, say my name
I slept right through the winter games
Wake me up, nothing's changed
I slept right through the winter games

Well your helmet, it had no scars
We leave our best coats in bars
Like ice fisherman lose cars

398,"Live My Life (From The Film ""Hiding Out"")","How do I live to be a hundred, baby?
To make sure that you grow old with me
And if we grow old, who'll be the one to stay when the other is gone?
And besides us no longer wakes up
Who'll be the one to go on after this bond we share
This beautiful romance together
And live without the other on planet disaster
We shared a few tears, but there's so much more happiness and that's all that matters

Oh, there is smoke up in the sky from the refinery
I can see it from where I recline in my balcony chair
There's a little black and white cat down there
By the picnic table he sees me and I see him
He's unaware to pollution
He's down in the weeds half asleep sniffing from the pollen
For those of you, who can't find love and are unhappy
I send you a ton
Try not to fear human connection
Somebody's out there for you
Just put your phone down
Get outside, start walking
Forget that ghost in the fog, cyber trolling
Find the kind who can share a meal without that look in their eyes that says:
""Can't wait to be bailing""
Who kinda sees the goodness in you
And you can make each other smile
A person who would drop everything
When someone who you loved died

Mh...
On the TV there is some news
A Chinatown shooter was on the loose
They caught him down near (?) and pacific
Hiding out in a place where I occasionally get my hair cut
And the other night when Muhammed Ali died
You arrived there by my side
And I was up, up, up all night
In a state and my stomach was tight
Watching the old film clips of the young and not so young Louisville Lip
Listening to Don King's spirited insights
And George Foreman's thoughts on Muhammed Ali are always a delight
And Kenny Norton ain't around to share no words, though he brake Alis jaw
And Frazier is also gone, but not Leon
Yeah, I wish they'd talk to Leon Spinks
Ali put him on the map and I'd like to hear what Leon Spinks thinks

Oh, everyday there's more bad news
Around the corner suicide bombers
Planes disappearing in the sea
And past the smoke I also see
The swaying eucalyptus trees
And come August you will see
Crape myrtles and full-bloomed (?)
Life ain't always good but many times it is, folks

Oh, the light pours in your room
From over the hill and I am glued
On my back to your soft couch
But pretty soon I must fly
I won't be back until the end of July
When I gotta go, my hearts get heavy
And it cries

Oh, how I hate these damn goodbyes
But playing music is my life
Food and water and music is what I need to stay alive

This year is gonna find me in Beijing
And Buenos Aires and South Dakota's Rapid City
And Omaha and Tucson and Phoenix
And Pluto and Mars
And Saturn and Venus
But my favorite place to be is with you in my house
Which faces west
You're coming over tonight
It's foggy and cold

I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, ""What is my purpose?""
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through

Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, ""The Devil is a lie, make a better choice""
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 3: Punch]
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?

Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, ""Is there really a God?""
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

I don't know why I like it
I just do

[Verse 1]
I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good?
I got a love of my own, babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I wish I didn't like it so much

When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around

Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

412,Lonely Won't Leave Me Alone,"(Verse 1)
Why do I seem to be
Caught up inside a dream all my life
It's always been my shadow and me
Over my shoulder
There's always a voice somewhere
Saying I never should try to set my heart free

I wish that love would come
And take me in her arms
Show me what I've never known
Where I could hold someone
And words like right and wrong
Would just fade away like yesterday

(Chorus)
Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why
Won't even let me fall in love

Oh...ho...
Everywhere I go
Always by my side
Lonely won't let me fall in love, no

(Verse 2)
I try to say I love you
But the words won't come through
In my eyes see all the tears and sad memories
Why can't I start out new
And leave that old feeling too far behind

I guess that lonely needs company

Around each bend of road
I'm thinking that in time
There will be that rainbow's end
Or when I follow those
Self illusions I find
And it's only lonely and me again, ooh...

(Chorus)
Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why
Lonely just keeps my heart out of touch

Oh...ho...
Everywhere I go
Always by my side
Lonely won't let me fall in love

(Lonely won't leave me alone)Won't leave me alone
(Lonely won't leave me alone)Oh, no
(Lonely) Won't even let me fall in love

(Lonely won't leave me alone) I wish that love would come
(Lonely won't leave me alone) Take me in her arms

Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country

And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

[Chorus]
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning Sun

[Verse 2]
When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing

I used to think that the day would never come

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion

Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear

419,Reason To Live,"[Intro]
Not everybody comes of age at the same time
But sooner or later
You're gonna start taking on responsibility
You've got to be able to carry your own weight
And when that day comes
You'd better be ready

[Verse 1]
Take a deep breath then let go
Of the life that you had known
On the first step out that door, you've started to walk down one dark road
Infection across the globe
Don't lose a grip on that hope
Think fast or you won't last long
Even when you're grown up you don't stop growing
Crazy demented faces
Nature is making changes
Ain't nothing but traces of civilization left in these forsaken places
Putting all I got at stake and praying to God it's not all wasted
Trust me you never wanna wake up
If you don't have a dream worth chasing

[Chorus]
Our time is running out
And we got nothing else
The only thing that keeps us human is each other now
Thought I could stick it out
When I was by myself
But you have given me a reason not to shut you out
There's a fire inside her
And it's made her a fighter
I will let the world burn if it means I'll survive
But the thing I'll put first is the girl by my side

[Verse 2]
Lost one too many good friends
Can't even keep track of 'em
Swept out like dust in the wind
Looks like you're the last of 'em
Even when you've had enough
I'm always gonna be there to back you up
And I'll do what it takes to keep you safe
Because I couldn't care less about the rest of 'em
Infected ones had better run
Because if they mess with us I'll step on 'em
And then quickly wreck what's left of 'em
Looking like someone dissected 'em, yep
Fresh trail of flesh and blood
And infected guts left in the mud
That we've left behind
Now that's peace of mind
If they want a fight, then we'll give 'em one
Now let them come!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A partner's only good for getting you killed
But I've been dead half my life
She is my reason to live
Even with the world crumbling down around us
We did something wrong
That you can trust me on
With all the rotten drama, hunger, war, and money gone
Everything we've built this whole entire country on
Problems that we caused
Now look what we're running from
All these broken hearts
But we keep 'em covered up
Cause even if you're weak
You gotta keep on looking tough
Fighting off the fungus is getting hard enough
But I can never wash my hands of all the wrong I've done

422,That's What Love Is All About,"There was the time
We thought our dream was over
When you and I
Had surely reached the end
Still here we are
The flame as strong as ever
All because we both kept holding on
We know we can weather any storm

Baby, that's what love is all about
Two hearts, that find a way, somehow
To keep the fire burning
It's something we could never live without
If it takes forever we can work it out
Beyound a shadow of a doubt
Baby, that's what love is all about

As time goes by we've learnd to rediscover
The reason why this dream of our survives
Through thick and thin we're destined for each other
Knowing we can reach the other side
Far beyound the mountains of our pride

Baby, that's what love is all about
Two hearts, that find a way, somehow
To keep the fire burning
It's something we could never live without
If it takes forever we can work it out
Beyound a shadow of a doubt
Baby, that's what love is all about

Ooh ridin' the good times is easy
The hard times can tear you apart
There'll be times in your heart
When the feelin' is gone
But you keep on believing
And you keep holdin' on

Baby, that's what love is all about
Two hearts that find a way, somehow
To keep the dream from dying
It's something we could never live without
If it takes forever we can, we can work it out
Beyound a shadow of a doubt

Kissed her face and kissed her head

That I'm in love with you?""

Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I got 36 styles on my mind, on my mind
Keep it real, Shaolin represent one timeeeee
All my peoples, are you with me, where you at? (Suuuu)
All my Killer Bees on attack, where you at? (Suuuu)
Throw ya fuckin' hands in the air if you want 'em near
If ya got ya gats, peel a cap for the New Year
Body devotion, what's the commotion?
Wu-Tang Clan, we attackin' your emotion
Flowin' like the ocean (bluuue)
I be comin' for your (creeew)
Flyin' guillotine (styyyle) with the new Meth-Tical
Is it goin'? Is it goin'? Is it gone?
If I ain't on ya records, then the shit ain't really on
One-man band from the Wu-Tang Clan
Ask who the man? Goddamn, it be Method
Here I, here I am in the Clan, it's essential
Puttin' Def Jam on my records, it's on

[Hook: Blue Raspberry]
Let's come together for the stimulation
Meth-Tical hit 'em with the stimulation
Can everybody feel the stimulation?
Meth-Tical hit 'em with the stimulation

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I'm here for you, son, I gotcha back
As long as you keep it real, word, I gotcha back
Brothers want the drama but don't know how to act
Until the chrome pointed at his dome head crack
Come on, let's keep it real, no disguise, recognize
I'm from a small town where ""nigga do or nigga die""
That's why I'm stressin'
That brothers keep they thoughts on they lesson
Resurrect yo' mind from the essence, for real
Ill block niggas get robbed like by the dozen
What up, cousin? Now give a pound to that lounge nigga
Peace, my MZA! Killah Hills 10304 by the GZA
Got me wideeee, it's goin' DZA
Make my way for the ooh buildin'
Now I'm chillin' with the neighborhood villains
Thug Life, it be on now
Hear the gun blaow as I milk another cow
Let the Method show you how niggas do it
I study, live the life of good, bad and ugly
Hard times caught a nigga lovely, but that ain't nuttin'
Before I die, I'mma leave the world with sumtin'
To remember me by, the real stimuli!
For you frontin' ass out rappers to capture
I rip the world apart like a natural disaster
I keep it live, somethin' born in '85
I utilize my 3rd eye, got me thinkin'
Baby, you and I should get together for whatever
You never in your long-legged life had it better
Than you got it now, we be loungin', Tical
""Word, son, I like your styleee""

[Hook: Blue Raspberry]

[Break: Method Man, overlaps Hook]
Basically, I'm here for the stimuli
To get high and for doughnuts
Meth-Tical, it's '94 and it's raw, once more

Wu-Tang Clan, forever
No, we don't die, we just multiply forever, and ever, and ever...

440,Love Will Find A Way,"[Mike Love]
I wanna be good, I wanna do better
Wanna live long, be strong, but I know I won't live forever
So while I'm alive, I'm gonna make a spark
And I hope that my life will be a light, shining bright for those who are lost in the dark

[Trevor Hall]
I wanna give Love, I wanna have patience
Wanna feel the animal within, be wild like the wind, but gracious
I'm gonna plant my seeds
I'm gonna watch them grow
And I hope that my forest will restore in us a chorus that was lost long ago

[Mike Love & Trevor Hall]
I feel the fire burning
I know the tide is turning our way, though the skies might be gray
In the distance I can see blue, the sun has got to break through someday
And all that's left to say is Love will find a way

[Nahko Bear]
Wanna hear my people singing, singing songs of redemption
Singing songs of the truth, singing songs of the peaceful warrior nation
Singing songs to the Gods, of Love and thankfulness
'Cause we are alive and we're striving to thrive and we know that we're blessed

[Mike Love & Nahko Bear]
'Cause we are the ones who come to wipe away the poison that's been seeping into the heart, that's keeping us apart
Get down to the heart of the matter, all you're gonna find out is that all that matters is the heart, and at the end of the day
Love will find a way

[All]
How we gonna get anywhere, when everybody's running in place
Are we blind or are we just scared, scared we're gonna come face to face
And have to face the things that we've done, come to terms with what we've become
Come around and fix our mistakes, only Love can find a way

[Mike Love]
When the walls are crumbling and that deadlines creeping up
When that debt comes calling, and the sky's falling from above
You can always count on Love

[Paula Fuga]
I wanna swim seas, I wanna climb mountains
Wanna make angels in the snow, dip my toes in the eternal fountain
Gonna speak the truth, and though I've told some lies
I'm gonna wear my heart out on my sleeve for you to believe the honesty in my eyes

[All]
Keep me warm Mama

[Trevor Hall]
Like a white dove of peace on a battlefield
Like a hungry, homeless man sharing his only meal
Like a man the doctor's said would die but he was healed and all he did was pray
Love will find a way

[Nahko Bear]
Like a sunbeam breaking through the storm clouds
Like an innocent prisoner breaking out
Like a warrior who wants to run in the face of fear but he chooses to stay
Love will find a way

[Paula Fuga]
Like a rose growing out of the concrete
Like a man running marathons with no feet
Like a single mother working three jobs just to put food on the plate
Love will find a way

[Mike Love]
Like a deaf man composing a symphony
Like an activist who chains herself up to a tree
Like a man who quits his job to follow his dreams without a penny to his name
Love will find a way

[All]
Love Will Find A Way

[Trevor Hall]
Like a farmer growing crops in the desert sand
Like a masterpiece painted with a crippled hand
Like a surfer towing in, wearing a grin, into a sixty foot wave
Love will find a way

[Nahko Bear]
Like a guitar player, playing 'til his fingers bleed
Like a piano man with arthritis playing 'til three
Like a singer who is hoarse but he still forces himself to take the stage
Love will find a way

[Paula Fuga]
Like a blind man seeing for the first time
Like a songwriter finding meaning in a rhyme
Like a poet who uses words as weapons and lives to fight another day
Love will find a way

[Mike Love]
Like a warm fire in winter or a summer breeze
Like a child turning her dreams into realities
Like a place where race, religion, sex or creed or class don't have a name

441,In My Dreams,"[Verse 1]
The lights are bright tonight, the music loud
A perfect mess that's what surrounds me
Then I see you over there, I can't seem to break the stare
Maybe it's 'cause your shirt is my favorite color
Then you walk on over with a smolder
And you hand me your number, I say, ""What is this?""
You say, ""Love at first sight, it exists""
But I've had my heart broken so many times before
Yeah, I've walked through so many empty doors

[Chorus]
But if I see you in my dreams tonight
Then maybe you were right
And I'll call you in the morning
If I see you in my dreams tonight
And you take my hands and tell me
""I've been waiting for you""
Then I'll tell you, ""Me too""
If I see you in my dreams tonight

[Verse 2]
I start to drive away and smile like I'm insane
How can I feel this way? I don't even know your name
The napkin doesn't say
Then I remember that I vowed not let anyone enter my heart
I say ""What is this?""
I know love at first sight can't exist

[Chorus]
But if I see you in my dreams tonight
Then maybe you were right
And I'll call you in the morning
If I see you in my dreams tonight
And you take my hands and tell me
""I've been waiting for you""
Then I'll tell you, ""Me too""
If I see you in my dreams tonight

Maybe we'll meet in a different dimension
And you can tell me all the things you didn't mention
Maybe we'll meet in a different dimension
And you can tell me all the things you didn't mention
You'll say ""What is this?""
I'll say ""I guess love at first sight exists""

[Chorus]
Cause I saw you in my dreams that night
And I knew that you were right
So I called you in the morning
(In the morning, in the morning)
Yeah I saw you in my dreams that night
And you took my hands and told me

All our hopes are rising high
Now the battles won
Brothers and sisters gather around
To change some luck
Just can't lose
When the dice go down

Spread the news all around
They've got it made in motortown

There's a new age dawning
For a friend of mine
It's a revolution
In the latest style
Nothing left but a desperate trust
Kiss that chrome
Make a wish
Before it turns to rust

Got it made in motortown
Spread the news all around
Come on down to motortown

The old steelyard
As the weeds grow high
It's a miracle, a miracle, a miracle...

Business is booming
In a come good zone
The cash may have gone
But there's hope on loan

Everybody's glory bound

Build cheap cars in motortown

452,Skeletons,"[Hook: Kaydence]
I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I look over my shoulder not knowing where it's coming from
But knowing that its coming, I was bugging as a youngin'
Now I'm runnin from, something that'll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleeding out his lungs and spitting
Do any sins go unforgiven? I hope not
Cause most of mine were hunger driven, nothing in my mother's kitchen
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hitting
So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missing
So not a chef but now the cocaine forever cooking
I love kids but now I'm selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand
Gun on my waist and, ""I don't give a fuck"" is my plan
You'll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet
Go on let shorty sing
Cause ain't no way in hell this ain't Joell, that's brave enough to tell you everything

[Hook: Kaydence]
I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it


[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Fuck all that rapping, I'mma let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'mma take a shot
And hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yeah thanks a lot, I'm a bottle-drinking nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
In order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Ain't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
That’s when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked I’s youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real, bro

I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah)

And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)

I doubt it

[Bridge]
I thought I had it all locked away till forever
But no memories fade away, They seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then whys the pain still with me?

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
See the problem is, I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there’s no remorse
Maybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus on
We could talk about pain 24/7 dog, that’s my department
Inter city blues cruise and I’m blasting that Marvin
Skeletons ain’t in my closet, that’s my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
It's all bleak to me
Tell my Pop I ain’t bothered when he don't speak to me
I love you but it’s weak to me
On one hand life is short and there’s no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog, I’m kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam, judge but you don’t understand
Me against the world, I plan on winning, know I’m undermanned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent

Feel the wind, smell the earth in the air

Project myself into what he sees

Hey

Take me away
Come on and fly me away
Take me up so high
Where eagles fly

I've always wished I could fly
The simple life of a bird on the wing
Oh Lord, I could sing

Hey, take me away
Come on, fly me away
Pick me up so high
Where eagles fly, oh yeah

Oh, yeah

I'm alive, I breathe the air
Wash the earth from my face
I catch a glimpse of another dream
I turn, I look, but there's no trace

Take me away
Come on, fly me away
I wanna fly away
Pick me up so high

465,What's Too Much,"I could feel you the moment that you walked into the room
Oh baby, oh
What I felt I wondered if I felt too much too soon
I can't help myself, something draws me to you
How in just a moment's time can all of me pursue you

What's too much
When the fascination keeps on growing by the minute
What's too much
Should I hold back something or just throw my whole self in it
What's too much

Baby you touched me the moment that I looked into your eyes
Oh baby, baby baby
I was captured by the gaze that caught me by surprise
Oh baby, baby baby
I want to pay my full attention in advance
I don't know if that's too much but I'm willing to take the chance

What's too much
What's the feeling in it telling me, is there such a rule
What's too much
What's the fine line between a wise man and a fool
What's too much

You got something that makes me give it up
I want to give you everything but maybe that's too much
That's too much

What's too much
You got something that makes me give it up
I want to give you everything but maybe that's too much

What's too much
What's the fine line between a wise man and a fool
What's too much
'Cause I'm feeling something does anyone knows how to measure

Should you try and stop it at a certain point of pleasure

466,Special Way,"[Verse 1]
I love you like a fat kid love cake
Love the way you listen to me; before you eat, you say grace
Mama called me today, told me she'd die for me
Still got love for you niggas that wouldn't cry for me
My story start on the twenty-first of the winter
And it's cold, I've been baring my soul just like a pin-up
In the summer when it's hot we be rolling without the tint up
And I miss the good old days when good music came through antennas
When it's 10 up in the morning we wake up like “How we end up?”
But I'm glad we did handling biz, baby you in it
That's real love, it ain't been different since the beginning
We covered all bases and still we're going for innings
No need to make it complex baby, that’s what its meant for
That's word to my center, I shelter you like we indoor
Because I care about you
And anybody that’d want to hurt it I’d paralyze you

[Verse 2]
You're like that feeling of a father's first son born
Unconditional, I fell the speed of asteroid
In love, I send kisses and hugs to old misters
With all my goodbyes, finally completed my picture
The colors so descriptive
My heart resembled Christmas night
Gotta glow the window to my soul shows Christmas lights
Woke up to greatest gift; God read my list last night
I had a dream and what I seen was simpler than black and white
They don't like to take advice
You don't love when you see it so, look I have lapped you twice
Fruits of our labor are dying we need love in life
Call up your station, we need train all our people right
Cuz in the station they evaporatin' rapidly
Word to Oscar, give him Oscars for his great mastery
Depicting a story we know too well, I love you niggas
In the most special way and know that we always witchu

468,Silent Morning,"I'm on fire
My emotions run so deep
You vowed to love me
Is that a vow you keep

Your smile's so tender
You'll not be sighing a sweet surrender
Your touch is so pleasing
Makes me warm inside
Makes me feel I'm alive

And I can't resist the heavenly bliss
The magic concealed in your kiss
Must realize what I see in your eyes
Takes me beyond the skies

Silent morning, I wake up and you're not by my side
Silent morning, you know how hard I try
Silent morning, they say a man's not supposed to cry
Silent morning, why did your love have to be a lie

I'm on fire
And you're my every desire
A living fantasy
And you know just what to do for me

I love the things you do
Here open arms waiting here for you
Words you whisper
Makes me warm inside
Makes me feel I'm alive

And I can't resist the heavenly bliss
The magic concealed in your kiss
Must realize what I see in your eyes
Takes me beyond the skies

Silent morning, I wake up and you're not by my side
Silent morning, you know how hard I try
Silent morning, they say a man's not supposed to cry
Silent morning, why did your love have to be a lie

And I can't resist heavenly bliss
Magic concealed in your kiss
Must realize what I see in your eyes
Takes me to paradise

Silent morning, I wake up and you're not by my side

469,Brilliant Disguise,"[Verse]
I hold you in my arms
As the band plays
What are those words whispered, baby
Just as you turn away
I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind
To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found

[Chorus]
So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

[Verse 2]
I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard, baby
But I just can't see
What a woman like you
Is doing with me

[Chorus]
So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

[Bridge]
Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

[Verse 3]
Now you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand
We stood at the alter
The gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

[Chorus]
So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

472,It's A Sin,"[Verse 1: Cardinal Copia]

Forever with a sense of shame

For everything, I long to do

When your world is a prison and your trapped there alone
You wake up so empty, that the sheets feel like stone
I know you're gonna try and come to me like each time you're lonely
You know I'm going to turn my back on you 'cause this time it's over

Tell me who, who will you run to
When there's nowhere you can go
Just tell me who, who will you run to
When you call and I say no

Like each time you're crying and want to be free
You know I'm gonna give it all to you, you give nothing to me
I ain't gonna stand here while you make a fool of me
This time I won't be there and that's how it's going to be

Tell me who, who will you run to
When there's nowhere you can go
Just tell me who, who will you run to
When you call and I say no

You promised that this was the last time
But I've heard it all before
Just tell me who, who will you run to
And where will you go

You'll always keep running
'Cause it's the only thing you know
You'll always be back
'Cause it's the only place you can go

Tell me who, who will you run to
When there's nowhere you can go
Just tell me who, who will you run to
When you call and I say no

You promised that this was the last time

You met your match when you met me

But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy
