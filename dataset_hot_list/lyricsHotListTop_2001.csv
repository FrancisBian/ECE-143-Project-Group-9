0,How You Remind Me,"[Verse 1]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""Are we having fun yet?""

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you

[Pre-Chorus]
And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""Are we having fun yet?""

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no

[Bridge]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream ""Are we having fun yet?""

1,U Got It Bad,"[Intro]
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ouh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies say: ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...",Usher,2001,"[2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 6, 8, 16, 21, 32, 59, 87, 93]",15

4,Hero,"[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

Standing, by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day

5,"Whenever, Wherever","[Verse 1]
Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
Can't you see? I'm at your feet

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Verse 2]
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near

Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Outro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

10,A Woman's Worth,"[Verse 1]
You could buy me diamonds, you could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world (Baby, you know I'm worth it)
Dinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last (Baby, you know I'm worth it)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough, but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please her)

If you treat me fairly, I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should (Baby, I know you're worth it)
If you never play me, promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough ('Cause baby, I know you're worth it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She walks the mile, makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

Ohh, 'cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please me)

No need to read between the lines, spelled out for you (Spelled out for you)

I know that you'll thank God you did

I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do to be a better man
Cause if I was just to act a fool do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed my world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through when the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I must go do what I must do

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
A time, a space, a different place, how perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day you'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry you know I must do what I must do

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross

Well and it's not easy, Jah knows how I try I try
So don't you get weary (Oh God)
Jah knows how I try, I try

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
And God knows, that life is one big road
With a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the sites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
It's no valley low and it's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shining right through my heart
So my journey must start

Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross

Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet

Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

29,Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),"[Verse 1]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

[Verse 2]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell

To deny this bible's so absurd
I deny my pride, and God is first
So I got to dive inside His Word
What other way could we know how to live this thing?
It's inspired by the Spirit, man
So listen man, the very Word of God is in the scriptures, man

All races, all nations, Genesis to Revelation
So get up in it if you want to know
His will revealed through the Son and more

But bro you supposed to grow much closer

But in private they dive in, it be on they mind, they be thinking of it
We need that, read that, see that Jesus gets the glory He deserves
And the only way we can know His ways is if we stay up in His Word
He inspired it through writers they was carried along
The Spirit inspired the bible so all its merit is strong
Yes sir He breathed it Theopneustos
So if you trying to move close
Then get it, live it, give it to some faithful men that you know
Hope your passion is real passionate
Everybody in the faith got to master this
He ain't just write the Bible for the Pastor kid
So how we all gon' slack with it?
We got to get up in it heavy and be ready to live it out
This is for my Christians in it trying to figure scripture out

It may seem hard to understand at times
But depend on the Lord He handed down
Scriptures pointing to Himself don't just try to stack knowledge to cram in your mind
It ain't about knowledge you stack or all the doctrine you pack
Inside your mind man God's design was not just for you to find the facts
Don't be like them Pharisees, man they knew the scripture good
But from the looks of things apparently they ain't know all that they should
The Jews was searching the scriptures looking for life, the eternal kind
But for certain they was missing Christ John 5, 39
But don't get twisted man they intentions was great
But they was missing the faith, they had it twisted mistake
So get up in them right, they a witness of the Christ
Search it learn it then stick it in your life
Listen to the Christ's works and person
And perfect is a description of Him right?
Then pass it along to some faithful dudes
So cats will get strong and convey the truth
To others we love to discover truth and pass to our other brothers
Did I st-stutter? We got to follow Christ and His Father and the Spirit inside us guides us in the Word that's the model",116,2001,"[32, 31, 31, 35, 37, 39, 43, 52, 60, 60, 63, 73]",12
32,I Wanna Talk About Me,"[Intro]
Yeah yeah
That's right

[Verse 1]
We talk about your work, how your boss is a jerk
We talk about your church and your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you've been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother and your crazy ex-lover
We talk about your friends and the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the dimples on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes
You know talking about you makes me smile
But every once in awhile

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my, me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)

[Verse 2]
We talk about your dreams and we talk about your schemes
Your high school team and your moisturizer cream
We talk about your nanna up in Muncie, Indiana
We talk about your grandma down in Alabama
We talk about your guys of every shape and size
The ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
We talk about your heart, about your brains and your smarts
And your medical charts and when you start
You know talking about you makes me grin
But every now and then

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally
I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)

Now it's time to choose

[Chorus:]
Are you custom-made, custom-paid, or you just custom-fitted?
Playstation 2 up in the ride and is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin the hips, touchin lips to the top of the dick
Now tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place at a similar pace
So shake, shake it

On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

[Pre-Chorus]
Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, ""Love to rendezvous""
She asked me, ""What we were gonna do?""
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

Took her for a drink on Tuesday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I oh-oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a man to play around, baby (Oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that

Endless ringing off my phone
When you feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me

Boys in souped-up coupes

Feel broken down

How deep do you see when you spy into our lives?

I know that God lives in everybody's souls
And the only devil in your world
Lives in the human heart

So now ask yourself
What is human
And what is truth
Ask yourself
Whose voice is it that whispers unto you
From the cellars of your homes
From the tops of your city roofs
Ask yourself
Whose voice is it that whispers unto you

Who is it?
That turns your blood into spirit and your spirit into blood

Who is it?
That can reach down from above and set yours souls ablaze with love
Or fill you with the insanity of violence and it's brother lust

Who is it?
Whose words have been twisted beyond recognition
In order to build your planet Earth's religions

Who is it?
Who could make your little armies of the left
And your little armies of the right
Light up your skies tonight

Now some of you may live
And some of you may die
But remember
That nothing in your world can kill you inside
For he is thinking of you
In your great cities of great solitude

41,Drops Of Jupiter (Tell Me),"[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey

[Chorus 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus 2]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Breakdown]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?

[Chorus 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself?

42,Riding With Private Malone,"[Verse 1]
I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that said, ""old Chevy"" somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand

[Verse 2]
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green Army tarp
And when I pulled the cover off, it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty-six Corvette

[Verse 3]
I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
What a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteen sixty-six and this is what he wrote

[Chorus]
He said, ""My name is Private Andrew Malone
And if you're reading this, then I didn't make it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of mine, now it belongs to you
And though you may take her and make her your own
You'll always be riding with Private Malone""

[Verse 4]
Well, it didn't take me long at all, I had her running good
I loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shining like a diamond and I'd put the ragtop down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town

[Verse 5]
The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldie show, especially late at night
I'd get the feeling sometimes, if I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier ridin' shotgun in the seat right next to me

[Chorus]
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
He told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone

[Bridge]
Well, one night it was raining hard, I took the curve too fast
I still don't remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt

[Chorus]
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
And I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
Yeah, that night, I was riding with Private Malone
Oh, thank God, I was riding with Private Malone

I'm sorry that I can't get out of bed
I'm sorry that my head's always a mess
I'm sorry that I missed your call
For the third time in a row
I promise that I care much more than I show

[Verse]
Don't get carried away, no
I'll only let you down
Certain circumstances got me feeling low
Don't take it personally
Talk some sense into me, I’ve been feeling senseless
Acting selfish, hate myself so fucking much, I’m out of touch
But I can see through all the lies that they’ve been selling me
Quit telling me you know they know what's best for me
My patience being tested, see
In the parking lot of the high school that I went to
Thought I hated it, but it's real shit when your friends leave
And you're back home with the same dreams
On the same street
All of the things that I’ve taken for granted is now
Everything that I wish hadn’t ended
All that I hated is now what I miss
Ain't that a bitch

[Chorus]
I'm sorry that I can't get out of bed
I'm sorry that my head's always a mess
I'm sorry that I missed your call

Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me
You ain't seen bouncin' back

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gone respect me, appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much want to see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
Know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep ya chin up
And sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me
You ain't seen bouncin' back

No matter what happened, that's only once, it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then its shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble you didn't want learn
Sometimes we be getting so rude you ain't want see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take strides and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody say fool you better keep on rapping
Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happen
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life a be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

[Chorus 2x: Mystikal and Pharrell]
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me
You ain't seen bouncin' back

Oh you heard about it, yeah you had to
Hmm-huh, I know you change ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange huh
You was right in the middle complaining and forgot what you was cryin bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way its gotta be
And when its over and done with I hope you proud of me

And head straight to her house
We cuddle up on the couch
But it always ends the same ole way
I'm driving home and it's incredibly late
Something's got to change, because

I've been wrapped around her finger
Since the first time we went out

I need that girl beside me
When the lights go out
I think it's time to put a ring on the finger
I'm wrapped around

Went to the bank took out a loan
Went and bought the perfect stone
Called up her dad on the phone
I'm talking him to dinner Sunday night

I'll tell you why there's no love
Simply you're not cool enough

To the point we don't kiss no more

That night I met you on the disco floor
Every night since missed you more

Got to find me a new diva

Now you could never have a piece of my love
So when you see me don't reach for no hug
And don't speak in the club
Don't tell me how you deeply in love

That wanted to heat me with slugs
See the message on my beeper was bugged
Try to chill, lay deep in the cut

Even my girl think of beating you up
The way you keeping in touch
She don't know if niggas cheating or what

But you couldn't handle it

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me ""cabron"" plus ""maricon""
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo""
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap
She like: ""Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me""
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
""Ma cherie amour, tu es belle""
Merci, you're fine as fuck but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather
She said: ""all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken.. damn I'm getting fat

I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, why you don't buy me Reeboks no more
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time!
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat

Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl.. wanna leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like, ""Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass

Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
Cause I can guarantee that I'll be fine

Why'd I play the fool?
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
'Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

Now you're free from all the pain (free from all the pain)
Free from all the game (free from all the pain)
Free from all the stress (free from all the stress)

It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or loose
And I choose to win

Flacko, I wonder how it feel to live or be like you
Album number three and keep it G like Q
Heard you niggas get fly like G, like 2
Nah, more like 4, like 3, not 2
Shittin' on these niggas like P, like U
Drip Raheem and Q, got Hi-C like juice
Mama hubby got life, he got three strikes too
Real niggas bleed like me, like you
That's why I got a beam with a green light too
I don't even make a scene, I just swing right through
I'm just stayin' on my Qs and my Ps like soup
Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha-brotha, gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', brotha understand, God don't make the plays
Take the truth, get through, ride your wave, just keep the truth

Remember when I went to my brotha, told him, ""Help me please""

My fantasy's to have sex wit two broads
On a boat or a plane, some exotic cars
From a Bentley to a Lex, girl, bring the toys
On the dance floor, shawty started takin it off
Took her to the V.I.P., started breakin me off
Said she knew I was a baller by my iced out wrists
I told her ""Wait, it don't stop, keep drinkin the Cris'""
I'm a country boy just like the Dukes of Hazzard
See a fine chick, you know I'm gon' grab her

And I need to do what I feel like doing
So, let me go, and just listen

[Verse 1]
All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying, ""Little girl, don’t step into the club""
Well, I’m just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing’s what I love, yeah

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical? What's logical?
What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it

Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
Bitch, you're a black hole, sucking me in your vacuum
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future, then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?
(Why you acting like a peasant?)
I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes
Goodbye, bye
(Fucked it all up! Stupid!)
Goodbye!

[Verse 2]
Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!
(That's just one bum you should've told)
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you

65,The Long Goodbye,"Well, the end days rise
Yet the world gets by
While they fill my skies with junk
Still celestial bodies spinning out the sun
Are bringing your deliverance as one

Hail the wounded stars hiding ageless arks
Come and take my body so far, so far
Cause home may be calling
Or home some other lark
But as a noonday witness, I'm lost!

Pull the sticky pine
Build some other mind
Cause faith ain't enough, ain't enough
For as God's my pilot I need Him to make the charts
To route my escape from this heart

Well, the end days rise
Yet the world gets by
While they fill my skies with goodbyes
Still celestial bodies spinning out the sun

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2]
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

And after the original you know what it is
Welcome to Atlanta

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
Remix, it had to go down
I got somethin' else to tell you 'bout the new Motown
Where people don't visit, they move out here
And ain't no tellin' who you might see up in Lenox Square
I don't know about you but I miss the Freaknik
'Cause that's where my city use to be real sick
People from other cities used to drive for miles
Just to come to get a taste of this ATL style
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballinest Player
Make my own moves, call me the mayor
Monday night, you know things change with time
Magic City back lookin' like '89
All the homies on the Southside up in the Ritz
Tuesday night, the Velvet Room, same shit
Wednesday, Strokers, I don't go no mo'
'Cause they don't know how to treat you when you come through the do'
Thursday night, was Plush but we moved to Fuel
And I be up in the booth drunk, actin' a fool
Friday night, at Kaya, they still got love
And the Sharkbar be poppin' like it's a nightclub

Tell Flex to run it back and drop a bomb on it

Monday, we go to Bungalow 8
Tuesday, I'm in Spa, drunk, doin' the shake
And for the rest of the week, we just follow the freaks
You can spot us out of town by the way that we walk
The way that we talk, cocky, the state of New York
Hot now top down at the Rucker game
New coupe, no roof, playa, what's my name?
Now Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten
Uptown, what now?! Let's make it happen

New York, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere

Who say St. Louis ain't hip hop? Dirty, we hop to what's hip

I was like ""The Waterboy,"" now they sayin, ""YOU CAN DO IT!""
I'm Baby Huey, one of the best in the Louie
Sip Louis, smoke louie, dressed in Louis
Home of back porches, Chucks, and Air Forces
Old school cars be trailblazin' like Portland
The girls are the best like Travis with fat asses
I call 'em gimme girls, they always tell me I can have it
All got habits, marijuana to static
By two cats and coats with automatics

Palm trees, bad bitches and wannabees

Now & Laters, jellybeans, and Wallabees
Real niggas from the set I hardly ever seen
Mostly heard, sell a bird off the cizzurb
And when we dip, we hop and then we swizzerve
A lot of homies like to wear the pizzerm
Hair longer than hers, sharp with the fizzur

Take that, take that
Long Beach is on the motherfuckin map

Go to Pomona, scoop up Kokane
Head to the church house to get a little workout
Smoke out, drink up, now put ya bank up

Crank up the beat, raise up the heat
I'm throwin' a block party on 2-1 Street, fo' sho'

What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'

I'm just staring at you through this tint
I tell you exactly what you need if you just listen
I'm just rollin' up, I split the weed just like division
I don't really know this bitch I met her through my mentions
Heard I fucked her cousin good and paid her no attention
Not to mention I'm on Insta, diamonds trippin' I'm just chillin'

I got visions of testing her limits, imagine her sight

Verbal couture
Parkour
With the metaphors
The flow house of horror
Dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch
Six sense
With a nose drip
Mind skydive
Sniffing bumps
In the cockpit
Locksmith of Hip Hop
Appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size
As the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic
Prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends
Cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke
Just to sniff need a ski lift
Flip your table over
If you cut it with the bullshit
Nose bleeds red carpets
But it just blend in
Snapping pictures
Feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life
Seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left
So I try to seize the moment

Octopus in a straight jacket
Savage with bad habits
Broke serving fiends
Got rich became a addict

Nose running right now
Could ya pass me a napkin
Managed to somehow
To have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone
And nobody is answering

Say ya need to slow down
Cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face

Staring in the devil face
But ya can't stop laughing

That most of us might share
Inherited in our blood
It's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use
Or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to
Tell you what I’m gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems
With this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me
So popping them Xannies
Might need rehab
But to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y’all

Bought a 8 ball of coke
And my nigga on the way
Got 3 hoes with him

And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

I talk to God every day, and he made me a promise
Me and T like Malcolm and Elijah Muhammad
Me and Swizz like Martin and Jesse
But the fact that I can get assassinated, is starting to stress me
I ain't tryna let the police department arrest me
But I still keep steel tucked under the fresh tee
And I ain't just rapping for my health
So before you diss me, you be betta off clappin' at yourself
Cause I ain't tryna battle on the mic
I have them goons hop out on you like they did Harold at the light

82,Where I Come From,"Songtekst van Zack Ink - Where I Come From (ft. 3robi & LouiVos)

[Hook: Zack Ink]
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns

[Verse 1: Zack Ink]
Snel geld, fast life
Breng je spullen naar mij, ik kan het snel kwijt
Ik kan straight met je praten als je cash draait
Broer ik zit er net in maar ik cash uit
Ze komt net van mij, ze zit nu met hem thuis
Ze snapt me en ze zegt me hij heeft geld thuis
Zulke dingen zie je vaak in mijn stad
De block is heet en ze zetten m'n wijk af
Er is handel sowieso als je in m'n stad komt
Je gaat vallen je valt op, vertrekt met een tas vol
M'n kleine pirie is boos, hij loopt met een handgun
Zerodix fuck 'm all, they know where I come from

[Hook: Zack Ink]
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns

En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns

[Verse 2: LouiVos]
Herres, herres, where I come from
Ben begonnen op de- uitkijk man
Sbe3, sbe3, kijk uit man
Ben met burgemeester, echt een stackman
Meer papier hier, dan de paagman
Jij stijlt ook, ewa dress dan
Ik en drerrie doen je denken aan de yesman
Als ik langsloop, zegt ze yes man
Low-key netjes, smooth criminel
Playboy, pluk je kip, crime passionel
Keuken, whip whip, professionnel
Pak zwart en wit net Chocomel
White guys, ik ren net running man
Mijn guys, ik gun, net Unicef
Zack Ink, WW, straight hooligan
Veel vuur, brandbaar net drukke tent

[Hook: Zack Ink]
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns

En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns

[Verse 3: 3robi]
Ben met Vos, ik boss, ik ram man
3 keer X motherfack Amsterdam man
Gekke moetroes voor de police
Gekke gannoes zijn verdeeld over m'n homies
Ik voel me wijzer met die ijzer
Streng, boos, net een keizer
Ik heb die gannoe voor die motherfacker
Ik ben met spua, jij met alles pakkers

84,Part II,"[Intro: Beyoncé]
Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
An innocent love I'm misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Toast to clichés in a dark past

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces, chugging D'USSÉ, ugh
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long I'm next to you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
Why

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but

[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tats, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Ugh
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'ma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack
Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl
'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming

[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Deeper than words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo

I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away

[Intro: Big Sean]
Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right

86,Angry All The Time,"[Verse 1]
Here we are, of what is left of a husband and a wife
With four good kids, who have a way, of getting on with their lives
And I'm not old, but I am getting a whole lot older every day
It's too late to keep from going crazy, I've got to get away

[Chorus]
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels like this worlds' left you far behind
I don't know why you got to be angry all the time

[Verse 2]
Our boys are strong now
The spitting image of you when you were young
I hope someday they can see past, what you have become
I remember, every time I said I'd never leave
But what I can't live with is memories of the way you used to be

[Chorus]
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one who feels like this worlds' left you far behind
I don't know why you got to be angry all the time

[Verse 3]
Twenty years, have came and went since I walked out of your door
I never quite made it back to the one I was before
And God it hurts me to think of you
For the light in your eyes was gone
Sometimes I don't know why this old world can't leave well enough alone

[Chorus]
The reasons that I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being in love
I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this rough

88,The Star Spangled Banner,"[Verse]
Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream
'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more
Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""
And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave",Whitney Houston,2001,"[89, 82, 90, 85, 85, 80, 59, 38, 18, 6, 13, 72, 97, 50]",14

Sex on the beach, check the size of my meat; call me the butcher
Ludacris King Ding-a-Ling sheet smusher
Sweet street pusher, give me that gusher
Nasty stuff - look up - I took her
Ran out of liquor (time to re-up!)
Here comes her nigga (who gives a fuck!)
Rap fame and plat' thangs they can't hang
I mack dames and pack thangs and act strange
Jang-a-ling dang-a-ling oh no they can't stop
Take it to the floor back up and then drop
Effervescent.. time time's of the essence
Make 'em undress in less than three seconds
So whores keep steppin whores keep slobbin
Sex as a weapon, clothes that I slept in
Streets keep mobbin, thieves keep robbin
Get two in yoor butt, three to your noggin
Creepin and crawlin, I'm incogneg'
Can't catch the balls then you in the wrong league
Let a dog breathe, watch a pimp walk
Shut yo' ass up when you hear a pimp talk
Friskier dreams, Krispier Kremes
You lookin mighty fine in them jeans

[Hook]
All you brothers want a, fatty girl, fatty girl
Fatty girl - who me?
You know I got a, fatty girl, fatty girl
Fatty girl - what's she mean?

Hair like Brillo, cuttin up my pillow
Got 'em sayin (hello!) naked in a tub of a Jello
Still no competition, still flow nigga listen

Aiyyo welcome home Murray!

Yo, this is in thought of those broads who got the goods

You'll soon get it, just stay workin hard at it
Goodness gracious, good God almighty
You got a badonkadonk, girl don't hurt nobody!
Toes all painted, feet all out
It's an aphrodisiac for the mall without a doubt
Juicy chunky stanky funky
Gut slappin ball slappin cater to your every fantasy
You got your tongue clitoris tits and belly pierced (all that?)
Necklace around yo' waist toe rings - girl do yo' thang!
I mean, in them jeans yo shape is BEAUTIFUL!
And I'm ""For You, By You"" like FUBU (bitch you know the name)
Whoo-wee Jesus JoJo K-Ci and Mary
Girl you don't know what you do to me (lord have mercy!)
Ain't no doubt about it, when she walk by
Tongues hang out, eyes pop out the socket (BING!)
Cats cringe and point like pssh
Ummph you can see that thang from the front
We gas those up like, full service
And, keep 'em drunk like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when you shake it, you rock my world
I done died and went to heaven, you got a fatty girl!

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)

You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 1]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody!

I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)

And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

I was born 3 months too early
The doctor gave me 30 days
But I must have had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on living
Even if this love's to die for
Because your bags are packed and I ain't crying
You're walking out and I'm not trying to change your mind
Because I was born to be

[Chorus]
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
Though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I want to be

[Chorus]
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

[Verse 3]
Oh, a single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stop
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter

From when I met you at the roller rink
Cotton candy with her Shasta drink
Braced with caress that were white and pink

Knew you'd be mine some how, some day
And I'ma say I do

Get your bubble on, bring your girlfriends
All y'all can come along

In the Cadillac beatin' up some Battlecat
Dogg youse a fool baby lemme handle that
Oh you don't drink so you don't think
You ain't gon' win you don't speak, you ain't no freak

Twenty inch thangs in the coupe with Snoop
Gettin juiced orange juice top down
And feel the sun rays feelin kinda good right know
Right around my hood right now
Lookin for somethin to do like a barbecue
It's too hot to be in the house

A little bit of drank and a game of spades
Take your kids to your mama's house
Sure know what I'm talkin bout, it's about to go down!

Wish God, I didn't have 'em, but I'm glad that he made 'em
(uhh!) The roaches, the rats, the strays, the cats (what, what?!)
The guns, knives and bats, everytime we scrap
The hustlin', the dealin', the robbin', the stealin' (uhh!)
The shit, hit the ceiling', little boy, with no feelings
(damn) The frustration, rage, trapped inside a cage
Got beatin's 'til the age, I carried a twelve gauge
(aight!) Somebody stop me (please!), somebody come and get me
(what?!) Little did I know, that the Lord was ridin' with me
The dark, the light (uhh), my heart (uhh), the fight (uhh)
The wrong (uhh!), the right (uhh!), it's gone (uhh!), aight?

100,Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!),"[Verse 1]
While he was scheming
I was beamin' in the Beamer just steamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on my way I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cashbox rang, I thought everything away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops) There goes ""You'll never leave me alone""
(Oops) For all the lies you told
This is what you're owed

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

[Verse 2]
While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just faded away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now

(Oops) There goes ""you'll never leave me alone""
(Oops) For all the lies you told
This is what you owe

Hey ladies (Hey ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times

So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies (Ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild (Oh)

Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes

So you better let 'em know that
If you mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

[Bridge]
All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is just better than money, you'll see

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time

You and me takin' flicks

Every other, every other time

I said let's talk about it
As she walked out on me and slammed the door
But I just laugh about it
'Cause she's always playin' those games, come on

Deep down I know she loves me
But she's got a funny way of showin' me how she cares
Last night she did a doughnut on my lawn
And drove out with one finger in the air, oh yeah

Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time
Yeah, every other time

Sometimes we sit around
Just the two of us, on the park bench
Sometimes we swim around
Like the dolphins in the ocean of our hearts

But then I think about the time
When we broke up before the prom
And you told everyone that I was gay
Okay

Sometimes I walk around the town
For hours just to settle down
But I take you back and you kick me down
'Cause that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it

Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she'll just change her mind

Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time

Keep it up home girl, don't you quit
You know the way you scream is the ultimate
And when I walk away, just watch the clock
I bet I don't even get around the block

One day we'll laugh about it

Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out

I refused to get a job, so I got the boot
With a brown back pack on the town, everything that i owned
In a box or two in the back of my cousins Honda
Hit the 5 to get up to the bay
17 with no clutch
No brakes no damn ideas on what it would take to make music to live
Not much debate, that's what it would be, no plan b
No can see no other path, no other math added up
Anyone disagree, missing me subtract that energy
Easily I approach, microphones like I needed one in hand to look natural
Scared little man didn't know what to do
When he got on the stage, he was hiding from you
How could that be? One asked
One outcast couldn't look his best friends in the eye
Wanna die when nervousness enters the brain like parasites
Paralyzed by bright lights, loud eyes, and licence to kill self with night vices
The nice guys finish first sometimes
When a man puts in work on his timeline
When a man rides the surf in his mind
Through catching waves of consciousness divine through rhyme
Over melody's
Piano takes me back to a simple me

[Hook: Eligh]

So complicated, so complicated, so complicated..

[Verse 2: The Grouch]

Now 87 is one of my tempos
You could throw me a curve though
I ain't no simp bro
Been riding the beat since my talent was local
Bay bred buddy 'til I switched it to SoCal
Big Grizzly from the peak to the paws
Used to do that to the tape and wouldn't get no applause
Now every once in a while
Folks from my past put it together and they shit in they draws
Not literally though, figuratively
No Mr. forgive me no more, never know door mat
Wipe your feet on your own back
Ain't into the burnin' bridges, I could never condone that
Till I collapse, I'm still ill and dealin' dap's
Feeling myself, self, you feeling that?
But of course, I love your voice, your word choice is choice
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
No, but got a German get up and go
So tell me when ta hip ya
You already know
This deep in the scripted sleek
Well dipped, rhythmic, poetic deliverance of speech
With a universal reach
We keep it versatile, to each it's personal
Held close to the blood pump till nurses come
Which song you going to play when the hearses bump?

In our old sleepin' bags
By a make believe fire
In our tent made of covers
We'd talk for hours
My two brothers and me
Keepin' the faith
Racin' with destiny

Chorus

They were angels in waiting
Waiting for wings to fly from this world
Away from their pain
Treasuring time
'Til time came to leave
Leave them behind
Sweet memories
Angels in waiting
Angels in waiting for wings

2nd Verse

They always knew
They'd never grow old
Sometimes the body is weaker than the soul
In their darkest hour
I made a promise
I will always keep
I'll give them life
I'll let them live through me

Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one? Pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me (Huh)

[Verse 2: Eve]
Now why you gritting your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

I got something to say, something to say
Alright (Can you feel me?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

[Verse 1]
I was checking this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)

[Verse 2]
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out went the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)""

[Bridge]
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
Watchin' our every move
Think some day they might approve, baby

""Ladies and gentlemen
Let's put our hands together for this dynasty!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the 8th wonder of the world!
The flow of the century, always timeless: HOV!
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me, I appreciate that, ah""

[Verse 1]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! —Vamoose, son of a bitch!

H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks

[Chorus]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA

H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy

NYC what the fuck is goin' on?
These mothafuckas won't play my song

They sayin' that these other fuckers better than us, you gotta be kiddin'
A bunch of pussies, when you piss, you gotta be sittin'
You tie your hair in a bun and shirt in a knot
You got the urge to suck the cock of Serge Ibaka
Pictures of naked rappers hangin' in your locker
You and your father never played catch, he taught you how to twerk
Since I've been on the Earth I've been lightin' up
And I've been all around the world twistin' dykes and purp
Shit, light the earth

Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while

She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two

See her face whenever I, I look at you

It goes, mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the biggest baller of all
I got a 700, a Bentley, and a Magine
The girls just DIE when I'm ridin past
Live life like I'm sellin pies
Ah-rabian, with two or three wives
Two or three houses to hide
Ten cars that's parked outside
And they all got bodies that's wide, follow me
As the Leer jet flies, over Crimson Tides
Four bedroom duplex in the sky
Nicknamed Lottery, cuz I don't stop spendin
When the wheels stop, the chrome keep spinnin
Like the six moon-walkin, shit I ain't talkin

To roll with me and Nate D-O double G, sing

You know I give you number one hits platinum hot
It's so much clarity in my rocks, I'm thinkin like
It's gotta be somebody greater, maybe it's not
Cuz I flow for those, that get that dough
Hits for every chick with a size C tits
See it's like this, I don't mind wavin at you kids
But I can't manage to raise my wrist
Jewels so heavy, y'all fools ain't ready
My twenty-two shot the streets into confetti
Move like Andretti, redlinin
Whatever city I'm in, headlinin
At five a.m. I'm still lookin for mo'
Still gettin crunk, still lettin it flow
Bar outta Cris' now I'm drinkin Mo'
Stomach upset, I feel like I'm about to let it go

Take a young queen just to know one
So, baby, I’ma drive it like it’s stolen
I’ma fix it like it’s broken

Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But they’re too busy making assumptions

Turn your block club to my fan club
And that happen so fast
Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finish, if she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back for the dub, rematch
Flip the crib when we fuck, RE/MAX
It get hot than a mug, glass cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no deposit
But I don’t gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl

No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her she don't hit me back something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her has she seen my baby
Roll my six around looking for that missing lady
Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down
Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound
Somethings going on upstairs
And I know nobody else lives here
""bump bump bump"" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear
Then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screaming out....

You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you got
(and then a man said)
Sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(And I just can't believe this shit)

I ran downstairs looked in the closet looking for that ooo
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a Preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplating ""not in my own damn house""
Who would have thought she was creeping with another man?

And then I turned the TV down

Cause I know no one else lives here

Still at odds with the Irish mob
Rolls Royce down Malcom X boulevard

Got the .40 on me, and it's staying on me

Run the books and let me show you how the numbers look

The kilos come in like they new pianos
Fat boy got the big body

They wanna see you up in Alcatraz

You either snitching or lying about the shit you done
You ain't never move a brick 'less you was building a house

134,Schism,"I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers

Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?

I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)

Through Russel, not his muscles

That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor

It's been a while since I spoke to you, everything seems different now
I'm tryna focus, you've been out of frame, but it's crazy how I see the picture now
It's been a while since you've been around, me, I finally put the liquor down
Crazy how life is bittersweet, 'cause my grandpa is gettin' sicker now
Yeah, I've been tryin' not to lose touch, but all this stress is just too much
When I was young, it was me and him ridin' 'round the city just the two of us
Wish I spent more time with him, all the times that I held back
All this money in my bank account, but there ain't a way to buy health back
See, back then we was close, then I lost who I was
Gettin' close to my dreams, but further from who I love
What's meant to be is just meant to be, I don't think we could change that
I ain't sayin' I regret it now, I just wish I had them days back

Yeah
It's been a while since I spoke to you, both of us gettin' older now
Life is movin' so fast for me, I just wish I had a way to slow it down
Wish I wasn't scared to open up, 'cause I ain't talked to my dad still
But he's stubborn though, that's where I get it from, he drinks Hennessy with his Advil
Everyone say I'm just like him; we smile hard and we hide tears
Even though I've seen him last month, I ain't seen my dad in like five years
And that gets to me, heart's heavy, I just can't adjust to these changes
Lost some people that was closest to me, now I'm losin' all of my patience
Ex girls say they still love me, old friends just come and go
Really I've been tryna move on, but I'm too afraid to end up alone
Too afraid to give my love, 'cause I'm too afraid I won't feel love
And I'm too afraid that I'll find love just to find out it's not real love
I got so many trust issues, wish I was there to uplift you
And even though we ain't close now, it's difficult to not miss you
But I wonder what you say to people when they speak about me
I know we both went our separate ways, I just wonder if you still think about me

Redneck dot com on the internet
I don't need it if I can't find it in my head
Just give me my pickup and a dip of skoal
A blanket, my baby and a fishing hole
And head on after where life begins
Down where the black top ends

Look in the rear view, smile away flying by
Watch it all disappear as the dust flies
Rip it off and never look back again

I can't think of any place I'd rather be
Middle of nowhere with her beside me
Snuggle up by the fire on the river bed
Down where the black top ends

We've been pounding the pavement
And saving up enough for a down payment
On a little house in the woods startin' over again
Down where the black top ends

Now some say we're out of our minds
Well, I'd say that they're right and that is why we
Don't need a telephone, fax or a time clock
We just paint our last name on the mailbox
If you need us feel free to just drop on in

When you need to get a way, you're welcome anytime
Leave your hustle and your bustle on the other side
Get back at the world ride holiday inn
Down where the black top ends

We've been pounding the pavement
And saving up enough for a down payment

150,What I Really Meant To Say,"(Cyndi Thomson/Chris Waters/Tommy Lee James)

It took me by surprise
When I saw you standin' there
Close enough to touch
Breathin' the same air
You asked me how I'd been
I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine
Oh, but baby I was lyin'

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held on to my pride and watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm really not that strong
No matter how I try
I'm still holdin' on
And here's the honest truth
I'm still in love with you
And, that's what I really meant to say

That's what I really meant to say
That's what I really meant to say",Cyndi Thomson,2001,"[41, 33, 32, 26, 31, 36, 38, 39, 38, 47, 54, 54, 58, 64, 74, 74, 89, 94, 96, 98]",20
151,Bad Boy For Life,"[Intro: P. Diddy]
Ayo, you ready?
Let's do it

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
I'm the definition of ""half man, half drugs""
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wussup
After bucks, crush crews after us
No games, we ain't laughing much
Nothing but big things, check the hit list
How we twist shit, what changed but the name?
We still here, you rockin' with the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks (Ha!)
Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think cause I'm iced out, I'mma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me
Get it right, dawg, we ain't ever left
We just moved in silence and repped to the death
It's official, I survive what I been through
Y'all got trauma, the saga continues

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Verse 2: Black Rob]
Hey yo straight from the Harlem streets
I don't play, I push it down with the Harlem Heat
All a sudden niggas got a problem wit me
They run around actin like the Black-o can't eat
And you know what? For some strange reason
I'm off of this medication, feeling deranged needing
For y'all to put the word out, we ain't leavin'
We trying to be rich before we all stop breathing
Therefore we kinda hustle lames
Stay laying down our muscle games
Still turn niggas dreams to flames, you got the wire
If not I ain't sayin no names; you'll soon expire
No pain, nothing, I feel remorse
Yes of course it's me and Diddy up first racing Porsches
With the big twin valve exhausts
On the cover of your Vibes, XXLs, and Sources, bitch

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Verse 3: Mark Curry]
It ain't shit changed, since the Notorious (we miss you Big)
See everything still glorious
We still got warriors, still be the victorious
See it's a lot of them, but it's more of us
Still got cash to blow, raps to flow
Still them cats that know, pack yo' flow
That's fo' sho', bottles that pop, joints that rock
Played the background, hand on my jock, holdin' my Glock
Money to get, cars to flip
Bars to sit at and sip Cognac wit jewels that drip
Hoes to see, make sure they knowin' it's me
Drop that beat, can't believe that I MC
Bad boy 'til the casket drop, gotta love it
Place nothing above it, it's on like that
Don't believe, we ain't gone like that
We're always gonna be here
We there every motherfucking year!

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

152,Music,"[Part 1: Pound Cake, Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Chorus: Timbaland]

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said ""Hov, it ain't many of us""
I told 'em ""Less is more, nigga, is plenty of us""

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg",Drake,2001,"[93, 92, 89, 83, 82, 68, 50, 46, 40, 31, 28, 25, 24, 22, 23, 23, 23, 34, 44, 60, 44, 29, 27]",23

I get uncomfortable, hide behind my walls
And I talk in circles, but at least I say what I mean
And I rock my heart on the sleeve of my T-shirt

I'll die with all of me, all of me
And if I give back the time that I've borrowed

That's nothing new, yeah
And I don't really like to get dressed up
What's it to you? I know what I can do
And I'm not Bowie, Prince or Queen
But at least I do what I dream
And I rock my soul on both sleeves of my T-shirt

[Chorus]
So if I should die tomorrow
I'll die with all of me, all of me
And if I give back the time that I've borrowed
I'll know I gave everything, everything

Forget, forget me, no
No, you won't, no, you won't

Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hidin'?

Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!""
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical

Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Uhh, shit
Please don't throw up, hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas, we gon' show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars it's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball so what's cracking with y'all?

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Native New Yorker, the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter, stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily, God I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

[Hook: Alicia Myers & Kanye West]
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Yeah, it feel good, don't it? Uhh
For shining Your light on me
It feel good, don't it? Uhh
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Ay, I want to let y'all know
Ay, ay, I want to let y'all know, this Yeezy
For shining Your light on me
And you listening to Q-Tip

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making it though
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done, rip up your paper 'cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
You're just a single cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff?
Beat him in the head, boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, ""Stop killing me, wolf""
Whop, beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
Oxy in me pulse, he don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit we sinners, when me and Abstract together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners, pillar of this rap shit, homie they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music, iTune it, YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas, drink Alizé liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us and her man's attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus, we're prone to handle
We're gentlemen

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
Not to mention, we're veterans, second, he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless, it's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it, I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left

Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers tryin to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die

Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I been through more shit that you can't even relate to

They dodgin the Fedz, and suckas is playa hatin
They got the whole hood stacked up
And now the po's walkin on the showroom floor buyin 'Lac Trucks
They stuck in the ghetto by choice
But if they go, it's jacuzzis and condos, with a Rolls Royce
Now voice your opinion
You heard about the 'War On Drugs'
Now won't you tell me who you think winnin
Spendin money by the piles throwin dubs
On the 'burbans with the subs
And they twerkin bumpin Coo Coo Cal
And the hood love hoodrats
On the bus-stop shakin it like it's hot with some good cat

Dawg, go on and sum it up between the grind with dimes
Crimes and rhymes, ya'll we comin up

The block watch, peekin out the attic in case you run up
Wit diamonds and furs, he's and her's
Shoppin sprees with ease to fill up a 2000 Suburb, ha
Dawg my projects got taste
Although the rent ain't nuthin but two-fifty
We sportin five thousand dollar drapes
Makin it happen, wit snappin to avoid that - anchor
Hook me up with plenty tracks to keep a playa rappin
So put my city on the map
Hook me up wit million dollar vocal cords
I can afford a million on a track
You do the addin and subtractin
Wastin time just to figure out, without a doubt, that we stackin

167,What It Is,"[Verse 1]
Pretty soon you have to deal
With the truth behind the way you feel
And I'd rather never know
I would do anything, anything
Not to bring who I am to meet me
This useless suffering
Ugly part of me is screwing me
As it feeds me

[Chorus]
But it is what it is
You don't know how to live with what it is
But it is what it is
It may seem impossible
But I will embrace who I really am
If it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid
Then that's what it is

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon you'll have to face
You're a virus called the human race
And I’d rather never know
I have done everything, everything
Not to feel what it is I'm feeling
This basement devil is kicking the ass
Of my angel on the ceiling

[Chorus]
But it is what it is
You don't know how to live with what it is
But it is what it is
It may seem impossible
But I will embrace who I really am
If it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid
Then that's what it is

[Bridge]
Don't push me, don't kill me
What it is 'cause it is what it is
Don't play games, don't mess with
What it is 'cause it is what it is
Don't ask me, don't tell me
What it is 'cause it is what it is
Don't push me, don't kill me
What it is 'cause it is what it is
Don't run from where you come from
'Cause it is what it is
And I, I

[Chorus]
But it is what it is

Everything you do is everything I know

But little does anyone know, yeah
I've been working, I ain't perfect
I don't need you to tell me ""it's yours""
You know what it is I adore
And something about it that inspires me to hit it more
You told me you coming, well shit I'll just buzz you in
Keys are still under the mat by the door
Ignore the mess
My crib ain't the cleanest from company I had the evening before, yeah

I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

He's all mine
And his lovin' makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride

I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be
My loverboy

Loverboy c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me

I toss and turn in my bed

172,Laredo,"As I walked out on the streets of Laredo
As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
""I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
""Come and sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die""

""It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle, I used to go gay
First to the card-house and then down to Rose's
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall""

""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong""

""Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother
And tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone
But please not one word of the man who had killed me
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on""
When this he had spoken, the hot sun was setting
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley
And there stands his marker we made to this day

We beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as we carried him along
Down in the green valley, lay the sod over him
He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong",Johnny Cash,2001,"[96, 93, 84, 63, 60, 62, 64, 77, 71, 74, 78, 83]",12

175,I'm Already There,"[Verse 1]
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

Don't make a sound

While you loved me

As a morning sun, on a new day
Even though I know the end
Well, I'd do it all again

Your love affair has got to go, for ten long years
For ten long years, the leaves to rake up

Blue clouded gray, you're not a crack up
Dizzy and weakened by the haze

Now fuck the silencer, I'm shooting through the pillow
And if the door locked I'm jumping through the window
I might be wrong but I ain't tryna work a 9 to 5
So if I gotta sell these pills, I'mma sell them high
Go get your business straight or renovate a condo
Ratchet bitches whipping chicken like a roscoes
Niggas face tatted like ?? and Bosco
In my city niggas judging for what you got on
I’m well known from Atlanta past Figg doe
Me teecee4800 mustard getting rich, though
Lemmie Lams 'getting money like what they hidden for
Follow code, gotta value morals and principle
Niggas acting like they pimps but they pay the bitch
Some of us ain't in a position that we say we in
In one year I had to move in three residence
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Mercedes Benz

[Hook]
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride low key
I don't want a dime on me
Snitches throw they time to me
That's why I always ride low key
I gotta keep the fire on me

[Verse 2]
You making shit more complicated than it should be
Industry makers be clicking up over hood beef
Record me fucking your bitch and let my hood see
Cause I be banging the hood when I'm in the pussy
Oh, motherfucking bitch, bring my shit back
Fucking on a flip with a clover-leaf tat
Running off the lip, I'm off the hip like rrra
Hold up, rrra, rrra, rrra, rrra, rrrra
And all these new niggas tryna join the team now
Cherry picking, bitch nigga get a rebound
No chameleon but I'm going through some changes
Cause those that I help get famous went senile
AK 47, 7 trays, lot of clips like I'm tryna make the VMAs
RJ do my dirt on the low cause what they don't know don't show my momma these

181,Ghetto Girls,"[Verse 1]
Uh, like when Janet was Justice, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
A shorty that can tell you when the J's come out
Get creative with they haircuts like T-boz
Fav'rite rappers is Bow Wow, Snoop, JD, & Nas
Always up in they somebody's face tryin' to fuss
And to get where she goin', she can take the bus
Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame
Or the type you can find sitting at a Ruckers game
Only like dealing with cats that love to floss
Only like rocking the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinnis' tattoos on her back
Attitude like Mary J., mixed with Brat
You can find a man at a beauty shop, mall, or church
Name brand head to toe with the matching purse
So all that siddity stuff, y'all can keep
'Cause only girls that keep it ghetto get to ride with me (fo' sho)

[Chorus]
Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?

[Verse 2]
When they ride with they man like you won't believe
Switch the color on there hair like Eve
When they talk like I talk but walk like a lady
Snap like I snap and get a little crazy
I love that especially when they bout the cheese
Type that won't front for some Mickey D's
Bandanas to barrets daisy dukes to spandex all thats good with me
I like em' G-H-E-T-T-O, now believe me she gots to go
At the corner store buying up all the sweets
From Choo Choo's to Rice Krispy Treats on my street
That's all I see like everyday
And they do what they do in a crazy way
Hang with the ballers so they never pay
And they usually got a name that's hard to say (ya heard)

[Chorus]
Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?

Always hit them weak motherfuckers right in they mouth
You better stay out the way and act like you ain't havin' shit
Cause niggas will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you
You'd be a damn fool to act like you ballin' dude
Mindin' yo business, they grabbed you by yo collar
You feel like Marvin Gaye cause they make you wanna holler
But since you can't run, you might as well fight

Every time we were together
We'd talked about forever
I was certain
It was heaven we had found

But you can't live your life
Walking in the clouds
Sooner or later
You have to come down

[Verse 3:]
It's like a knife
Through the heart
When it all comes apart
It's like someone takes a pin to your balloon

It's a hole
It's a cave
It's kind of like a grave
When he tells you that he's found somebody new

190,She Couldn't Change Me,"Sometime I think what turned her on
Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through

But not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
And poured out my best brew

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
While she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She changed direction headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same

She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed all right

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

She changed direction headed back home
She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones
She had her dark brown hair pulled back
And blue eyes like you've never seen
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

And maybe if I stayed out a little longer
Maybe if I drank that bottle of wine
Maybe if I did the drugs that they did maybe things would be fine

I can't, I won't, I don't relate to you

193,Two People Fell In Love,"[Verse 1]
A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
Before you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates
They've driven or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

[Chorus]
There is nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love

[Verse 2]
Well, I recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lot to help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

[Chorus]

You know, to me it's all so clear
Every one of us is here

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be

[Chorus]
Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be

[Verse 2]
There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be

But he didn't check his phone today
Oh, there's my summer girl
I've been wanting her
But I hear she's got a boyfriend
Thought I could leave her for a season
But it just got cold
And it's a lonely hour in my cell phone tower
Broken down transmission

But I'm going to take you
To my boxcar on the beach
And I'm going to hang the sun above your bed
And soak your hair in bleach

You'll be missed, Miss California
You'll be kissed by only me
When they can't find you
You'll turn into a mystery
But you're no mystery to me
Miss California

I called on Jesus
But he heard I hurt his little girl
Oh, with my reckless stare
I've been so unfair
Misplacing my affections
She had a reason not to take me back into her care
Oh, I'm just a stray dog now
I can't beg or bow
Just give me some direction

I'm going to take you
To the mansion where I hide
And I'm going to paint a diamond on your hand
You will be my bride

You'll be missed, Miss California
You'll be kissed by only me
When they can't find you
You'll turn into a mystery
But you're no mystery to me

You'll be missed, Miss California
We'll be married in the rain
When they can't find you

But they can't prove anything

I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow

I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody taking my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

[Verse 1]
Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact
You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back
I stay put I want you, I don't care I want you

[Verse 2]
It was me and you in love for a quick summer
Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
Shit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane cook
Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love

Always faded, lifted
Hit that corner whipped
Hit the dealer, whipped it
Always on it, mind your business
I'm always high, the sky ain't the limit
Ball like Melo, cars all tinted
Chain black and yellow, Pittsburgh Steelers
Sport it knocked it tossed it flipped it
Took my flow and switched it, took my dough invested
Your whole life is scripted
All we do is party, drinkin', molly raggin', shawty raggin'
Money come retarted huh, press the button start it up
Tryna be a dope boy ridin' with a coke boy
Strap with the low boy 50 for a show boy
Niggas made it rain I made I it snow boy
Started with a dollar and a hope boy
Now a nigga hot got millions in the bank

Montana piece look silly on the link
Montana and Wiz spend millys on the dank

So don't even take the chance or try to try my guy

Weed man say it's kinda dry
Potty mouth, rockstar, at the top and still tryna climb
Drop the top sit back recline
Hundred-K that's just the ride
Fifty-K that's just the change
Thirty-K that's just the time
Tour came that's just in time
That's more racks, that's more racks
Private plane you know that's flyin'
I'm boardin' that I'm boardin' that
Rollin' up smoke roy ridin' with the coke boy
Smoking on strong pack hit it once choke boy
When I'm on the road bottles like dope boy
When the police come, I don't really know boy
Half a pound in seven days that's smokin'
If you ain't bout your family or getting bread you jokin'

I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I would been thinking my life is so hard
And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

[Chorus]
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

[Verse 3]
I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
""I haven't had my story yet""

And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
""I love you dad""

When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

[Verse 2:]
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Loving might be a mistake
But it's worth making

Don't let some Hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

(Time is a wheel in constant motion
Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone)

[Bridge:]
I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean

I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and surviors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Gettin' mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was destined

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Brenda Russell]

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
Cuz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feelin', Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldn't panic

I done sold out before and re-comped the same night
Straight hopped the next flight, too *Icey* for sunlight

But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

Whoa

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

[Chorus - Modified]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive

I haven't seen you in forever
Oh you haven't changed a bit
You didn't think that I would remember
How could I forget

[Chorus]
We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice

[Verse 2]
To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

Guy: Baby...DAMN!

[Verse 1]
Come home late it seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gonna get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So If you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from

Day to day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse

[Chorus]
See I
Heard it all before
(Heard it all before)
All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk
Baby this, baby that
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down
(I had to shut you down)

Played the fool before
(Played the fool before)
I was your fool I believed in you
Yes I did, yes I did
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down
(I had to shut you down)

[Verse 2]
What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Have me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets

Nothing you can do and there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out, I am no longer concerned

[Chorus]
See I
Heard it all before
(Heard it all before)
""Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think""
That's what you said to me

Now I played the fool before

You had a good game, I must admit
I was it (I was it), but now it's over

I used to hang on to your every word
But the more you lie to me the more I hurt
The things you use to say would sound so sweet
I was naive quick to believe

I heard it all before

Baby, I swear it wasn't me!""
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now

Played the fool before

You were my boo, I trusted you
For way too long (Way too long)
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down

Heard it all before
You know you messed up
You got to know you messed up
You got to go now

223,Until The End Of Time,"[Produced By: Johnny J & Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again

So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]

I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Verse 3]
It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

[Verse 4]
Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright

I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood

Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh

Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu

Hit her where she doodie at, make the booty fat

Tight blue jeans, Air Max, small Gucci bag
No loot and no job, stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho

I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleeping in my bedroom when Henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on

I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth

Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

234,What It Feels Like For A Girl,"[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

[Outro: Madonna]

Do you know
Do you know

You saw me drive by your place last Friday

And when I pulled into the parking lot
I didn't see your car

That I’m the crazy ex that wrecks your life
But there's no intentions underneath the surface
So don’t go reading anything between the lines

'Cause I’m over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better
I didn’t miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I’m over you thinking that every move that I’m making
Is just a game that I’m playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I’m over you, I’m over you
So get over yourself, yeah
So get over yourself

[Verse 2]
You think all I do is talk about us
And that the new boy I show off is only out of spite
You’re so in your head about it
You can’t get your heart around it
But boy I’m over you
I’m over you

I’m over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better

Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18

Your background it ain't squeaky clean shit
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners
But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner
I respect that, man you're so phat, and you're all that, plus supreme
Then you're humble, man I'm numb with your feeling, I can feel everything that you bring

Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell

Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed, game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty, so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin' with my mental

Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life
Breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin' to other shit? You got the best here
Come on try your luck, shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin', vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down, I get down for this paper
16 lean from my pence so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line, my world, my way, any questions?

So hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now bitch, swallow it up while I shove it down
Make 'em love me over again and over your name
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookin' sad at me? I ain't to blame
Back to plan B, baby, I can feel your pain

You're just the best I ever had

So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't need me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it may take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
And I may find in time that you were always right
You're always right

255,Stranger In My House,"[Verse 1]
I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspence is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checkin' your clothes
And you wear the same size shoes
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are

[Chorus 1]
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
Cuz he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
You leave with no kisses
Goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell

So what could it be?
Is there someone immitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong
When I say

[Chorus 2]
There's a stranger in my house (There's a stranger in my house)
It took a while to figure out (It took a while to figure out)
There's no way you could be who you say you are (Ooooh)

Cuz he wouldn't touch me like that (Touch me like that)
And he wouldn't treat me like you do (Treat me like you do)
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me (Ooooh)

Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me
Have I changed so drastically?
Is it I want more for me?
And you remain the same

Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
Matter of fact, candy-paint Cadillacs kill
So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills
20-inch wide, 20-inches high
Ho, don't you like my 20-inch ride?
20-inch thighs make 20-inch eyes
Hoping for American 20-inch pies

Oh, how I love these pretty-ass hoes
Pretty-ass, high-class, anything goes
Catch 'em in the club throwing pretty-ass bows

Any stank puss make my long john pause
Women on their cell making long john calls
And if they like to juggle, get long john's balls

Turn me up in the headphone something
(New Joe Budden)
Look

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
First off let me shout out the fam, y'all so gracious
Been chilling in the room for growth, it's so spacious
Getting to the money, counting these old faces
Like I found the smoking gun in cold cases (nah)
Them dark thoughts never got to 'em still
I'm like the legendary Robin Will
Even though I understand
I never dealt with the pain like that
A knot from that same rope
But I don't hang like that
We had a couple break-ups
Gotta respect Cuzz and I'll hit the reset button
You try to reset Budden, it's real
My accomplishments
Already show 'em how I deal with the consequence
And you can ask Consequence
She reached out via text like ""What up with the guy?""
Which is weird, it's been a year
Since we fraternized
Still I made my way back in her life
Only to prove to myself I wouldn't fuck up twice
We reminiscing, thinking hella back
You had to watch me with her but to hell with that
Cause I think that me carrying that thought
Kind of washed me with her
And even that's cool cause me and you is not me and her
I took a little hiatus, hope you could see the change
I was too high to say this, how could I explain?
Though my mouth was quiet
My mind was like a Ferguson riot
Why it only get worse when I'm in private
Were we victims to the game
Trying to do it over
Here's the gift for an exchange
It's timeout for the public
These niggas won't know a thing
So we keep each other blocked on Twitter
It's not a game
Like a picture in a frame for now
Drunk models, couple Swishers and a stack here

[Hook: Felicia Temple]
Everytime I walk away, you need me
But your words don't mean a thing when you're not here
Tell me is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me is this the way
The way that you care

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
She said she wanna set boundaries
Can't continue to have you surrounding me
Cause that'll lead to you on this couch pounding me
That'll bring them feelings back
That's just out of bounds to me
It's been years, last bitch ain't come around to me
Send my tone of voice down
Like you speaking down to me
Said I said some things to begrudge you
But I can't ask to not be judged then judge you
She said; all this time I've been screaming ""Fuck You""
When she implies I can't move on I'm stuck too
Blood flowing, there's an adrenaline rush too
Every time I'm tryna leave
It's when you're in a rush too
She said; looking back I can see how you was gaming me
Which is fine, I can see how you could feel there
Which means I just gotta ask you one question though
If it was game tell me why them feelings still there?
I know the answer to that: you still fallin'
You ain't never felt so strong, it feels foreign
Probably got me saved in her phone as Phil Collins
Hear it in the air of the night it's still callin'
Every time you see me a couple of bills on him
Got rich then did it again we still ballin'
You ain't gotta respond to that
If you did it would look like it's a con to that
I'm so far beyond of that
Chillin' with a couple of hoes that like hoes
That like niggas that don't act like hoes
I don't say that cause I'm vain
Or some strangers can know I'm the man
We not fucking
Sometimes it's better knowing you can't
She come running back
Every time she throw in the can
Just to holla when she feel like not a soul understand
Baby, I already proved that I ride out
You can't bear to be hurt again so you hide out
You ain't gotta say that, I know you inside out
We communicate so well when all the pride's out
You gotta give it one more go, we ain't tried out
Nah that love wouldn't a been real if it died out

264,After Party,"[Verse 1]

This is what I did
Took a flight to Cali
And got my
Nigga ""Mustard on the beat ho""
I checked in at the hotel
Left the hotel and hit the club
Then the club got shut down
[What'd you do?]
I turned the hotel into a club

[Hook]

After party at the Marriott
Iced out my canary watch
[Yellow diamonds]
Hoes choose cause I'm very hot
[What'd you do?]
I just take 'em to the Marriott
From the stripclub, to the Marriott
From the liquor bar, to the Marriott
From the dance floor, to the Marriott
After party going down at the Marriott

[Verse 2]

Oh yeah, Mustard on the beat ho
It's 1:30 and I'm looking for a freak ho
I find that and it's time for a freakshow
Take that pussy, beat it up like Debo
I met a mama at a titty bar
Errybody probably know her, she a city star
Me? I just wanna cut her like a guillotine
She is not my lover, call her Billie Jean {MJ}
And I hope she got a girlfriend
DICK, I deliver like the dope man
Oops, I mean deliver like the post man
Get it girl, pop that pussy like a Coke can
I'm in the club blowing [dodo]
Drink got me [slow-mo]
Can't see shit like a microscopic [photo]
Too much charisma, [swag], mojo
Prime Time Click and G that's the logo

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

I do everything legendary
Nonfiction, y'all shit imaginary
We at the Hotel fucking Halle Berrys
Y'all at the crib playing Solitaire
Ya'll niggas at the crib on the internet
We in a suite smoking blunts like they cigarettes
Fucking hoes with some sexy ass silhouettes
Ask anybody, Prime Time Click been a threat
Very hot
We at the Marriott
At the top, eating Pappadeaux carryout
Canary watch, {bling} [wrist glowing up]
Got a bad bitch and a thick chick rolling up
(Optimo's?) and extendos
Smoking weed 'til we fogging up the windows
My niggas we fam' like the Winslow's
Tonight, we going whichever way the wind blows

[Hook]

[Verse 4]

Rolling up weed, pouring up drank
Throwing up $1's, I got money in the bank
Tonight we going hard, hard in the paint
Rolling up weed, pouring up drank
Girl get down [get up]
What a fine ass
Got a mama taking shot from a wine glass
And now she get loose as the time pass
Do it fast, let me see you throw that ass
To the floor, to the
Floor (x4)
To the ground, way down (x4)
Left cheek
Right cheek (x4)
Do it girl, double time (x4)

265,Guilty Until Proven Innocent,"[Intro: Jay-Z]
I thought this was America people!
Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?
That's how we working huh? Okay
Before me there was many; after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playing

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I get it down, anxiously the public can't wait
Niggas had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it crunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental Rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggas upsetting my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, trying to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still riding with toast
I ain't trying to collide with folk
But I don't want folk taking Jigga for joke
I guess you niggas just woke - good morning!

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I see how you coming at me now, I'm cool
I'm not the snitch, I don't go to the cops to get rich
.. I go to the block and pitch
I go with the Glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick
I go with you hard, I ain't gon' stop for shit
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbing my game
Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indicted
Got big money, big lawyers to fight it
Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
Y'all all know it, Jigga's a fighter
Plus I'm claustrophobic, back on the streets before you know it
And my word niggas, I heard you niggas
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever
B.I.G. is here, the soul of 2Pac hovers - above us

[Chorus: R. Kelly (Jay-Z)]
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. (uhh, I am the one)
What you want from me? Not guilty

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Uhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch
Got lame bitches trying to fuck with my case
Same lame bitch I bust in her face
Honey just mad I got her fucking replaced
Plus a birthday pass without me even touching my safe
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a better bitch
You heard the rhetoric: ""Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?""
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin gon' change
For nothing else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' 'cause I ride on the road
In what, most would describe as a Rolls
NO, that's that Continental T
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty

[Chorus: R. Kelly (Jay-Z)]
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
And you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis (I am the one)
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. what you want from me?
Not guilty

[Break: Jay-Z (R. Kelly)]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, I, am, the, one
(Y'all, cats, can't touch me)
Holla!

[Outro: R. Kelly]
So you can't touch me nigga, you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Said Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
And I got, all my, mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
I don't, know why, y'all can't see that

266,She Misses Him,"She shaves his face
She combs his hair
She helps him find his rocking chair
She cooks his meals
She wipes his mouth
And the window that he's looking out
She reads him books
She speaks his name
Oh every day is much the same
She sighs that sigh from deep within
The one that says
She misses him

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him

His children come on Saturday
They're at his feet
His grandkids play
It's sad they don't know him at all
He's just the one they call grandpa
They take out his trash
They mow his lawn
Things he can't do since he's been gone
She's grateful that they're pitching in
And like everyone
She misses him

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him

And yes they're still together
After all these years
But sometimes you can almost feel
The sadness in her tears

She misses his gentle touch
And the way he used to make her laugh
She misses the man he was
In all of those old photographs
So strong, so kind, so sweet, so smart
The man who stole her very heart
She misses him",Tim Rushlow,2001,"[97, 89, 84, 67, 61, 59, 61, 61, 61, 69, 74]",11

268,Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get In Da Club),"[Intro]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal, time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud in this motherfucker

{*barking*} Turn me up some
{*more barking} Yo
{*barking*}

[Red imitates an old woman]
Ohh shit! Who those motherfuckers coming in here?
No, it can't be! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

[Verse 1:Redman]
Yo.. yo, gimme some room I'm throwing elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'mma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm making the moves
Similar to the new Playstation 2
I can't help it if the club only packing a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3
And you balling ass niggas, whose dressed to kill
For the hoes showing the toes with extra heels (man!)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a car load of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggas hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500, through the door of the bitch

[DJ Kool]
Yo Red, wassup man?
Aye they ain't trying to let you in the club!
Yo, DJ Kool to the rescue!
We gon' break this joint down!

Yo, security patting my legs and waist
But if I vacate the place, it'll be {*gunfire, ""stay down!""*}
All my niggas in the huddle, on the count of three
We gonna bum rush the tunnel, with a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here
Blazing like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm acting a fool
Like a three o'clock bully, waiting after school
(Punks!) I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helping my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in
JUMP, MOVE, CRASH, SMOKE, DRINK
Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pouring
Since +Def+ is the label I belong in a morgue!
I'm walking half-dead, acting senile
With bigger niggas from jail than the one on ""Green Mile""
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown

[DJ Kool]
Yeah that's right! We up in this joint now
Ayo we getting ready to take over
Freddie, you grab the mic, I'mma grab the turntables
We gon' rock this joint baby! - a-huh, a-huh, ahh!

They circled around us
And toasted to forever

But it ain't easy to keep your love alive
We hoped each other would come around
We'll use the lessons for better luck next time
But how sweet it was back then

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight

My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas

Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—

Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

How to sell your game right on time

Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be

Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip

The fact that I don't want another girl

I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

But dancin' is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite

They make me sick
I know I feel you, that is why we got to stick together

[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it is driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

[Verse 1]
He was doing 8-0 on the freeway
In the 6 double O, bumping Islay
He was getting kind of close, kind of touch-ay
Because he had a little too much Hennessey
He told me that he want to go home, with me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, ""Boo, I do not really know though""
He got closer to me it started getting deep
He had me in a zone when he started to show me things
I never saw before
Baby was smooth but I knew it was game
Hell-of-a cool but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick

[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it is driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick

[Verse 2]
In the 6 now, so hot
Got to pull all the windows down
Eyes lead and I am thinking bout the sheets now
Wondering should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this?
Kind of funny, but I was not even nervous
Well his slick-ass lines were kind of working
I felt my knees get weak his body was calling me
Just could not take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
Said, he was too schooled to be screaming my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this

[Chorus]
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I'm feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it's driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me going again
Baby, you got me going again
You make me sick
You make me sick
I want you and I am hating it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip, I am feeling it, I got to get a grip
And it's driving me crazy baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it

With no blacks, no Jews and no gays

There but for the grace of God go I

Papi and the family left the dirty streets
To find a quiet place overseas
And year after year the kid has to hear
The do's, the don'ts and the dears
And when she's ten years old she digs that Rock 'n' Roll
But Papi bans it from home

There but for the grace of God go I

Baby, she turns out to be a natural freak
Gaining weight and losing sleep
And when she's sweet sixteen, she packs her things and leaves
With a man she met on the street

But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her

I'll let you know""

With the sun in the sky, but night's coming soon
And I walk to the mirror just to fix myself
Yeah, life gets harder when you love nothing else
So I pick up my pills from the counter drawer
Pick my self-esteem up off the fucking floor
I guess I'm a man of no recourse
As I crack another bottle, got no remorse
And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me
I swear I used to be one, I truly believed
That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
That even I can go to heaven if I part the sea, so...

People get sick, and they'll watch you bleed
When you fall from the top, boy you better believe
At the bottom, they got just, yeah, just what you need
But at the bottom, you can't swim 'cause you drank up the sea
When we stop, and we look up to the sky
They don't ask any questions, they ask us why
Don't have any answers, don't know what to say
Our knees are getting tired, too tired to pray
That's when we lay down, end of the road
We all seem to walk it, guess I walked it alone
And I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
Even I can go to heaven if I part the sea, so…

Time just seems to go on and on
On and on and on and on
Life inside a bottle, all along
All along, the bottle's gone

What's life inside a bottle if it's gone?
One more song and I'm finally free
I'll meet you here in heaven between the sea
'Cause I'm not just a man with these broken dreams
Even I can go to heaven if I part the sea, so…

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I wear more bling to The Source and Soul Trains
More chains than rings, niggas won't do a thing
I bangs the four-four in plain daylight; I'm deranged
Spray right at your brain; by the way, this is Hov
One-shot Dillinger, one shot killin' ya
It's only one Roc La Familia
Sigel lock Philly up, Brooklyn is me
Matter-fact, the East Coast—fuck took it from me?
Fourth album, still Jay, still spitting that real shit
Volume 3, still sold more records than Will Smith
Can't call this a comeback, I run rap, the fuck is y'all saying?
Five million? I done that, and I've come back
To do it again! (Uh-huh)

283,That's How I Beat Shaq,"[Intro]
And it goes, and it goes
And it goes a little something like this
Hit It!
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
I wanna make it back
Here we go
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
I wanna make it back

[Verse 1]
Yo guys, check out, guess what happened to me
(Another crazy story, come on AC)
I was hanging at the court, just playing some ball
Working on my game (yeah, we heard it all)
I heard the fans screaming, I thought it was for me
But then I saw a shadow, it was 12 foot 3
It was Shaquille O'Neal (what? What did he say?)
(How 'bout some one-on-one, you wanna play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad, try not to cry
(Please Aaron, are you for real?
One-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal?)
Yeah, 34 center from the L.A. Lakers
(You must've been nervous) I knew I could take him
Stared at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes

[Chorus]
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

[Verse 2]
So check it out, I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks (was he hitting all the shots?)
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop
I had a plan, I could change the pace
I said, ""Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace""
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess you're getting nervous 'cause you already lost

[Chorus]
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

[Bridge]
Dunk after dunk, jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering (Aaron's the man)
Dunk after dunk, jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering (Aaron's the man)

[Verse 3]
Announcers were shocked, couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up, I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
But the ball went in, then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too and we can still be friends
The fans went nuts, they put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice and it sounded like my mother's
(Get up for school, you're gonna be late)
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing a game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
How'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal? Woah

[Chorus]
Boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
Boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts

284,Don't Tell Me,"[Produced by No I.D.]

[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was ""bye"" more, ""fuck you""
""Who is that"" and ""I don't know why"" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke

[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Can substitute the time you take (The time you take)
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart (Don't cost a thing)
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true (Ooh)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't

Shake that ass, drop that pussy but stay in line ho

292,It Wasn't Me,"[Intro (spoken): Rikrok & Shaggy]
Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yeah, what do you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You let her catch you?
I don't know how all of this happened
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright...

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say, “a night”, convince her, say, “a day”
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, “Baby, no way!”

[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn’t me)
Heard the screams getting louder (Wasn’t me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident, you betta know fe mask
Quick 'pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know, you betta run fast

[Bridge: Rikrok]
Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason
It makes no sense at all
People tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Cuz you don't need me, so I'll set you free
There's a long road ahead
But I'll find a way

It's not that I want to watch you leave
But it's all ending now
I have to let you go

I hope you find what you're looking for
I hope he makes you happy the way you need

'Cause I might change my mind

Would never ever get too close
Didn't ever wanna lose control

I knew that I would have to chase it

And love could sustain us through every fight
I let go of all of the other pretenders
They were wasting my time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the start
That I might give you my heart

Knew that I would never let you

You can make me

Until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes
The sky's a different blue
Cross my heart

That you believed my lies

You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me

And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever??
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

298,Burn,"[ELIZA]
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said

“Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.”

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you…

I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn",Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,2001,"[94, 89, 82, 75, 63, 54, 44, 42, 45, 45, 51, 51, 53, 59, 72]",15

Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

[Verse 2]
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Bridge]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Verse 3]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

[Bridge]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

Memories are just where you leave them
Drag the waters, 'til the depths give up their dead
What did you expect to find?
Was it something you left behind?
Don't you remember anything I said when I said

Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

""Am I the only place that you've left to go?""

Some movie, black and white
Dead actors faking lines
Over and over and over again she cries

Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

You don't remember, but I do
You never even tried

Each loving day
I know this feeling won't go away (no)

You know I can't let you slide through my hands

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

[Verse 2]
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

[Verse 3]
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time

It started out as a feeling
Which then grew into a hope
Which then turned into a quiet thought
Which then turned into a quiet word
And then that word grew louder and louder
'Til it was a battle cry

[Chorus]
I'll come back when you call me
No need to say goodbye

Just because everything's changing
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before

As you head off to the war
Pick a star on the dark horizon and follow the light

[Chorus]
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Now we're back to the beginning
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet
But just because they can't feel it too
Doesn't mean that you have to forget
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger

You'll come back when they call you
No need to say goodbye
You'll come back when they call you
No need to say goodbye",Regina Spektor,2001,"[97, 83, 58, 52, 56, 60]",6

Can't get enough of this everyday love

Each morning the sun shines through my window
Lands on the face of a dream come true

And catch up on the front page morning news
Then she walks up behind me
And throws her arms around my neck

Every afternoon I make a phone call
Listen to the voice that warms my heart

Then head on home to try and beat the dark
Her smile will be right there
When I step through that door
And it will be that way tomorrow
Just like every day before

320,A Good Day To Run,"I'm tired of working every day for a dollar
About to choke on my own blue collar
This ain't gonna last
Misled by the grand illusion
I've come to this conclusion
I can't make a move too fast
It was written in the sky today
By the morning sun it sure looks like a good day to run

Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run

My baby's been working as a cashier

She didn't get a vacation this past year
Now it won't be long
We don't need no destination
Just a tank of gas and a good clear station
Playing our favorite song
There're some places that we ain't been
Some things we ain't done
And it sure looks like a good day to run

Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done

[Verse 1]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters!

N-now th-that that don't kill me

I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby, you're makin' it

Lettin a nigga cum all over her chest and tongue

Ain't sellin records but her mouth could sell a million
If you wanna take it there we can break it off

And my name is Jay-Z
She was all on my dick
Gradually I'm taking over your bitch
Coming over your shit
Got my feet up on you sofas, man
I mean a hostess for my open hand
You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch up in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'mma pimp her, it's over man
When I twist her in the Gold sedan
Like I'm Goldie man, you're bitch chose man
Jigga man, iceberg with the frozen hands
Wedding bands don't make it rosy man

Yo check it now, yo, yo

Recognize a pimp, open your eyes
Hop in the passenger side of the ride
Damn Bleek, can't speak
Uh-huh, okay, what's up, SHUT UP
And close the door
Act like you been in the drop top
On the open road before
Fix your weave, then fix me
Ever gave head doing 160?
Ever seen a pair of kicks this crispy
How you love how the white wife beater fit me
M-dot, him hot, them not

Chrome gleaming like the dome off Keenan
Gone while I'm leanin' smoking
I'm whip it in the stomach
Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money
Why you acting so funny?
You know she been flirting while your working
Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain
Poppin' that pussy
Sweatin' till no fluid is left
When I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Can't help it if she yellin' with a ridah

How she say Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all
You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch

It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick

And I was digging that down since '96 shit
Memph man I'll take your bitch
Let her do her thing, give brain in the whip
And you know how it go when it come to the hoes

Got your wife callin' me daddy
Put her out on the street let her get that cheese

From catz who order Cris play the floor with the Knicks

330,My Next Thirty Years,"[Verse 1]
I think I’ll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it’s time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

[Verse 2]
Hey my next thirty years I’m going to have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I’ve done
Maybe now I’ve conquered all my adolescent fears
And I’ll do it better in my next thirty years

[Verse 3]
My next thirty years I’m going to settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I’m doing here
In my next thirty years

[Verse 4]
Oh my next thirty years, I’m going to watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I’ll remember my next thirty years

[Verse 5]
My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years

Got all these hoes in my DM (yeah, I do)

Walking down the street and ain’t nobody know my name (whoa)
Ain’t no paparazzi flashing pictures, this is great (whoa)
Ain’t nobody judging 'cause I’m black or my controversial past
I’ma go and see a movie and relax (woo)
Ayy, I’m a Blood but I can finally wear blue (cool)
Why his momma calling all the time?
Leave me the fuck alone, bitch

If I was Lil Dicky in my body, where would I be?
I’m tryna to find myself like an introspective monk
I’m balling on the court, oh my god I can dunk
Snap a flick of my junk
My dick is trending on Twitter? Fuck
Now I’m at the club, I talked my way into getting in
I look up in the VIP, my goodness there I am
I signal to him to let me in but he won’t let me in
I don’t know who that is
Wait, who the fuck he think he is?
Took a glass bottle, shatter it on the bouncer's head (woo)
Walked up to that motherfucker
Wait, think it through for a sec
If you hurting me then you only hurting yourself
But wait, I love myself
That was the key, now we're switching back

332,Born To Fly,"[Verse 1]
Searching for the answers
A memory so far below
I'm better, stronger, faster
But is there more that I don’t know?

[Pre-Chorus]
All these flashes within my mind
I need to find the key that's in my past
All this power I feel inside
It's time to make my stand

[Chorus]
I’m not sending no apologies
I'm not holding back any longer
You wanna keep me down,I'd like to see you try
(hey hey hey)
You're not getting what you want from me
What didn't kill me made me stronger
You wanna hold me down, I'd like to see you try
Cause I was born to fly

[Verse 2]
The universe in chaos
But maybe I was made for more
Don't know if I'm a hero
But I’m the one to end this war

[Pre-Chorus]
All these flashes within my mind
I need to find the key that’s in my past
All this power I feel inside
It's time to make my stand

You wanna keep me down,I'd like to see you try

Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breach through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I passed 'em
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and outlast 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em
While you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof, roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit; you give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?
A sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex: make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown: that's the way I like it, twerk
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat!
Factories or one hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream ""help!"" Play my game!
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

337,I Wish,"[Intro]
Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true
Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach, overcometh by thoughts
Of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

339,Shape Of My Heart,"[Verse 1]
He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect
He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Verse 2]
He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While a memory of it fades

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

That's not the shape, the shape of my heart

[​​Harmonica Solo]​​

[Verse 3]
And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one
But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

340,We Danced,"[Verse 1]
The bar was empty
I was sweeping up the floor
That's when she walked in
I said, ""I'm sorry but we're closed""
And she said ""I know
But I'm afraid I left my purse""
I said, ""I put one back behind the bar
I bet it's probably yours""
And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, ""You'll only get this back on one condition""

[Chorus]
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

[Verse 2]
And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evening
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, ""This is the last thing I expected""
And then she took me by the hand
And said, ""I'll only marry you on one condition""

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Like no one else had ever danced before

341,Still On Your Side,"I'm still on your side

You found a place where you belong
New friends that can do no wrong
That's what you believe
But who is going to be there when you fall
To build up when you're feeling small
Give you love that you need
Who will, I will
When the whole world turns against you
Ain't no lie

Don't you know that I will stand up for you
No matter what you're going through
I'm still on your side
Any time, day or night
Don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm still on your side

You want to run you want to break free
What you want ain't what you need
Can't you see that I care
I know I'm hard on you sometimes
But when you are looking for the things you can't find
Don't you know who'll be there
Who will, I will
When it's more than you can handle
Ain't no lie

Don't you know that I will stand up for you
No matter what you're going through
I'm still on your side
Any time, day or night
Don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm still on your side

I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there when you need me
I won't let you go
There's nothing I won't do, I'll be there

Don't you know that I will stand up for you
No matter what you're going through
I'm still on your side
Any time, day or night
Don't care if it's wrong or right
I'm still on your side

I will be around when the others let you down
I'm still on your side
Anytime you need help and you can't find nobody else
I'm still on your side",BBMak,2001,"[92, 82, 67, 58, 61, 54, 64, 67]",8

347,Just Another Day In Paradise,"The big cold city was such a lonely place to be
Hustle all day and dream of the islands and sea
Millions of girls but none of them seemed right for me
'Till you came along and you touched me and set me free

So we slipped away last night eased on down to the Keys
Flying so high we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze
Living on love and the fruits from tropical trees
With a song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

A bottle rum listen to the steel drum band
Laughing in the moonlight along the beach we ran
Splashing naked in the sea making love upon the sand
Falling fast asleep like children hand in hand

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

I woke up this morning with the sunlight in my eyes
Guess it was only a dream I hear the city outside
But I look at you sleeping and honey now I realize
That anywhere with you is paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise",Bertie Higgins,2001,"[79, 74, 70, 63, 58, 62]",6

My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—See? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you, damn…",Eminem,2001,"[100, 93, 88, 77, 69, 70]",6
352,Gotta Tell You,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowin' inside me like never before
Your love for me, somethin' I didn't see
But baby, I know better now
When you walked in the room that very night
A special feelin' just burst inside
There was only you, nobody else
But baby, I know better now

[Chorus]
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
And now you're back inside my house again
I'm tryin' deeper to explain
'Cause baby, I wanna get it on
And baby, you're the one for me
But now that I have got you all alone
After all this talkin' on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong, where you belong

[Chorus]
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me (If you don't love me)
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me (If you don't love me)
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight

[Bridge]
It was just something in your eyes
That made me realize
But now I hear voices deep inside
Tellin' me, tellin' me
It's you and I

[Chorus]
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me (If you don't love me)
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right

353,Meanwhile Back At The Ranch,"So, meanwhile back at the ranch
My boy, you grovel for an olive branch
Your arms outstretched, fabrication spoken
You severed all ties and the bond was broken

You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy
And it makes me sick
You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy
In a bit

Meanwhile back at the bar
Big time Charlie gone to far
Bore him with your stories
From all that you know
You know everything from Wikipedia and it shows

Because he's full of shit and so are you
You're a weasel and I've had a bird's eye view

You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy
It makes me sick

So everyone is at your place
Cameras out for Facebook
Shoe in the face, not one is a friend
There is a reason for this
The pragmatics of which you've seem to have missed

You are the gaffer's best boy
20 sleazy and coy
And it makes me sick
You are the gaffer's best boy

354,You Should've Told Me,"[Verse 1]
I wouldn't call in the midnight hour
I wouldn't tuck you in and turn the nightlight out
You would walk through the door and I wouldn't say hi
I would walk out the door and wouldn't say bye-bye
It's funny that I never thought about it that way
I never knew the things that I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world
Thinking I'm a perfect lady

[Chorus]
You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

[Verse 2]
I wasn't there to help you take your clothes off
When it was time for work didn't see you off
When your tense didn't give a massage
I never told you I think you're hot
It's funny I never thought about it that way
Never knew the things I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world
Thinking I'm a perfect lady

[Chorus]
You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

[Bridge]
When you thought you had to lie
Why didn't you come and tell me why?
Didn't you see those tears I cried?
Oh why?

[Outro]
You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time

I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough

Made me lose my mind

A-ooh-ah-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell, I even fucked with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

Beatin' they dicks to the double-X-L magazine (uhh)
You like how I look in the aqua green? Get your Vaseline
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby, oh, yes oh!
Jailer, open up cell, block eight
Alright nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster

Eses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs
Up North in the hole, they all wanna know

If you drivin' in the street hold on to your seat
Niggas, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
(Shoom!) That's me the Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste, niggas got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

Oh baby when she moves, she moves
I go crazy 'cause she looks like a flower

She reminds me that a woman's
Got one thing on her mind

We'll dance until the band goes home
Then you're gone, yeah baby

Considering everything's a mess
There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk, but I'll just drive
It's colder than it looks outside

Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya
Try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time because the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile when ya
Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
Try to figure out what all this is for

[Verse 2]
It's the perfect time of day
To throw all your cares away
Put the sprinkler on the lawn
And run through with my gym shorts on
Take a drink right from the hose
And change into some drier clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Sleep away the afternoon

It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone when ya
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya
Try to see the world beyond your front door

Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
Try to figure out what all this is for

Asleep

Tell me

On an evening such as this
It's hard to tell if I exist
If I packed a car and leave this town
Who'll notice that I'm not around?
I could hide out under there
I just made you say 'underwear'
I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway

[Chorus]
It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone when ya
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya

Keeping my feet on the ground

I'll be right there if you call

363,The Itch,"Heavenly father up above
Have mercy on me
After 7 years of bad bad love
I finally got free
I don't mean to seem ungrateful
You answered my prayers
And father if you're able
Don't let me do the same damn thing all over again

You get the fever
You get the itch
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money the lawyers and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over again

Oh mighty father great and good
You need to be in my shoes
You let me fall in love just like before
And now I'm stepping in a big pile of the blues
But now the honeymoon is over
Let's not pretend
I guess I never
Learned my lesson
I did the same damn thing all over again

You get the fever
You get the itch
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money the lawyers and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over again

Mother Mary, father Joe
I need to talk to your son
He had troubles just like mine
And he's the chosen one
So if I ever go to heaven, will that be the end?
Or will I fall for some sweet little angel
And do the same damn thing all over again

You get the fever
You get the itch
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money, the lawyers and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over again",Keb’ Mo’,2001,"[100, 95, 76, 58]",4

365,The Little Girl,"[Verse 1: John Michael Montgomery]
Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name, never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

[Verse 2: John Michael Montgomery]
Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out

[Chorus 1: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life

[Verse 3: John Michael Montgomery]
And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life

[Chorus 2: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad, kisses and hugs everyday

[Verse 4: John Michael Montgomery]
Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, I know that man up there on that cross
I don't know His name, but I know He got off

[Chorus 3: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
'Cause He was there in my old house and held me close to His side
As I hid there behind our couch, the night that my parents died",John Michael Montgomery,2001,"[74, 74, 83]",3
366,Feels Like Love,"So many nights I sit and wonder
Why do I feel the way I do?
Maybe my heart is tryin' to tell me somethin'
Maybe I'm fallin' in love with you

[Bridge]
Girl, your voice is keepin' me up all night
You got me tossing and turning
When we touch, baby, it feels so right
Like startin' all over again

[Chorus]
This time it feels like love
So strong, one in a million
This time it feels like love to me

They say that love don't last forever
Well, I'd be the last to disagree
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
It's such a touchy thing (touchy thing, touchy thing)
But we've got a love that's meant to be, oh yeah

(Bridge)

(Chorus)
Sometimes it hurts like hell
Sometimes you just can't tell
This time it feels like love to me

For once in my life I'm sure of where I wanna be
I'm takin my eye off the door
Cause I found love and love's found me

Excuse me, I know we just met
But may I have this dance?

[Verse 1: Nathan]
Sitting here with a drink in my hand
Your presence I can't ignore
I must admit I like watching you dance
But it seems like I've seen this before
Girl, you look like my first wife
Though I've never been married before
So I kiss your hand and tell you, ""Thank you""
You turn and ask me, ""What for?""

[Chorus]
For our first kiss on next week
For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore
Proudly three months from now
For when you said, ""I do"", next March
And for those beautiful children of ours

But I thank you in advance

Hi, my name is Shawn
Tell me your name although I know the last one

Same hand

I don't mean to sound so bold and forward
But I thank you in advance

369,A Little Gasoline,"Throwing pictures out the window
Scattered by the way the wind blows
Bye-bye, baby, that's the last I'll see of you
Shoebox full of old love letters
I'll tear each one till I feel better
And I won't look back 'cause I don't like the view

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline

We talked in circles till the words ran out
And it all came down to an angry shout
Before I knew it, I was in third gear and gone
Well, this had been coming for a long, long time
If I said, ""I'm sorry,"" well, I'd be lying
If you think I'll never make it, well, you'd be wrong

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings

374,Go On,"[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

[Verse 1: Lil Bow Wow]
Around here we pop them collars
Around here we get them dollars
Every girl I see that look right
A nigga like me just gotta holla
This kid here all about stackin' up
Got big head but we can back it up
Long cause everybody get crunk
When we drop in the club starts acting up
I represent the S-O-S-O, D-E-F-M-O-B
That's me, JD, Brat, and JE
So please believe
What I do ain't never been done
Ohio is where I'm from
I heard what you said
And I saw what you do
And y'all playas really don't want none
From the day to the night, I ROCK
Say what you like, NEVER NOT
Stayin' alive, living the life
Gots to keep it hot
Shotgun in the drop, riding good
Twenties, TVs, leather and wood
Poppin', watching Big Momma
Holdin' it down like a playa should
Sing-a-long now!

[Chorus: Xscape]
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me

[Verse 2: Lil Bow Wow]
It's the B to the O-W
Wow even your girl fall in love
When I smile
The tight little guy you ain't seen in a while
Ignore the hype, just right for you size
I get in where I fit in
Braided up, made the bucks
And I'm still a kid
Imagine what life like when I get big
I'mma be rich surrounded by chicks
Couple of cars, couple of cribs
Gettin' a couple of mills
Shining every time I feel
You see how So So get ill
You don't want no stuff up in here
Bow to the wow get it in your ear now
I get down cause I'm hit bound
And I rock an iced out Mickey Mouse around my neck
And I hang on niggas like Vince Carter
With his arm in the net
And I outta snatch up your daughters
But I was brought up with respect
When I turn 16 I'mma call her though
And show her how to ride with a baller yo
Let her know why it wouldn't hurt her
To fall in love with a {nigga} like me a long time ago
Sing-a-long now!

[Chorus: Xscape]
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me

376,The Christmas Shoes,"[Verse 1]
It was almost Christmas time
And there I stood in another line
Trying to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me
Was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes
And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say

[Chorus]
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

[Verse 2]
He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the Cashier said, ""Son, there's not enough here""
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said, ""Mama made Christmas good at our house
Though most years she just did without""
""Tell me, sir, what am I going to do
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes""
So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
""Mama's gonna look so great""

[Chorus]
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

[Bridge]
I knew I'd caught a glimpse of Heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me, what Christmas is all about

[Chorus]
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

[Outro]
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight",NewSong,2001,[42],1
377,Where Are You Christmas?,"Where are you christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away

Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't i hear music play

My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too

Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know

Im not the same one
See what the time has done
Is that why you have let me go

Christmas is here. everywhere
Christmas is here... if you care

If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time

I feel you Christmas
I know i found you
U never fade away

The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Builds each and every heart with love

Where are you Christmas
Fill our hearts with love",Lauren DeLeary,2001,[65],1
378,Open My Heart,"[Verse 1:]
Alone in a room
It's just me and you
I feel so lost
'Cause I don't know what to do
Now what if I choose the wrong thing to do
I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you

[Chorus:]
So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life is so cloudy
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart
Oh yeah

[Verse 2:]
My hopes and dreams
Are fading fast
I'm all burned out
And I don't think my strenghts gonna last
So I'm crying out
Crying out to you
Lord I know that you're the only one
Who is able to pull me through

[Chorus:]
So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life seems so cloudy
Lord guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart

[Bridge:]
So show me how
To do things your way
Don't let me make the same mistakes
Over and over again
Your will be done
And I'll be the one
To make sure that it's carried out
And in me I don't want any doubt
That's why...

[Chorus:]
I need to talk to you, yes I do
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life seems just a little bit cloudy
Lord you can guide me through
Thats why I open up
I open up my heart, my heart
My heart, my heart

All I need to do is hear a single word from you
I open up my heart
Just one word could make a difference in what I do, Lord
(Guide until I'm sure)
I open my heart to you
You just say one word, one word, one word
One word, one word, one word
I open up my heart to you

You're the lover of my soul
Captain of my sea
I need a word from you
That's why I open up my heart",Yolanda Adams,2001,[89],1
379,I Know,"[Produced by DJ Mustard & Key Wane]

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Outro: Big Sean]
I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places other niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the makeup, yeah",Big Sean,2001,[98],1
380,Kiss This,"[Verse 1: Luke Spiller]
Thomas said stay home

I'm gone for good
Making up stories
Keeping it secret
Taking your word for truth
You were bad for me

I did all I could
So kiss this one more time
Cause I'm gone for good

So kiss this one last time
And I'm gone for good

Coming home crawling
Didn't give a shit before
He stole from me
So I'm gone for good
Getting back from this no second chances
Another phone call ignored
You are back for me
But I'm gone for good

I did all I could
So kiss this one more time
Cause I'm gone for good

So kiss this one last time

In the night's out
The ones you thought are hidin' undercover
