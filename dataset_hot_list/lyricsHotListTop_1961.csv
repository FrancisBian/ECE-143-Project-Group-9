1,Run To Him,"[Verse 1]
Just when the party is over
The thrill is gone
I hear a new voice saying
He's only begun
He says that He wants to guide me
To brighter days
He said He would walk beside me
And open up a way

[Chorus 1]
So I will run to Him
So I will run to Him
Lord, I am running
For Your living water
Ooo hallelujah

[Verse 2]
I heard of His name in stories
And Sunday songs
But my image of Him was distant
My image was wrong
Turns out He's so much closer
And oh so deep
My faith in Him so much bolder
My direction is clear

[Chorus 1]
So I will run to Him
So I will run to Him
Lord, I am running
For Your living water
Ooo hallelujah
So I will run to Him
So I will run to Him
Lord, I am running
For Your living water
Ooo hallelujah

[Bridge 1]
What are you waiting for?
I here He's still turning water into wine
What are you waiting for?
Yes. He's still giving sighs to the blind
His pure perfection is no mystery
So I will testify
And when He [?] the sky
I'll do all that I can with me

[Chorus 2]
Why don't you run to Him?
Why don't you run to Him?
Lord, I'm running
For Your living water
Ooo hallelujah
Why don't you run to Him?
Why don't you run to Him?
Lord, I'm running
For Your living water
Ooo hallelujah
Lord, I'm running
For Your living water
Ooo hallelujah
Lord, I'm running
For Your living water
Ooo hallelujah

4,Walk On By,"All the things that I do
All the hell I’ve been through
It somehow doesn’t matter
I see the light and it moves
Reaching I can’t break through (break through x3)

I’m walking on the dark side - I can’t get away
I’m flirting with disaster - It’s the price I pay
Feelings of hopelessness engulf me everyday
Yet I walk on by walk on by

All I do to get through
All this pain is subdued
It always comes back smarter
I see the dark and it soothes

Freaking out I can’t move (can’t move x3)

I’m walking on the dark side - I can’t get away
I’m flirting with disaster - It’s the price I pay
Feelings of hopelessness engulf me everyday
Yet I walk on by walk on by x3

And they’re searching for me
Trying to steal and dissect my time
Always they’re beating and constantly screaming inside
And they’re ripping in me
And they’re taking my happiness making it worthless
And they’re leaving me here to die

I feel them laughing at me
I feel them snapping at me
I feel the pressure inside building ‘til I try to break free

I can’t believe what I’ve done
I should have never begun
I feel the pressure inside telling me I never was the one

I feel them laughing at me
I feel them snapping at me
I feel them laughing at me
I feel them snapping at me

I’m walking on the dark side - I can’t get away
I’m flooding with disaster - It’s the price I pay
Feelings of hopelessness engulf me everyday

Tonight's the night
I've waited for
Because you're not a baby anymore
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen

What happened to
That funny face
My little tomboy now wears satins and lace
I can't believe my eyes
You're just a teenage dream

I was your big brother
Then when you were ten
We didn't like each other
When you were thirteen
You were my funny valentine
But since you've grown up
Your future is sewn up
From now on you're gonna be mine so

If I should smile with sweet surprise
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen

17,Big Bad John,"Big John
Big John

Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, ""Hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Скит: MORGENSHTERN & Эмир Моргенштерн]
— Расскажи, что тебя, что тебя беспокоит
— Ну грустно, школа, я не знаю языка и всё такое
— А ты знаешь, что человек настроение только сам себе делает?
— Нет
— Да. Никто, кроме тебя, настроение тебе не сделает
— Почему?
— Никто, кроме тебя, не влияет на твоё настроение. Вот как ты сам решил, так и будет
— Влияет
— Нет, это неправда, это, это глупо. Жизнь не влияет ни на что, ты сам её должен создавать. Вот если ты сам для себя решил «всё, это, мне весело», то тебе весело. А если ты сам для себя решил «мне грустно», то тебе грустно, это так работает. Ты просто вот сам должен попробовать это и понять. Ты ещё очень маленький, у тебя очень много времени
— А у тебя?
— Ну, у меня тоже, я тоже молодой
— Нет, ты старый
— Ну не, мне всего двадцать, ну ты, не, не говори мне такого
— Старый!
— Братан, перед тобой огромный мир, ты посмотри, посмотри на это. Огроменный мир. Ты знаешь сколько всего ты можешь сделать, чёрт возьми? Так переставай. Улыбнись, дурак! Улыбнись, блин! Ха-ха

Small Sad Sam!

Here's a tale of a man
Who was puny and weak
Stood 4 ft 6 in his stockin' feet
Kinda narrow in the shoulder 'n' heavy in the waist
Everything about him seemed to be misplaced
Small Sam!

Small Sad Sam!

He slid into town, one rainy night
Running like a dog, away from a fight
He had a pretty big mouth for a guy his size
And everything he said was a pack of lies!
Small Sam!

Small Sad Sam!

One day he got on a downtown bus
First thing you know, there was an awful fuss
They threw Sam off into the street
For trying to steal an old lady's seat
That's Sam!

Small Sad Sam!

One day, nobody knows what for
An elevator stuck on the 85th floor
Some cables broke, and so it's said
That car just hung there by a thread
The women were calm, the men were mild
But Sam screamed and cried like a little child
He squeezed himself through the emergency door
And pulled himself up to the 86th floor
Small Sam!
Chicken Sam!

That Chicken Sam!

And then instead of helping others get free
Sam said, ""I'm looking out for me""!
The cable snapped and all the way down they cursed out Sam until they, hit the ground
Small Sam!

Small Sad Sam!

Now someday Sam is gonna get his due
And when he does I'll make a bet with you!
There ain't nobody, even gonna pass the hat
'cause Sam was nothing but a no good rat!

We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems, many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us, try to help us
Before this clay and granit planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two

I cannot talk
I gotta fucked up brain
Fucked up thoughts
I thought I was ok

Hit your whole city up
Hit you while you laying down
Shots leave you sittin up
Run in the bathroom on your girl and get a titty fuck
Right after I bust a nut I bust the gun get rid of her
Y'a bunch of pussy’s having a pity party
My guns look like they in kindergarten
I’m the dirtiest seed in any garden
Got more stripes on my sleeve than any sergeant
The paralyzed feel me, the blind see me
And the deaf can hear me
And the smart fear me
Wh-which side you on?
Hi-highway to heaven, I would drive you home

Medication in my cup, it's cause my flow's sick
Got a syringe in my drawers, call it dope dick

Ain't heard a word from my old friends
Heard they wanna kick my doors in
I done loaded up the 2-2-3
I'm so high they might call a goaltend, yeah
Lord knows, stashed work in the console
So many autos in my garage, I can't open my car door
Bond on me like the sun on me
Gettin' this bread she say, ""You dropped crumbs on me""
Walked in the club and got ones only
Need a tat on my stomach that say prawns only

Most of my partnas got charges
And I ain't talking about no mothafuckin' dodges
Trappin' up outta the college

Raised by a single parent Black woman
They call me Tity Boi 'cause she used to spoil me

Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have me another for a wedding

And I really put on quite a show

[Intro: Dion]
Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love, then ran around
With every single guy in town

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Um, so I said ""Peace!,"" and I left it
Can't get mad at me when your actions request it
Couldn't even tell me to my face, had to text it
You can pack your bags, follow signs to the exit
Yes, move it along please, pronto
Oh, and by the way, return your keys to the condo
If you played at the Apollo
You'd be the type of act that I would boo off stage
While I throw you a tomato
A tough act to follow, but you fooled me, bravo
Can't believe I fell for your bull, Chicago
Can't believe you asked me to stay, nah, hoe
I'm outta here with rocket power, babe, Otto

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Well, I should've known she would run around
Chill for a second, then peace when the Summer's down
Now, how dumb I sound, ever since I fell for the apple of my eye?
Cupid always keeps his gun around
When I smash, she was like a woman from the past
A Mary Tyler Moore with more ass
Should've figured something when she let me score fast
But I was misguided, thinking she had more class
Nah, I couldn't be wronger
Fuck it anyways, it was time to move onward
I'm tripping no longer
Put her on the streets like a Banksy
'Cause I was too swanky, and she was too skanky

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins

That September, in the rain

The leaves of brown, came tumbling down

I remember, I remember when I lost my mind

And when you're out there without care

But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice

You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

[Verse 3]
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy

Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah",Leonard Cohen,1961,"[60, 66, 83, 94]",4

Gonna feel fine
And once you dance with me
You'll fall in love you see

The Bristol Stomp will make you mine

The stars are spinnin every Friday night
They dance the greatest if they do it right
But it's the latest it's the greatest sight to see
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp
(Whoa, oh, oh)
Really somethin when they join in jumpin
When they do the Bristol Stomp

It started in Bristol at a dee jay hop
They hollered and whistled
Never wanted to stop
We pony and twisted
And we rocked with Daddy G
The kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol
When they do the Bristol Stomp

75,It Will Stand,"You take some music, music
Sweet flowin' music
A little movin' and groovin'
And rock and roll will stand

You take some heart beats drum beats
Finger poppin' and a-stompin' feet
A little dance that look so neat
You see why it will stand

But, some folks don't understand it
And that's why they don't demand it

It's swept this whole wide land
Rock and roll forever will stand
Alright

Hear those guitars twangin'
Sharp as lightnin'
Hear those drums beat
Louder than thunder

But, forgive them for they know not what they're doin'

But, don't you misname it
In fact you might as well claim it
It's swept this whole wide land
Sinking deep in the heart of man
Come on boy take my hand
Come on boy join in on our plan
Come on boy be a man
'Cause rock and roll will stand

Sinking deep in the heart of man
Come on boy take my hand
Come on boy be a man
'Cause rock and roll will stand

Let's do it all over again
I feel good let's do it again
It'll be here for ever and ever

And you're true to me but still I need more
It would tear me apart to feel no-one ever cared

For me
For me
Me
You are a tower of strength
To me

You stand firm and proud when the wind blows in your face
And when the sun shines in your eyes you just turn your head away

To me

You are a tower of strength

You rescue me, you are my faith, my hope, my liberty
And when there's darkness all around
You shine bright for me, you are a guiding light

And heaven is in your kiss, salvation lies just a touch away

Round a lady bee buzzin'
Just count to ten then count again
There's sure to be an even dozen

They play the same

Now, there was two butterflies castin' their eyes
Both in the same direction
You'd never guess that one little yes
Could start a butterfly collection

Multiplication
That's the name of the game
And each generation
They play the same

Let me tell ya now …I say one and one is five
You can call me a silly goat
But, ya take two minks add two winks
Ahhh ... ya got one mink coat

When a girl gets coy in front of a boy
After three or four dances
Ah … you can just bet she'll play hard to get
To multiply her chances

Multiplication
That's the name of the game
And each generation
You know they play the same

Hear me talkin' to ya …Mother Nature's a clever girl
She relies on habit
Ya take two hares with no cares
Pretty soon you got a room full of rabbits

Parakeets in-between tweets
Sometimes get too quiet
Uh-oh … but, have no fear 'cause soon you'll hear
A parakeet's riot just try it

Halt! Who goes there?

[Narrator: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
Er - a friend

[David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Be on your way. This is my territory

[Narrator: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
Your territory? What do you mean?

[David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Wait a minute - it's you! The man from Maybury Hill!

[Narrator: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
Good heavens! The Artilleryman! I thought you surely burned!

[David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
I thought you surely drowned!

[Narrator: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
Have you seen any Martians?

[David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Everywhere. We're done for all right...

[Narrator: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
We can't just give up!

[David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Course we can't. It's now we've got to start fighting - but not against them 'cos we can't win. Now we've got to fight for survival, and I reckon we can make it. I've got a plan...

[Spoken Intro: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right?
So we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground!
You should see it down there - hundreds of miles of drains - sweet and clean now after the rain!
Dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch!
And what's so bad about living underground eh? It's not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion!

[Verse 1: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show?
But maybe from the madness something beautiful will grow

[Chorus]
In a brave new world
With just a handful of men
We'll start-
We'll start all over again!
All over again!
All over again!
All over again!

[Spoken Interlude 1: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks right under their noses - right under their feet!
Everything we need - banks, prisons and schools... We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and men like you'll teach the kids
Not poems and rubbish - science
So we can get everything working
We'll build villages and towns and... and... we'll play each other at cricket!
Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh? Learn how to make 'em ourselves and then wallop!
Our turn to do some wiping out! Whoosh with our Heat Ray - Whoosh!
And them running and dying, beaten at their own game
Man on top again!

[Verse 2: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Now our domination of the Earth is fading fast
And out of the confusion the chance has come at last
To build a better future from the ashes of the past
In a brave new world

[Chorus]
Give me a handful of men
We'll start all over again

[Verse 3: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Look - Man is born in freedom but he soon becomes a slave
In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave
The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved
In a brave new world

[Chorus]
With just a handful of men
We'll start all over again

[Verse 4: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
I'm not trying to tell you what to be
Oh no, oh no, not me
But if mankind is to survive
The people left alive
They're gonna have to build this world anew!
And it's going to have to start with me and you
Yes!

Instrumental (6:08 - 6:55)

I'm not trying to tell you what to be
Oh no, oh no, not me
But if mankind is to survive
The people left alive
They're gonna have to build this world anew
Yes, and we will have to be the chosen few!

[Verse 5: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies!
And imagine the destruction of all that you despise
Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise
In a brave new world

[Chorus]
With just a handful of men
We'll start all over again

Instrumental (7:43 - 8:36)

[Verse 6: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well
And bid the ageing empire of man a last farewell
It may not sound like Heaven but at least it isn't Hell
It's a brave new world

[Chorus]
With just a handful of men
We'll start-
We'll start all over again!
All over again!
All over again!
All over again!

[Spoken Interlude 2: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
I've got a plan!
Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again - a second chance
We'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays
Nothing can stop men like us
I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look

[Narrator: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
In the cellar was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long, that had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers...

[David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]
It's doing the workin' and the thinkin' that wears a feller out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink eh? Nothing but champagne, now I'm the boss!

[Narrator: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
We drank and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games!
Later, he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night. Red Weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly - and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer...

[Outro: David Essex (""The Artilleryman"")]

I love you, I love you, I love only you
But the one home who's waiting he loves you too
He's worried and he's wondering where can you be

Go on home you don't belong here with me

Go on home you don't belong here with me
Though I want you and I need you desperately
But to hide here in the darkness is as wrong as can be

91,I Told The Brook,"I told the brook that runs down through the valley
A secret my best friend never knew
The brook told the trees and the trees told the breeze
That I was in love with you

The trees told the flowers hiding there by the hilltop
The clouds told the moon that shone above
So angry, yet blue, when they found out that you
And your heart had another love

The brook became angry and changed to a river
Rushing so madly along
The soft summer breeze that played tag with the trees
Became so wild and so strong

The bashful, white flowers hiding there by the hilltop
Grew dark when the rain came pouring down
Their hearts couldn't hide all the tears that were cried
And had carpeted on the ground

The storm passed, gone over, there's sunshine again
The chains that held me are now gone
The trees wave, hello, as I stand here below
And the brook sings the sweetest song

The bashful, white flowers are again by the hilltop
The sun and the moon are still my friends
I promise there'll be no more heartaches for me
Till I fall in love again",Marty Robbins,1961,[94],1
92,Smoky Places,"Meeting in smoky places hiding in shadowy corners
Dancing where no one knows our faces
Sharing love stolen in the night in smoky places

You're paying now for your mistakes

We’re meeting in smoky places hiding in shadowy corners

I can't believe the things I'm seeing
I wonder 'bout some things I've heard

It's sure enough getting worse
Everybody's crying justice
Just as long as it's business first

Get your souvenir

Knock 'em dead

It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief;
All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief

A man will fall (Burning star)

When he shot down the judge's son
Yes, he shot Judge Scofield's son

With the dark of night he left that town
Never to return again
With a one-way ticket at the end of the line
He was told by a stranger man
The Comancheros are takin' this land

Then the Comancheros came a-ridin' through the night
Stealin' and a-killin' takin' ever'thing in sight
Nothin' left behind but the blood and the sand
The Comancheros are takin' this land
The Comancheros are takin' this land

I'll cover every inch of the ground where I stand
I'd die before I'd run
I'm not afraid of any living man
And here I'll make my stand
With a gun I'll make my stand

He rode into the Comanchero town
Like a wild man on the run
Before he'd leave they'd all be dead
They'd die by his blazin' gun
They died by his blazin' gun

I go to war, like a fool
My cells are shaped, like a moon
All I can do is cry
Can I really sing?
I'm standing three steps from the altar

This time, I'm not gonna let another day go by

Without treating you so right
This time, I'm not gonna let go of your love
This time, I promise you that we'll rise above it all
And I will never let you fall
I'm gonna give you my all, this time
Oh, I never thought that I was hurting you
Now I know that I was wrong, now I know just what to do

I've sailed along the rivers of Peru
I've seen the world and all its Seven Wonders
But I've never seen a wonder like you

I've stood upon the pyramids of Egypt
Far away across the ocean blue
I've seen the island beauties of Hawaii
But I've never seen a beauty like you

I've gazed at the White Cliffs Of Dover
There's not a place I didn't see
Now that my travels are over
I wish you had been there with me

I've seen the pretty dancing girls of Siam
The happy Polynesian people, too
But they're not as happy as I am
'cause they haven't got a wonder like you

115,Foot Stomping - Part 1,"Chorus:

All they wanna do is see my people round up
But we had to build foundation from the ground up
Front to back and side to side, they're all around us
Intimidated, so you know they wanna hound us

Verse 1:

Hope you're ready when it's war time, revolution on the screen
Everybody watching hunger games, its exactly what it seems
People ask where's the mountaintop and how long we posed to be climbing
Y'all finished or done with that cooning, to many people are blinded
Blindsided poppin bottles, by fake butts on them models
I'm trying to move my people forward, my foot stomping on the throttle
Police shooting like the splash brothers, and these judges ain't reffing the game
So eventually what its might meant to be is my people should just cock back and aim
Rearrange the game, simple and plain
Got a mind full of ammo with a tool on my waist, ok
They act like our mothers got kids to replace
They're shooting them too or just take them away
What you really think supposed to happen now, much more than marching and praying, we militant

Chorus:

All they wanna do is see my people round up
But we had to build foundation from the ground up
Front to back and side to side, they're all around us
Intimidated, so you know they wanna hound us


Verse 2:

How many times you been hit with that (ooooooooop)
And think to yourself the outcomes the same if youre lying or telling the truth
All of my hittas on the selling block, what prison is paying the most
On a hustle for our daily bread while the the heat is burning the toast, look
All of our rights are wronged, all tje OG's are gone
In this fight trying to keep it all together, so the whole team is strong
I'm the glue blowing glue out of 82's to maintain my sanity
How you not down to fight for yours, thats not a man to me
Got a team full of Nate Turners with a few burners plus we move as a unit
Each of us is anothers crutch,  so you can't penetrate through it
Been had a plan and we're going to execute it, A soldier you doing just part of your duty
Standing up salute the whole squadron like absolutely
We Militant",Konshens TheMC,1961,"[45, 34, 35, 32, 38, 30, 25, 28, 32, 37, 50, 58, 74, 94, 100]",15

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile
Here's your friendly announcer

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

119,Sometime,"[Verse 1]
I bet you thought your life would change
But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends
I pretend

I always wanna die, sometimes

And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die

Am I me through geography?
A face collapsed through entropy

How can I write on paper, what I'm feeling deep inside
Words to you would last no longer, then it take tear to dry
A love as sweet as your and mine, deserve another start
How can I write on paper what I feel in my heart?

Those simple things you gave are worth the world to me
And each up when I cling to you can take memories
So many things were left unsaid, I don't know where to start
How can I write on paper what I feel in my heart?

Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-Illitant
Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern
That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't as dope, was it?
I'm cold buzzin', I never been low budget
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
I break free like Chesimard
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars is like ASMR
All my dogs is out the reservoir
Top five, I'm where the legends are (Keep goin')
Live at the edge of darkness and light
One phone call, my youngins takin' flight
You a bark bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
If you ain't standin' up for yourself, then stay seated
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo Vespucci
I'm a miracle, I'm still super lyrical
Live from the Terrordome, loud like a megaphone
Thutmose the Third with seven inch herringbones

[Chorus: Q-Tip, Royce da 5'9"" & dEnAun]
Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh-huh, I survived it and that's a miracle, ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
Like Ice Cube said, ""Before you wreck yourself"" (Bitches)
Like Wu-Tang said, ""You should protect yourself"" (Animals)
I got 'em goin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Better hope an ambulance is en route
Papers are hand grenades soon as I pull the pin out
I am the Santa Fe, Mandalay and Orlando and Colorado and Columbine
All combined into one, I don't walk a line, bitch, I run
'Cause we don't got no time to waste, so come on Denaun
Here come me, 5-to-9 and Thought, da-dun, da-dun
Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em
Leave these pussies stretched out like the Octomom
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause you put it up in the sky
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you're like a vagina problem
To a diabolical gynecologist tryna ball a fist, I will
Fuck you, just buy me, double timing the rhyming
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019
I'm a conniving, when I'm on the mic I'ma standout
Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
Me and this game, we got married already
Had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
She barely was three months pregnant
Bitch had it, gave me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly
Now here's to LL, Big L and Del
K-Solo, Treach, and G Rap
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
Ed O.G. , and EPMD, D.O.C., Ice-T, Evil Dee
King Tee, UTFO, and Schoolly D, PE, and BDP
YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy
From B.I.G. and Paris, Three Times Dope, and some we'll never see, and PRT
N.W.A and Eazy-E, and D-R-E was like my GPS
Without him, I don't know where I'd be

130,I Cried My Last Tear,"When you left me lonely here
I thought that I would drown in tears
As one was wiped away
Another one would take its place
Drop by drop, as time went by
I slowly ran that river dry
Until I finally realized today

That I've cried my last tear for you
Wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
It's been raining pain since you walked out
But, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I've cried my last tear for you

Well, I used to lay alone in bed
With my pillow soaking wet
And all of those lonely nights
I thought there was no end in sight
I cried my heart out over you
But then I cried the hurt out too
It took a while, but now I'll be alright

But I've cried my last tear for you
Wasted my last year on you
There's no trace of the heartache I knew
Well, it's been raining pain since you walked out
But, baby, that's all over now
'Cause I've cried my last tear for you
Yes, baby, I've cried my last tear for you",Ricky Van Shelton,1961,"[69, 72, 82, 87, 93]",5

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow

And when you come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me

And all my grave shall warmer, sweeter be

What lonliness can do
Since I've been away
I have loved you more each day

Walking back to happiness I shared with you

I'm making up everything you said
And mistakes to which they lead
I shouldn't have gone away
So I'm coming back today

Walking back to happiness I threw away
Walking back to happiness with you
Said farewell to loneliness I knew

Played aside foolish pride
Learnt the truth from tears I cried
Spread the news I'm on my way
All my blues have blown away

I'm bringing you love so true
Cause that's what I owe to you

143,The Way I Am,"[Segue from ""Steve Berman (Skit)""]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

145,On Bended Knees,"When I first met the Saviour, I was blind to all my sin
Letting part of it go had kept me satisfied
But I didn't think a Christian could wind up in this place
Now I'm sure I'm one of those for whom you died

Wash away all that remains
Once and for all, remove the stains of the sins that had been steeped below the surface of my veins

What a wondrous thing you do, Lord, when I fall on my knees
How the mercy follows through, Lord, when I fall on my knees
'Til there's nothing left but you, Lord, when I fall on my knees
I will please your heart on bended knees, on bended knees

Though the world can have its heyday, pointing fingers at your kids, let us not return the evil that they pay
For you have chosen people who are flawed in many ways, who will demonstrate your love in action, not in words they say

Wipe away all of our tears
Once and for all, remove the fears of the children you have raised in the midst of mocking peers

What a wondrous thing you do, Lord, when I fall on my knees
How the mercy follows through, Lord, when I fall on my knees
'Til there's nothing left but you, Lord, when I fall on my knees
I will please your heart on bended knees, on bended knees

I come to you on bended knees to humbly seek your face
Repenting now, I long to bear the fruit of righteousness, the fruit of righteousness

What a wondrous thing you do, Lord, when I fall on my knees
How the mercy follows through, Lord, when I fall on my knees
'Til there's nothing left but you, Lord, when I fall on my knees
I will please your heart.... I will please your heart on bended knees

It's just to you my heart I give
I'll always be your slave my darling
Through the coming years
There were sometimes whe I was doubtful
Of this new love affair
But now my mind is no more doubtful
I've found my heaven with the help of a prayer
You are the song within my soul

147,The Bridge Of Love,"Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
When the bridge of love starts falling down falling down falling down
The bridge is strong but when things go wrong it's down down down

Watch the happy children go round and round some are black some are brown
The bridge is strong but when things go wrong it's down down down
Hear the little children singing their song everything's right and they belong
All the little children are gonna be sad when the bridge falls down no mom no dad
When the bridge of love starts falling down...

One hand a reachin' out to another makes a bridge of love will you be my brother
The bridge is strong but when things go wrong it's down down down
Look at our country what do you see the bridge of all colors standing free
The bridge is strong but when hearts go wrong it's down down down

When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me, but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely; never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose

Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone

Cut me down to size
So I can fit inside

I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's bright and gay

I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

Your kiss will always thrill me

In the same old way
Your touch will mean as much

Tomorrow as it does today

So don't worry, baby
Whatever you do
'Cause I'll never stop wanting you

Your kiss will always thrill me
In the same old way
Your touch will mean as much

No, I'll never stop wanting you",Brian Hyland,1961,[83],1
152,I Wonder (If Your Love Will Ever Belong To Me),"Fall in love, such sweet sorrow
Here's a little something from me
You know there’s an old saying
If you love something, set it free
If it doesn’t comes back, HUNT IT DOWN AND KILL IT!!!

[Verse 1 Steaknife]
Ever since I seen you fucking my brother
I can't have a normal conversation with my mother
I wonder if your silly lies disguised by your bedroom eyes
Are these phony alibis loss and cries
Cross my heart I hope you die I love you ...(die) forever
From credit cards to diamond rings I just about giving you everything
And now I'm screaming smashing my head into seizures
Killing memories and cease activities of leizure
And thoughts to dedication how stupid, I gave you through scriptures
And now I'm watching blood drip off me slowly
Onto your pictures think about how much you owe me
Sneaky little bitch you can't love me and leave me lonely
I know you care I'm aware deep down inside
I'm coming back for you baby and everything'll be a'ight

[Steaknife](Cathy Swane) Spoken Simaltaneously
(Stop, I mean it! If you don't) What? What?
(I don't know what I'm gonnna do!) Shut the fuck up!
(Leave me alone) I swear to God I'm gonna kill you right fucking now!
(I mean it. Please baby leave me alone!)
You owe me for every little fucking sperm that's in your mouth
(Please!) or in your fucking gut I want it back NOW!

I followed you to work
I followed you to school
I followed you home
Looked in your window
Saw you nude
I noticed right away
That you had rearranged the room
I love the things you do
You don't have a clue

[Verse 2 Brooks Buford]
I oughta crack your damn trachea for squeezing in my life (Why are you not taking your medication?)
Playing wife, stabbed in my back with your diamond studded Rambo knife
What about the evil that women do?
If I’m beating on a female best believe I got a reason to
So call Oprah while I’m home playing husband
My girl’s fucking my cousin so now I'm back on angel dust
And busting out her face 4 in the morning
Dragging wifey cross the asphalt heard she was ho-ing
It isn't my fault love is an illusion
Ain't nobody down for you except God
Never put your faith in humans
I'm up in Georgia Mental Health
With pictures of my boo’s who out there, fucking you
Talking about the evil that Brooks do
It’s tragic, now I got a $100 medication habit laughing
Sucking on pills, thinking about river rafting
I love you baby. Why don't you come visit me this Saturday?
We'll walk around the yard I'll slice your throat and plead insanity, sweetie (Fucking wacko)

I followed you to work
I followed you to school
I followed you home
Looked in your window
Saw you nude
I noticed right away
That you had rearranged the room
I love the things you do
You don't have a clue

[Verse 3 Danny]
I rethink it over and over, stabbing pain in the abdomen
Abandoned, betrayal is the sick sorry, psychotic
Bitch hypnotic with the eroticism, possessed
And I'm obsessed with her slutty ass
So what I cracked her rib and blacked her eye?
She lies a lot best thing that ever happened to me
Pushing me to the edge holding a butcher knife to the trachea
Of my once future wife she's a maniac for making me react
This brutally I yearn to watch her gurgle on her plasma
And lay six feet beneath a slab of marble left her in tears simultaneous
You better watch your back, bitch, Lover boy’s watching, waiting
Contemplating, your final inhalation of oxygen
You will catch a chill I'm ill I no longer care
Consequence is the least of my fears
Answer your phone and let the beast you created whisper inside your ear
""You belong to me, dearie"" (Fucking Freak) When you're asleep
Do your floors creak? Do you remember me? IS THIS YOUR SPARE KEY?

I followed you to work
I followed you to school
I followed you home
Looked in your window
Saw you nude

That you had rearranged the room

Let me tell you all about...

We're just hanging out
We can talk about it

[Verse 2:]
You said that's cool, but not for you
And you walked away
I tried my best, I gave my all
What else could I say?
As you crossed the street
By chance you meet an angel in disguise
Supernatural meeting of modern times
She knew

Every little thing that just occurred
Every little way you've been disturbed
Every little thing that has been wrong
Faith in God has kept her strong
Just take a step

161,What A Party,"Where was Jodie when the lights went out?
Standing in the corner shouting ""Shout, sister, shout!""

What a party! Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could wail away!)
What a party! Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat guy, oh man, he sure could play!)

The girl wore a dress with no shoes on
The big tenor man really blew his horn

What a party! Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat guy, oh man he sure could wail away!)
What a party! Lordy, Lordy!

Somebody called a cop about half past four
He really just couldn't get through that door

-peak Billboard position #8 in 1952
-Words by Sammy Gallop and Music by Kurt Adams

I used to walk with you
Along the avenue
Our hearts were carefree and gay
How could I know I'd lose you
Somewhere along the way?

The friends we used to know
Would always smile ""Hello""
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way

I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way

I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you

Traumatized
You can see the pain when you look in my eyes
Butterflies
Inside my stomach but they probably died
It's my time to bloom
But all my emotions and happenings lead me to doom
Don’t know what to do
Just wish I could live in the moments that I spent with you

[Verse 1]
Leave me out
In the cold and sleet
Now my heart is froze
And it's hard to breathe
I don't wanna live
I don’t wanna be
In so much pain and so much grief
Hold me back when I'm on the edge
When I wish it was me and not you that was dead
All regret
And I'm so upset
Lookin' at all your messages I left on read
Cut me up
Throw me in the trash
I won't fit in a coffin or a body bag
Times are good and then they jump to bad
So I live in the bestest of moments we had (One, two)

Wish we could make one more song
I'll be there, bro, it won't be long
Imma do what you'd want me to do, rip my bong

Fought so hard I've seen my goal

178,Hollywood,"[Intro]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go

179,The Mountain's High,"They drove me to the other side
Off the airport, it's dead or alive
As light dribbles down

The mist around the plane
I guess once they take me from here
I'll never return again

What is the crime?
Just like you, I'm a victim of time
It's the child in his eyes
Always makes me cry
And I said to myself
I will rise to the highest high

And we're all staying a lie

Came by today
As he was telling everyone in town
Of all the love that he'd just found

And marie's the name (of his latest flame)

Talked and talked
And i heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
Prettiest green eyes anywhere

And marie's the name (of his latest flame)

The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed
His money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine

She is famous
She is funny
An engagement ring
Doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh

The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)

If i jumped from the top of the parachutes ?""

That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, plastic head
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need an Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, ""What up?"" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

A pretty girl is like a melody
That haunts you night and day
Just like the strain

She think a nigga fuckin' groupies, I'm just grindin' hard
Your family said we wouldn't last, but we beat the odds
Bonnie and Clyde, she was with a nigga stealin' cars
These streets so dirty, I just want someone who really there
Can't fake love, I just want someone who really care
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share
Open your eyes, baby girl, real niggas rare

188,It's Your World,"[Verse 1]
Night blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Trippin' on heights, wishin' for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies
Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they on
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good workin' with my hands
My generation never understood workin' for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

[Hook]
It's your world

[Verse 2]
Life and death flow around us
Four pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike
She got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world

And you read old love letters
Drowning in the sea
Oh baby it doesn't matter
Oh you've lost all what you feel
Can you feel my heart?
Baby don't give up
Can you feel my love tonight?
In 100 years, love is illegal
In 100 years from now
In 100 years, love is illegal
In this lonely, heartbreak town
In 100 years, love is illegal
All your dreams will die
In 100 years, love is illegal
And your hope will not survive
L O V E, love is illegal in my heart
Can you hear my heart is beating?
L O V E, love is illegal in my heart
Can you hear my heart is beating?
Love is blind",Modern Talking,1961,"[91, 91, 93, 99]",4

I know you work in the morning
But tonight girl we should stay up just because
Pop some champagne in the tub just because

[Verse 1]
I said when's the last time we made love just because?
Just cause we ain't got shit to do
Lately you been so predictable
I just need, I just need someone to listen to
Damnit, I miss when you strip for no reason
I mean just for no reason
Shopping and buying me gifts for no reason
Now all you do is throw fists for no reason
That shit's so depressing, I miss how it used to be
Now you just got used to me
Used to how usually you get when I'm in your space
Now it don't feel like our vibe is the same
I think we so routine, it's disgustin'
Lately girl, we been so structured
I mean how can we be so reluctant
I just want the same person I fell in love with

[Chorus]
Cause when's the last time that you called just because?
Say hello just because?
When's the last time we got drunk just because?
When's the last time that we fucked just because?
I promise I won't change us just because
Let's be real just because
Chef up a meal in yo heels just because
Throw on some Netflix and chill just because
Tell me when's the last time we went out just because?
Left the house just because?
When's the last time I went down just because?
When's the last time you got loud just because?
Tell me when's last time I said I'm proud just because?
Make you smile just because?
Act like some kids and play house just because
Throw on some jams and get loud just because

[Verse 2]
Just cause you're special, don't let your job get the best of you
That's when you get the best of me
I feel we ain't been connecting mentally
I hope that you don't think any less of me
Dammit, I miss when you strip for no reason (just because)
I mean just for no reason
Showers at night, candles lit on some sweet shit
Now all we do is throw fists for no reason
That shit's so depressing, I blame myself, maybe it's my fault
Fuck it girl, just take your top off
That make up sex, wake up next morning and hop on that spaceship
Cruise all of the places that got lost in translation
Let's take your mind off it
Lately girl we been so structured
I'm so in love, I just need you to trust it
You just want the same person you fell in love with

[Chorus]
Cause when's the last time that I called just because?
And said hello just because?
When's the last time we got drunk just because?
When's the last time that we fucked just because?
I promise I won't change up just because
You know I work in the morning
But tonight girl, we should stay up just because
Pop some champagne in the tub just because
Hold up, when's the last time we went out just because?
Left the house just because?
When's the last time I went down just because?
When's the last time you got loud just because?
Baby, when's the last time I, hehe (just because)
Make you smile, just because

Throw on some jams and get down just because
Just cause, I love you

[Interlude]
Hey, um, it's me again

Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace

[Brief Message]
Hey baby, this is Grandma
I just called to check in on you, make sure everything is okay
I haven't heard from you, give Grandma a call back, I love you",Joyner Lucas,1961,[99],1
192,It's Just A House Without You,"Cause you see
I'm going home to no one
I'm going home alone

It was fun to be fancy free
But now my loneliness
Shows through, I miss you

What's the good in crying
I'm only wasting tears
What can I say, what can I do
It's just a house without you

We planned a home
High on a hill
Til I had the urge to roam
But now I found
No peace of mind
I can't seem to live alone

I think I'm gonna stop this crying
Yeah, I'm only wasting tears
What can I say, what can I do
It's a house without you
Just a house without you

Now we planned a home
High up on a hill
Til I had the urge to roam
But now I found
No peace of mind
I can't seem to live alone

Lord, I got to stop this crying
Cause I'm only wasting tears
Why should I fret
And go and grab a jet
Cause what am I rushing to

It's just a hole in
The wall without you
It ain't nothing there without you
It's like zero without you
Baby, ain't nothing there without you",Brook Benton,1961,"[51, 45, 52, 60, 76]",5
193,(He's) The Great Impostor,"Well, I went and lost her
To the great imposter
I stood and watched her fall
Couldn't help her at all

Poetry, so sweet, has her at his feet
She thinks she's the one but he has just begun
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter

Don't she know he's on a stage
It's not real, it's just a play
And he's playing a part
That is soon to break her heart

Oh, can't she see tomorrow's misery?
Soon she'll learn her fate but it will be too late
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter

Poetry, so sweet, has her at his feet
She thinks she's the one but he has just begun
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter

And she's soon to join the roster
For they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster
For they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster",The Fleetwoods,1961,"[57, 35, 30, 38, 39, 47, 79, 93]",8
194,One Track Mind,"[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Love is like problems, we all got 'em

[Verse 1: Jared Leto]
A dark night, remember, the sunrise, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Hands tied, remember, it's suicide to surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, I have a one track-mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

[Verse 2: Jared Leto]
Sex and lies, remember, look in my eyes, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Outta luck, outta time, outta sight, I'm outta mind, mind

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, I have a one-track mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Float around town, made it official now
Think about you every now and again
There's been times, spendin days when I'm with you, girl
On my downtime, locking in, I take a ride around downtown
I'm not in the right town, come alive in the nighttime
Wasn't the right state, wasn't the right mind
Love is like problems, we all got 'em
How come when you stop a problem
Everybody problems become your problem?
Let 'em cry 'bout it, ain't my problem
Ain't my fault, Mystikal, Silkk the Shocker
Heard it's only thirty seconds to Mars
And it took you even less just to get to my heart

[Outro: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, method to the madness
One track-mind, method to the madness
One track-mind, method to the madness

[Intro: Big Sean]
Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history

197,Without You,"[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you

199,Don't Get Around Much Anymore,"[Verse 1]
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

[Verse 2]
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
I couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

[Bridge]
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories?

[Verse 3]
Been invited on dates
Might have gone, but what for?
I couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

[Outro]
Don't get around much anymore",Duke Ellington,1961,"[78, 74, 61, 57, 58, 61, 57, 71, 78]",9
200,Don't Cry No More,"Don't cry no more, wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more, baby, wipe away your tears
And I know, I know that your love is real
Don't cry, don't cry, I'm begging you
Don't cry no more, baby, I'm begging you
Every tear you shed tells me that your love is true
You cried me a river, you cried me a sea
Now I believe without a doubt
That you really, really, really love me
You cried me a river, you cried me a sea
Now I believe without a doubt
That you really, really, really love me
Don't cry no more, wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more, baby, wipe away your tears
And I know, I know that your love is real
I don't want you to cry, no, I don't want you to cry
It's summertime and the living is easy
I don't want you to cry, no, please don't cry",Bobby “Blue” Bland,1961,"[83, 78, 82, 71, 79, 80, 89]",7
201,Tonight I Won't Be There,"[Verse 1]
I see you looking over here
Girl you don't belong over there
And you’re too pretty with the bright eyes
Time to move on from the night sky
So sorry I had to change you
So sorry I shouldn't blame you
Atari the way I play you
No feelings that's what the fame do
I can make you feel alright tonight
But I won’t be there in the morning got a flight
I can make you feel alright tonight
But I won't be there in the morning got a flight

[Chorus]
I won't let my guard down ever again
You can call me yours but I'm playing pretend
I ain't getting hurt or caught up in a heartbreak
If I wanna live I gotta do it my way
I won't let my guard down ever again
You can call me yours but I'm playing pretend
I ain't getting hurt or caught up in a heartbreak
If I wanna live i gotta do it my way

[Verse 2]
You gonna hate me when i break it to you
Every little thing i end up taking from you
You can survive on your own
When I’m out on the road everybody wanna know
Who hurt me
She dead in my head
I forgot her name
And so did my friends
Told me she would stay
Then bounced off again
But i was always better
Than the one coming next
Now you miss me
But you threw me in the deep end
Oh yeah she blowing up my phone
On the weekend
Oh yeah forgot about the times
That we spent
Erasing everything
I know you’re still creeping

[Pre-Chorus]
(On me
But I changed
You did too
But I'ma take
The fucking blame
On me
Damaging my brain
Numbing all my senses
Tryna rid of all the pain)

On me
But I changed
You did too
But I’ma take
The fucking blame
On me
Damaging my brain
Numbing all my senses
Tryna rid of all the pain

[Chorus]
I won't let my guard down ever again
You can call me yours but I'm playing pretend
I ain't getting hurt or caught up in a heartbreak
If i wanna live i gotta do it my way
I won’t let my guard down ever again
You can call me yours but I'm playing pretend
I ain't getting hurt or caught up in a heartbreak
If i wanna live i gotta do it my way
I won't let my guard down ever again
You can call me yours but I'm playing pretend
I ain't getting hurt or caught up in a heartbreak
If i wanna live i gotta do it my way",​guccihighwaters,1961,"[85, 61, 71, 83, 91, 84, 76]",7
202,Backtrack,"I can't go along with it, you can say just what you like
But you still did it, you backtrack and change your act
At a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am, I won't go along with it

Am I confused, am I a crazy person, you say it's old news
She doesn't mean nothing but don't you understand
That I am heartbroken, no matter what you do
You just can't make it untrue

You're breathing lies I want to believe in
When I'm watching you walk out the door, I could fall through the floor

But I can't go along with it, you can say just what you like
But you still did it, you backtrack and change your act
At a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am, I won't go along with it

Too much to lose and it's still raining, I know it's not a game
So I'll stop playing, but oh my heart's on fire
And it keeps burning and I don't mean to cry
It's just the smoke gets in my eyes

You're breathing lies I want to believe in
When I'm watching you walk out the door, I could fall through the floor

But I can't go along with it, you can say just what you like
But you still did it, you backtrack and change your act
At a hundred lies a minute
But fool as I am, I won't go along with it

Let the battle drum start, I wanna turn back the clock
I wanna find the missing pieces of the whole love I lost
You say it like you mean it and I want to believe it
Cause I can't stop this feeling

But I can't go along with it, you can say just what you like
But you still did it, you backtrack and change your act

203,Why Not Now,"[Verse 1]
You take it nice and easy
You play it safe 'cause that's what people do today
I guess that's ok
Girl somewhere in your mind
There must be a perfect time to fall in love
But baby I'm burning up

[Chorus]
So why not now, why not here
Darling my heart just ain't too clear
Oh what are we waitin' for
'Cause I've never been so sure
Why not you, why not me
Living like we were meant to be
Together, forever
Why not now

[Verse 2]
Right here in this moment
We could start a love to stand the test of time
Baby you know that's right
No one knows tomorrow
The morning sun could rise and take our chance away
Long gone with yesterday, so

Who put the dip in the dip da dip da dip?

Who was that man? I'd like to shake his hand
He made my baby fall in love with me

She said we'd never have to part

They say heaven's a place
Yeah, heaven's a place and they know where it is
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
And when they hear the beat, coming from the street, they lock the door
But if there's no music up in heaven, then what's it for?
When I hear the beat, the spirit's on me like a live-wire
A thousand horses running wild in a city on fire
It starts in your feet, then it goes to your head
And if you can't feel it, then the rules are dead
And if you're the judge, what is our crime?

Then you grow up
Unafraid of the dark
So, darling, when I kiss you
And your heart goes in a spin
Don't be afraid
Let true love begin
Oh, when you're alone
You're afraid that it's true
Love won't come
It won't hapoen to you
So to let this chance
For happiness go by
Would be a sin
Don't be afraid
Let true love begin
I know the feeling
That you're feeling is new
And your heart still
Wants to hide
This feeling that
Sends you reeling
I'm feeling too
It's love, it cannot be denied
So take my hand
I'll always be at your side
There's no need
For you to hide
So listen to your heart that's
Telling you from deep within

And while they're down there working
They won't be all alone
They'll run into another group that's even hot back home
They asked me how I knew
Our career was through

I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied

Next we have the Four Freshmen

Is there no one place

I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long

Hang 'em from a tall oak tree
Eliminate the Kingston Trio
More money for you and me
Dion and the Belmonts
Are driving us to tears
Let's send them up the river
For about a hundred years
While the kids are watching Dion singing about the stars
The Belmonts are out in the parking lot stealing hubcaps off
Of cars
Each time I steal a hubcap
It almost breaks my heart
Why do I steal a hubcap
Why do I have to start
Each night I ask the stars without fail
Why must I be a teenager in jail?

We really do not know

I never counted on you making me blue
They say your a running 'round with somebody new
Who can I count on, if I can't count on you?
I thought I held a precious key to Heaven
Your love was sweet and gentle at the start
But now I feel that I can't go on living
If living means that we must live apart

¿2015?
Sí

[Verso]
He hecho cosas buenas de las que ahora me arrepiento
No se aprenden en la escuela, eso lo enseña el tiempo
También hice muchas malas pero no las cuento
Estoy bien en la calle, coño, no quiero ir pa' dentro
Las cadenas van por fuera, las penas por dentro
Tengo mil problemas pero intento estar contento
El tonto el culo con el Mini se pone a doscientos
Y yo quiero un Lamborghini pa' pasear lento
Me dicen ''flaco estás pegao', suenas por el centro''
Y contesto ''yo no estoy pegao', yo soy pegamento''
Yo soy Pimp Flaco, hermano, no rapero del momento
Yo soy Pimp Flaco, coño, ¿te lo explico o te lo cuento?
Mira, como mucho llevo un par de años en esto
Y con la tontería creo que me he ganao' el puesto
Que tú critiques lo que hago yo lo veo perfecto
Pero también te digo que aquí nadie vuela recto
''Eh Flaco que tú no eres un gángster, parguela
Que tú lo que eres es un feca''
Si yo nunca he dicho que yo sea un gángster, hermano, al menos que yo sepa
Si estás to' picao' marica pues coge y te rascas donde más te pica
Y pregúntate por qué cojones tus putas canciones no tienen visitas
Que vivís en la peli de gente muy mala, de chungos y de narcos violentos
Os dejo la peli pa' todos vosotros que yo quiero vivir del cuento
Estoy esperando que llegue el momento
Si te jode, mamona, lo siento
Que tú puedes decir que yo soy un flipao' pero yo por lo menos lo intento

Me ofrecen ofertas y tantos por ciento y son tantos que no me concentro
Nos ven en la rampa y que estamos subiendo y to' eso les come por dentro

When things were going right
But I want to tell you just before I go
That I pray your heart will never ever know

What went wrong, I’ll never know

You tried to explain it, oh, let me down slow
How I wish I could change it
I can’t help it, these feelings... just won’t let go
When the night closes in
And the heartache begins
Just remember, I’m only guilty
Of loving you...
I wish the rain would go away, from outside my window
Each passing day reminds me, of how much I miss you
Since you said you were leaving
Hmm, I’m so empty inside
I refuse to believe it. If only we could be together again
When the night closes in
And the heartache begins
Just remember, I’m only guilty
Of loving you...
Solo...
When the night closes in
And the heartache begins
Just remember, I’m only guilty
Of loving you... oh, baby

Of loving you...

222,A Little Bit Of Soap,"A little bit of soap will wash
Away the lipstick from my face
A little bit of soap will never
Never, never, ever erase
The pain in my heart and my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap will wash
Away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap will never
Never, never, ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Have you heard
When love begins to die
It leaves someone to cry
Night and day
Like a bird, you left your
Robin's nest and just like
All the rest, you flew away
Mmm, a little bit of soap will
Take away your perfume eventually
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will
Never wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will
Never wash away my tears",Garnet Mimms,1961,"[61, 40, 27, 12, 19, 24, 35, 48, 67, 89]",10
223,Hurt,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away

224,Wooden Heart,"We’re all born to broken people on their most honest day of living
And since that first breath, we’ll need grace that we’ve never given (well)
Well, I've been haunted by standard red devils and white ghosts
It's not only when these eyes are closed
These lies are ropes that I tie down in my stomach
But they hold this ship together, tossed like leaves in this weather
My dreams are sails that I point towards my true north
Stretched thin over my rib bones, and pray that it gets better
But it won’t, at least I don’t believe it will...

So I've built a wooden heart inside this iron ship
To sail these blood red seas and find your coasts
Don’t let these waves wash away your hopes
This war-ship is sinking, and I still believe in anchors
Pulling fist fulls of rotten wood from my heart, oh
I still believe in saviors
Because we are all made out of shipwrecks, every single board
Washed and bound like crooked teeth on these rocky shores
So come on and let’s wash each other
With tears of joy and tears of grief
And fold our lives like crashing waves and run up on this beach
Come on and sew us together
Just some tattered rags stained forever
We only have what we remember

I am the barely-living son of a woman and man who barely made it
But we’re making it
Taped together on borrowed crutches and new starts
We all have the same holes in our hearts
Everything falls apart at the exact same time
It all comes together perfectly for the next step
But my fear is this prison that I keep locked below the main deck
I keep a key under my pillow, it’s quiet and it’s hidden
And my hopes are weapons that I’m still learning how to use right
But they’re heavy and I’m awkward, I'm always running out of fight

So I’ve carved a wooden heart, put it in this sinking ship
Hoping it would help me float for just a few more weeks
But I am all made out of shipwrecks, every twisted beam
Lost and found like you and me, all scattered out on the seas
So come on, let’s wash each other
With tears of joy and tears of grief
And fold our lives like crashing waves and run up on this beach
Come on and sew us together
We're just some tattered rags stained forever
We only have what we remember

My throat, it still tastes like house fire and salt water
I wear this tide like loose skin, come on and rock me to sea
If we hold on tight, we’ll hold each other together
And not just be some fools rushing to die in our sleep
While these machines will rust, I promise
But we'll still be electric, shocking each other back to life
Your hand in mine, my fingers and your veins connected
Our bones grown together in time
Our hands entwined, and my fingers and your veins connected
Our spines grown stronger inside
'Cause I know that our church is all made out of shipwrecks
From every hull these rocks have claimed
But we pick ourselves up
And try and grow better through this change
So come on and let’s wash each other
With tears of joy and tears of grief
And fold our lives like crashing waves and run up on this beach
Come on and sew us together
We're just some tattered rags stained forever
We only have what we remember",Listener,1961,"[63, 37, 23, 8, 6, 2, 1, 2, 5, 9, 13, 18, 35, 55, 69, 98]",16

After tossing and turning
And yearning the whole night long

And wondering just what went wrong
Pretty baby, I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue?

I need your arms to hold me tight!
I need your lips to kiss me goodnight!
I'm so unhappy on my own...
Don't, don't, leave me sad and lonely

I wake up crying
After tossing and turning
And yearning the whole night long
Pretty baby, please come back to me
Save me from this misery...

I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man

Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay your legs like a store they open up
And you got people in line
Been here every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you
Just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
The type of thing I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a rebel, go a second and a third time
Left you a perverse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate  yah third eye

Your clothes off, turn around, let me see

Yeah, okay I came up with a plan, it was take you by the hand
And bring you somewhere where the sand is
Soon as we landed
We went straight into the room
And played the music, started dancing
You was taking off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore
I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we moved it to the floor
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doing everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right
Yeah, but I still respect the game
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight
The sex is great, for Heaven's sake I need it every day

To shoot her man if he was doing' her wrong

There was her loving Johnny

233,Riders In The Sky,"[Verse 1]
An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy drawl

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 2]
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire as they ride on, hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell from ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies""

You started sayin' things that I've had trouble gettin' over

I got 20 feet of rope, but I got nowhere to tie it
To climb out of this hole or pull myself any higher
'Cause I'm exhausted and my bones are heavy, coated with iron
Forged in a fire and molded with pliers
I know that I'm supposed to be the one who's givin' hope, I'm a liar

But all it did was make a spark, it didn't power the tires
It's like I'm standin' on the edge and I'm scared
I wonder if I slip 'n fall would anyone care
I did my best to fix it but it can't be repaired
And it ain't fair

I feel like I've been livin' on the dark side
I know it's hard to tell but I've been goin' through a hard time
Fightin' in a blindfold with my ankles and my arms tied
I'm runnin' out of places where the bruises and the scars hide
Honestly I'm angry and exhausted
I'm appalled at what the therapy and medicine have cost
And I'm so tortured by the feeling's that they told me they could cure
I'm runnin' out of options, that's for sure
I don't want the sympathy or sorries, I'm not in it for the glory
Bein' popular is boring, I just want to tell my story
All that sappy shit is corny, I won't make it 'til I'm 40
With the way that I've been feelin' I might go before the morning
And when I leave I will not reappear
No encore, even if you stay to scream and cheer
I just hope I help you see it clear
'Cause now we're here

[Chorus]
They say keep hangin' on (Say keep hangin' on)
There ain't shit to hold on to (To hold on, too)
I used to be strong (Used to be strong)
After all that I've gone through (All that I've gone through)
I don't feel like myself (I don't feel like myself), and I think I need help
The people I talk to (People I talk to)
Say keep hangin' on (Keep hangin' on)

237,Image - Part 1,"I find it a little difficult to say what the subject matter of this seminar is going to be, because it's too fundamental to give it a title. I'm going to talk about what there is. Now, the first thing though, that we have to do, is to get our perspectives with some background about the basic ideas that, as Westerners living today in the United States, influence our everyday common sense - our fundamental notions about what life is about. And there are historical origins for this, which influence us more strongly than most people realize. Ideas of the world which are built into the very nature of the language we use, and of our ideas of logic, and of what makes sense altogether.

And these basic ideas I call myth, not using the word ""myth"" to mean simply something untrue, but to use the word ""myth"" in a more powerful sense. A myth is an image in terms of which we try to make sense of the world. And we at present are living under the influence of two very powerful images. Which are, in the present state of scientific knowledge, inadequate. And one of our major problems today is to find an adequate, satisfying image of the world. Well that's what I'm going to talk about. And I'm going to go further than that, not only what image of the world to have, but how we can get our sensations and our feelings in accordance with the most sensible image of the world that we can manage to conceive.

Alright, now - the two images which we have been working under for two-thousand years and maybe more, are what I would call two models of the universe, and the first is called the ceramic model, and the second, the fully automatic model. The ceramic model of the universe is based on the book of Genesis, from which Judaism, Islam, and Christianity derive their basic picture of the world. And the image of the world in the book of Genesis is that the world is an artifact. It is made, as a potter takes clay and forms pots out of it, or as a carpenter takes wood and makes tables and chairs out of it. Don't forget, Jesus is the son of a carpenter. And also the son of God. So the image of God and of the world is based on the idea of God as a technician, potter, carpenter, architect, who has in mind a plan, and who fashions the universe in accordance with that plan.

So basic to this image of the world is the notion, you see, that the world consists of stuff, basically. Primordial matter, substance, stuff. As parts are made of clay. And the potter imposes his will on it, and makes it become whatever he wants. And so in the book of Genesis, the lord God creates Adam out of the dust of the Earth. In other words, he makes a clay figurine, and then he breathes into it, and it becomes alive. And because the clay become informed, by itself it is formless, it has no intelligence, and therefore it requires an external intelligence and an external energy to bring it to life and to put some sense to it.

And so in this way, we inherit a conception of ourselves as being artifacts, as being made, and it is perfectly natural in our culture for a child to ask its mother, ""How was I made?"" or ""Who made me?"" And this is a very, very powerful idea, but for example, it is not shared by the Chinese, or by the Hindus. A Chinese child would not ask its mother, ""How was I made?"" A Chinese child might ask its mother, ""How did I grow?"" which is an entirely different procedure from making. You see, when you make something, you put it together, you arrange parts, or you work from the outside to the in, as a sculpture works on stone, or as a potter works on clay. But when you watch something growing, it works in exactly the opposite direction. It works from the inside to the outside. It expands. It burgeons. It blossoms. And it happens all over itself at once. In other words, the original simple form, say of a living cell in the womb, progressively complicates itself, and that's the growing process, and it's quite different from the making process.

And so there is, for that reason, a fundamental difference between the made and the maker. And this image...",Alan Watts,1961,[98],1

245,Magic Moon (Clair De Lune),"CHAPTER V

THE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE

A consideration of the Vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus[1] is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrgård. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: ""No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking."" The two men laughed and cried: ""The Count is dead; we do not care for him."" But in the night the villagers ""hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him."" Then they hear a hideous laugh, ""it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all."" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. ""He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones."" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, ""pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.""

There was some vague gossip that the Count had been ""on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him."" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: ""Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you."" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how ""the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.""

This story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.

To review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.

Since some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder[2] we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:

Mein liebes Mägdchen glaubet
Beständig steif und feste,
An die gegebnen Lehren
Der immer frommen Mutter
Als Völker an der Theyse
An tödtliche Vampiere
Heyduckisch feste glauben,
Nun warte nur Christianchen,
Du willst mich gar nich lieben;
Ich will mich an dir rächen,
Und heute in Tockayer
Zu einem Vampir trinken.
Und wenn du sanfte schlummerst,
Von deinen schönen Wangen
Den frischen Purpur saugen.
Alsdenn wirst du erschrecken,
Wenn ich dich werde küssen
Und als ein Vampir küssen:
Wann du dann recht erzitterst
Und matt in meine Arme,
Gleich einer Todten sinkest
Alsdenn will ich dich fragen,
Sind meine Lehren besser,
Als deiner guten Mutter?

The poet Wieland[3] has a passing reference to the Vampire

Der Jüngling aus den Wolken
Herab gefallen, stumm und bleich,
Als hätt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,
Steht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.[4]

It would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:

Aus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,
Noch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,
Noch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.
Ist's um den geschehn,
Muss nach andern gehn,
Und das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.[6]

Even more famous are the charnel horrors of Bürger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list[6] has remained a household word.

In spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790,[7] and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh ""about the summer of 1793 or 1794""[8] read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall,[9] although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity ""was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence,[10] had remained impressed on his memory.""[11] This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which ""electrified"" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of Bürger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. ""I well recollect"" he writes, ""that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning.""[12] Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,"" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from Bürger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an édition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown.[14] In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, ""Translated from the German, by several Hands,"" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a ""Novella Morale.""[15] Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.

It was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read[16] it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: ""Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) schöpfte er grossentheils aus Bürgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erzählung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entführt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.""[17]

As we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand.""[18] Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the Bürger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture ""working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest ""that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour."" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: ""It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of Bürgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself.""[20] To suggest, as Zeiger would have it,[21] that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne[22] Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:

Ghosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling
Rise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .

is the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from ""Lachin y Gair"" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.[23]

As I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares ""quite enraptured"" him.[24] It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, ""Apollo's sexton,"" who would fain ""make Parnassus a churchyard"";[25] and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions,[26] et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: ""Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders."" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains;[27] and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.

One might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer,[28] must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:

A night of darkness and of storms!
Into the Chamber of the Tomb
Thalaba led the Old Man,
To roof him from the rain.
A night of storms! the wind
Swept through the moonless sky,
And moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;
And in the pauses if its sweep
They heard the heavy rain
Beat on the monument above.
In silence on Oneiza's grave
Her father and her husband sate.
The Cryer from the Minaret
Proclaim'd the midnight hour.
""Now, now!"" cried Thalaba;
And o'er the chamber of the tomb
There spread a lurid gleam,
Like the reflection of a sulphur fire
And in that hideous light
Oneiza stood before them. It was She . . .
Her very lineaments. . . . and such as death
Had changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;
But in her eye there dwelt
Brightness more terrible
Than all the loathsomeness of death.
""Still art thou living, wretch? ""
In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;
""And must I nightly leave my grave
To tell thee, still in vain,
God hath abandoned thee?

""This is not she!"" the Old Man exclaim'd;
""A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!""
And to the youth he held his lance;
""Strike and deliver thyself!""
""Strike HER!"" cried Thalaba,
And palsied of all power,
Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.
""Yea, strike her!"" cried a voice, whose tones
Flow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,
As when the desert shower
From death deliver'd him;
But obedient to that well-known voice,
His eye was seeking it,
When Moath, firm of heart,
Perform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse
He thrust his lance; it fell,
And howling with the wound,
Its fiendish tenant fled.
A sapphire light fell on them,
And garmented with glory, in their sight
Oneiza's spirit stood.

It is important to remark that in his notes[29] upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: ""The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he [i.e., the body] is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.""[30]

It might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.

In The New Monthly Magazine,[31] 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from ""A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron."" Here is to be read that ""among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana[32] began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the ébauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence."" Upon this the Editor has the following note: ""We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.""

The Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: ""The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.""

The Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: ""We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.'[32]

But first on earth, as Vampyre sent,
Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;
Then ghastly haunt thy native place,
And suck the blood of all thy race;
There from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283
At midnight drain the stream of life;
Yet loathe the banquet, which perforce
Must feed thy livid living corse,
Thy victims, ere they yet expire,
Shall know the demon for their sire;
As cursing thee, thou cursing them,
Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
But one that for thy crime must fall,
The youngest, best beloved of all,
Shall bless thee with a father's name--
That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!
Yet thou must end thy task and mark
Her check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,
And the last glassy glance must view
Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;
Then with unhallowed hand shall tear
The tresses of her yellow hair,
Of which, in life a lock when shorn
Affection's fondest pledge was worn--
But now is borne away by thee
Memorial o thine agony!
Yet with thine own best blood shall drip
Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;
Then stalking to thy sullen grave
Go--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,
Till these in horror shrink away
From spectre more accursed than they.""

After an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: ""We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.""

The story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass."" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets ""a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey"" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood."" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is ""surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.""

As they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity ""inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery."" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he ""directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens."" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and ""often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.""

Before long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, ""and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him."" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, ""as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.""

Having given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of a solitary wood. ""As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiffled exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound."" With a terrific effort Aubrey burst open the door and rushing into the darkness ""found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized, when a voice cried ""again baffled,"" to which a loud laugh succeeded, and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled but it was in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hand upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him--he instantly rose and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood was not longer heard."" Several peasants now hastened into the hut bearing flambeaus which illuminate the scene, and to the horror of all there is discovered hard by, the lifeless body of Ianthe. A curious dagger lies near, but her death was not the result of a blow from this weapon. ""There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, 'a Vampyre, a Vampyre!'"" It appears that Ianthe had followed the traveller to watch over his safety. Aubrey is carried back to the city in a raging fever, and the parents of the unfortunate girl die brokenhearted owing to so terrible a loss.

Whilst Aubrey lies ill Lord Ruthven arrives in Athens and establishing himself in the same house nurses the invalid with such care that past differences are forgotten, since Aubrey not only becomes reconciled to his presence but even seeks his company. Together they travel into the wildest interior of Greece, and here in some mountain pass they are attacked by brigands, from whose guns Lord Ruthven receives a shot in the shoulder. His strength strangely decreasing, a couple of days later it is plain to all that he is at the point of death. He now exacts a terrific oath that his companion shall conceal all that is known of him and that the news of his death shall not be allowed to reach England. ""Swear!"" cried the dying man, ""Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see."" Aubrey binds himself most solemnly by the prescribed oath, and in a paroxysm of hideous laughter Ruthven expires.

According to a promise which has been obtained from the robbers by a heavy bribe the body was conveyed to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. Aubrey insists that it shall be interred in the ordinary way, but when he is conducted to the place it is found that the body has disappeared, and in spite of the protestations of the band he is convinced that they have buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes. One circumstance, however, gives Aubrey much food for thought. Among the effects of the deceased he discovered a sheath of most curious pattern and make which exactly fits the dagger that had been found in the deserted hut upon the occasion of Ianthe's death.

Returning to England, as he retraces his journey through Rome to his horror Aubrey discovers that in spite of the precautions he had so carefully taken, Lord Ruthven succeeded only too well in his bad designs and now there is bitter sorrow and distress where once reigned peace and happiness. The lady had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship, and Aubrey instinctively divines that she has ""fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe.""

Upon his arrival in London the traveller is greeted by his sister, whose presentation into society had been delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, when he might be her protector. ""It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene."" Upon this gay occasion the crowd was excessive, and as Aubrey heedless and distracted is watching the gay throng a voice which he recognizes only too well, whispers in this ear: ""Remember

p. 288

your oath."" Turning he sees Lord Ruthven standing near him. A few nights later at the assembly of a near relation among the crowd of admirers by whom his sister is surrounded--the most prominent of the throng--he again perceives the mysterious and horrible figure. Hurrying forward he seizes his sister's arm and requests her immediately to accompany him home. However, before they have had time to retire again does the voice whisper close to him: ""Remember your oath!""

Aubrey now becomes almost distracted. He sees no remedy against a monster who has already once mocked at death. Even if he were to declare all that he knew it is probable that he would hardly be believed. Whenever he attends a social gathering his looks as he scans the company become so suspicious and strange that he soon acquires a reputation for great eccentricity. As the months go on his loathing and his fears drive him well-nigh to madness, so that eventually a physician is engaged to reside in the house and take charge of him. He is a little consoled by the thought that when the year and the day have passed he will at least be able to unburden his mind and be at any rate freed from his terrible oath. It so happens that he overhears a conversation between the doctor and one of his guardians who enlarges upon the melancholy circumstance of her brother being in so critical a state when Miss Aubrey is to be married on the following day. He instantly demands the name of the bridegroom and is told the Earl of Marsden. He requests to see his sister and in an hour or two she visits him. As they are conversing she opens a locket and shows him a miniature of the man who has won her affections. To his horror he perceives that it is a portrait of Lord Ruthven and falling into convulsions of rage he tramples it under foot. In twenty-four hours the period of his oath will have expired, and he implores them to delay the wedding at least for that time. Since there seems no good reason for doing this the request is disregarded, upon which Aubrey falls into so sad a state of utter depression succeeded by an outburst of fury that the physician concludes him to be not far removed from lunacy and doubles the restraint. During the night the busy preparations for the nuptial are ceaselessly continued. It appears that upon the pretext of being her brother's dearest friend and travelling

p. 289

companion Lord Ruthven had visited the house to inquire after Aubrey during his supposed derangement, and from the character of a visitor gradually insinuated himself into that of an accepted suitor. When the bridal party has assembled Aubrey, neglected by the servants, contrives to make his way into the public apartments which are decorated for the nuptials. Ere he can utter a cry, he is, however, at once perceived by Lord Ruthven who with more than human strength thrusts him, speechless with rage, from the room, at the same time whispering in his ear: ""Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to-day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!"" The attendants at once secure the unhappy man, but he can no longer support his distress. In his agonies a blood vessel breaks and he is incontinently conveyed to bed. This sad accident is kept from his sister; the marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.

""Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.

""The guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a Vampyre!""

It were not easy to overestimate the astounding sensation which was caused by this story, and the narrative is certainly not without considerable merit, for in places the eerie atmosphere is well conveyed, Nor is it difficult to understand the extraordinary influence of the tale, since it introduced a tradition which had been long forgotten and which promised infinite possibilities in the way of that sensation and melodramatic calentures which the period craved. The first separate edition of The Vampyre appeared in 1819, and was published by Sherwood. The first issue of this, which is now very rare, contains a certain amount of preliminary matter concerning the Shelleys, Byron and Godwin. This was omitted in later issues, and accordingly one often finds that copies of The Vampyre are described as First Edition, which is strictly quite correct, although they are the Second Issue,

p. 290

and naturally of far less value in a bibliographer's eyes. A large number of reprints increased with amazing rapidity and in the same year the novel was translated into French by Henri Faber, Le Vampire, nouvelle traduite de l'anglais de Lord Byron, Paris, 1819. In February, 1820, there followed under the aegis of Charles Nodier a very obvious imitation, or rather continuation by Cyprien Bérard, Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires. ""Roman de C. B. Publié par l'auteur de Jean Sbogar et de Thérèse Aubert.[34] Paris, 1820."" In 1825, a new translation of Polidori's story was given by Eusèbe de Salles. Nor was Germany behind hand, for The Vampyre was first translated in 1819: Der Vampyr. Eine Erzahlung aus dem Englischen des Lord Byron. Nebst einer Schilderung seines Aufenthaltes in Mytilene. Leipzig, 1819. In the following year there appeared at Frankfort a version by J. V. Adrian of Byron's poems and prose, wherein was included Der Blutsuger. In a collection of Byron's work the first volume of which was published at Zwickau in 1821, The Vampyre again found a place in volume V (1821), translated by Christian Karl Meifsner as Der Vampyr. The tale has also been included in various other continental collections and translations of Byron's work even until a recent date.

Yet it was well-known all the while that Polidori was the author of the story, but as Byron's was by far the greater name, so this sensational novella must be attributed to the cavaliero whose romantic adventures and the scandal of whose amours were thrilling the whole of Europe. Writing in the same Year as the great poet's death Amédée Pichot of the University of Marseilles in his Essai sur le génie et le caractère de Lord Byron[35] declared that this spurious issue ""a autant contribué à faire connaître le nom de lord Byron en France, que ses poëmes les plus estimés."" Publishers insisted upon Le Vampire, ""nouvelle,"" being included among Byron's works, and it is said that Ladvocat was furious when it was represented to him that since it was openly acknowledged that Polidori had written The Vampire, the translation should properly be no longer given among the poet's work nor put forth under his name.

As might have been expected it was not long before the Vampire appeared upon the stage, and the first play of this kind would seem to be the famous melodrama by Charles

p. 291

Nodier (with Achille Jouffroy and Carmouche) which with music by Alexandre Piccini and scenery by Ciceri, was produced in Paris on 13th June, 1820, at the Théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, whose directors were the popular M. M. Croznier and Merle. The rôle of Lord Rutwen was taken by M. Philippe; the celebrated Madame Dorval was Malvina;[36] and the new play had an extraordinary success.

It was immediately published as Le Vampire, mélodrame en trois actes avec un prologue, Par M. M. . . .; Musique, de M. Alexandre Piccini; Decors de M. Ciceri. This might be purchased at 1 fr. 25cs. ""au magasin général de pièces de Théâtre, Chez J.-N. Barba, Libraire, Palais Royal, derrière le Théâtre Français, No. 51. ""The characters in the Prologue are Ituriel, ange de la Lune, Mlle. Descotte; Oscar, génie des Mariages, M. Moëssard; and Un Vampire, M. Philippe. The scene opens in ""une grotte basaltique,"" the Caledonian caves of Staffa. Oscar and Ituriel discourse of Vampires, and the latter asks: ""Serait-il vrai que d'horribles fantômes viennent quelquefois, sous l'apparence des droits de l'hymen, égorger une vierge timide, et s'abreuver de son sang?"" This is indeed the case, and it is significant that on the morrow Malvina (Miss Aubray) is to wed ""le comte de Marsden."" A vision of the sleeping Malvina appears when ""Un spectre vêtu d'un linceuil s'échappe de la plus apparente de ces tombes"" and rushes upon her. He is swiftly repulsed by Oscar, the good genius and the curtain falls. The characters in the play are: Lord Rutwen, M. Philippe; Sir Aubray, M. Perrin ou Théringy; Malvina, Mad. Dorval; Brigitte, Mad. St. Amand; Edgar, M. Edmon; Scop, M. Pierson; Petterson, M. Dugy; Lovette, Mlle. J. Vertpré; Oscar, M. Moëssard; with attendances of Domestiques and Villageois. The drama to a certain extent adroitly follows the lines of the Polidori novel, but with notable changes, which are well contrived and introduced. Lord Rutwen and Aubray have been fellow travellers, but the latter has no suspicion of Rutwen's real nature. In fact he holds him in the dearest affection since once he was saved from death by his friend who, whilst shielding him from a brigand's attack, fell by a chance shot. When Lord Rutwen arrives to claim Malvina's hand it is with delight Aubray hails his preserver on whom he supposed killed by the bandit's gun. It is cleverly explained how

p. 292

the wound did not after all prove fatal, whereupon ""Rutwen, mes desirs sont remplis"" cries Aubray, ""nous allons être frères"" (Ils s'embrassent). Lovette a farmer's daughter of the Marsden estate is to wed Edgar, and Rutwen graciously presents himself at the marriage feast. As Lord of the Manor he is received with every respect and homage, but he immediately proceeds to attempt Lovette's virtue. Oscar ""un viellard dont la tête vénérable inspire le respect. Sa démarche a quelque chose d'imposant et de mystérieux,"" has already warned the maiden, and she coldly avoids such ardent importunities. Whilst Rutwen is actually pursuing the coy lass who shuns his embrace, Edgar in a fury fires a pistol at the seducer and he falls crying, ""Je meurs."" Aubray hastening to the spot is barely in time to receive him in his arms, and with dying lips Rutwen adjures him to swear the following oath. ""Promets-moi que Malvina ne saura point ce qui m'est arrivé; que tu ne feras rien pour venger ma mort avant que la première heure de la nuit n'ait sonné. Jure-moi le secret sur ce coeur expirant."" Aubray much moved cries, ""Je to le jure,"" and as Rutwen expires they lay the body gently on the ground. ""A`ce moment on voit la lune planer entièrement sur le corps de Rutwen, et éclairer les glaçons de la montagne. La toile tombe.""

Act III. ""représente un grand vestibule gothique, la porte de la chapelle se voit au fond."" Oscar solemnly utters words of warning to Brigitte, who is already full of fears which are not unnoticed by Malvina. When Aubray meets his sister she speaks joyfully of her marriage but as he is about to tell her of the fatal happening suddenly Rutwen appears and seizing his arm ""lui dit d'une voix sombre: 'Songe à ton serment'!"" Aubray now realizes that there is some horrid secret and displays violent emotion crying out in broken tones: ""Eloigne-toi fantôme! . . ma soeur . . . dérobe-toi, aux poursuites de ce monstre . . . il te dira qu'il est ton époux . . . refuse ton serment . . . cet hymen est un crime"" At length he is carried off by the servants who fear that he has lost his senses, an idea Rutwen encourages. In spite of this disorder the bridegroom now hotly presses on the nuptials; the great doors are opened ""et laisse voir la chapelle éclairée,"" Rutwen and Malvina approach the altar. With a wild cry Aubray rushes in to intercept the ceremony,

p. 293

upon which the monster drawing his dagger is about to plunge it deep into Malvina's heart when one o'clock strikes,--his power is gone."" Il laisse tomber son poignard et cherche & s'enfuir, des ombres sortent de la terre et l'entraînent avec elles; l'Ange exterminateur paraît dans un nuage, la foudre éclate et les Ombres s'engloutissent avec Rutwen. Pluie de feu. TABLEAU GÉNÉRAL.""

The dialogue of this melodrama is spirited, the situations striking and well managed, and even in reading the play, one can clearly visualize that upon the stage it must have been extraordinarily effective, especially when set off with all the attractions of the scene painter's glowing perspectives, the magic craft of the subtle machinist, and the richest adornment of romantic costume.[37] Even before he had introduced the Vampire on to the boards Nodier had prophesied that this macabre monster would win a veritable triumph, and his prediction was amply fulfilled. ""Le Vampire épouvantera, de son horrible amour, les songes de toutes les femmes, et bientôt sans doute, ce monstre encore exhumé prêtera son masque immobile, sa voix sépulcrale, son oeil d'un gris mort, . . . tout cet attirail de mélodrame à la Melpomène des boulevards; et quel succès alors ne lui est pas réservé!""[38] On 1st July, 1819, writing in the Drapeau Blanc he was far more serious and far more emphatic: ""La fable du vampire est peut-être la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . Elle a partout l'autorité de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de celle de la théologie ni do celle de la, médicine. La philosophie même en a parlé.""

All Paris flocked to see Le Vampire, and nightly the Porte-Saint-Martin was packed to the doors. Philippe and Madame Dorval were applauded to the echo by enthusiastic audiences who recalled them again and again after the final tableau. Even the book of the play had an immense circulation and every morning Barba's counter was freshly stocked with huge piles of the duodecimo, which rapidly diminished during the day.

Not a few critics, however, adopted a very uncompromising attitude, and were unsparing in their condemnation of so popular a melodrama. In Les Lettres Normandes, 1820, (tome XI, p. 93) Le Vampire was thus noticed: ""Le mélodrame du Vampire dans lequel on voit paraître un monstre

p. 294

qui suce le sang des petites filles et qui offre des Tableaux qu'une honnête femme ne pout voir sans rougir, est l'ouvrage de MM. Ch. Nodier, rédacteur du Drapeau Blanc; Achille Jouffroy, rédacteur de La Gazette et auteur des Festes de l'anarchie; et Carmouche autre rédacteur du Drapeau Blanc."" This censure is, however, wholly inspired by political feeling which thus inveighed against the royalist Nodier, and which not unmingled with green jealousy we also find prominent in the Conservateur littéraire of April, 1820 (Tome II, p. 245) where we had: ""Pour balancer le succès du Vampire mélodrame dégoûtant et si monstreux que les auteurs MM. Ch. Nodier et Carmouche m'ont pas osé se faire connaître, le théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin se prépare à représenter la traduction littérale, en prose, de la Marie Stuart de Schiller.""

Yet another critic is even more trenchant and severe: ""Le Vampire Ruthwen veut violer ou sucer dans les coulisses une jeune fiancée qui fuit devant lui sur le théâtre: cette situation est-elle morale? . . . Toute la pièce représente indirectement Dieu comme un être faible ou odieux qui abandonne le monde aux génies de l'enfer.""[39]

Yet all these attacks served but to enhance the attraction, and it is remarkable for how many years this continued undiminished. In 1823 a revival of Le Vampire with Philippe and Madame Dorval again thronged the Porte-Saint-Martin to excess. Alexandre Dumas, who was present at this production has recorded how vast was his delight, how ineffable his thrills during the sombre scenes of this sepulchral melodrame. How the theatre applauded the lean livid mask of the Vampire, how it shuddered at his stealthy steps! There are, perhaps, to be found throughout the whole of the many works of Alexandre, Dumas few pages more entertaining than those chapters in his Memoires which relate with rarest humour and not a few flashes of brilliant wit his adventures at a performance of Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1823. It would be difficult to find a livelier, and yet at the same time entirely serious and even critical, account of a theatrical performance. Unfortunately it is too long to give in full. In the edition of Mes Mémoires, Troisième Série, Michel Lévy, Paris, 1863, it occupies no less than five chapters, LXXIII-LXXVII, and these are none of the shortest, (pp. 136-193). One is tempted to quote some delicious passages, but the

p. 295

account might lose thereby; it must be read as a delightful whole. Yet there is one extract which May certainly be made without impertinence, the story of the Vampire which was related to Dumas by his neighbour ""le monsieur poli qui lisait un Elzévir."" They have discussed the tradition at some length, and incidentally the good bibliophile refers his young acquaintance to the work of Dom Calmet, from whom he gives ample citations. He further remarks that he has resided in Illyria for three years, and he very sharply animadverts upon certain details on Nodier's melodrama which are foreign to the vampire tradition. ""You speak of vampires as though they really existed,"" remarks Dumas. ""Of course they exist,"" said his neighbour dryly. ""Have you ever seen one then?"" ""Most certainly I have."" ""That was whilst you were in Illyria?"" ""Yes.""

""Et vous y avez vu des vampires?""

""Vous savez que c'est la, terre claissique des vampires, l'Illyrie, comme la Hongrie, la Servie, la Pologne.

""Non, je no sais pas . . . je ne sais rien. Où étaient ces vampires que vous avez vus?

""A Spalatro. Je logeais chez un bonhomme de soixante-deux ans. Il mourut. Trois jours après avoir été enterré, il apparut la nuit à son fils et lui demanda à manger; son fils le servit selon des desirs; il mangea et disparut. Le lendemain, le fils me raconta ce qui lui était arrivé, me disant que bien certainement son père ne reviendrait pas pour une fois, et m'invitant a me mettre, la nuit suivante, à une fenêtre pour le voir entrer et sortir. J'étais curieux de voir un vampire. Je me mis à la fenêtre; mais, cette nuit-la, il ne vint pas. Le fils me dit, alors, do ne pas me décourager, qu'il viendrait probablement la nuit suivante.--La nuit suivante, je me remis donc à ma fenêtre, et, en effet, vers minuit, je reconnus parfaitement le vieillard. Il venait du côté de cimetière; il marchait d'un bon pas; mais son pas ne faisait aucun bruit. Arrivé à la porte, il frappa,; je comptai trois coups; les coups résonnèrent secs sur le chêne, comme si l'on eut frappé avec un os, et non avec un doigt. Le fils, vint ouvrir la porte, et le vieillard entra. . . .

""J'écoutais ce récit avec la plus grande attention, et je commençais à prefèrer les entr'actes au mélodrame.

""Ma curiosité était trop vivement excitée, reprit men voisin,

p. 296

pour que je quittasse ma fenêtre; j'y demeurai donc. Une demi-heure après, le vieillard sortit; il retournait d'où il était venu, c'est-a-dire du côté du cimetiere. A l'angle d'une muraille, il disparut. Presque au même instant, ma porte s'ouvrit. Je me retournai vivement, c'était son fils. It était fort pâle. 'Et bien, lui dis-je, votre père est venu?--Oui . . . L'avez-vous vu entrer? Entrer et sortir. . . Qu'a-t-il fait aujourd'hui? Il m'a demandé à boire et à manger, comme l'autre jour. Et il a bu et mangé? Il a bu et mangé . . . Mais ce n'est pas le tout. . . voici ce qui m'inquiète. . . Il m'a dit . . . Ah! il vous a parlé pour autre chose que pour vous demander à, boire et a manger? . . . Oui, il m'a dit: 'Voici deux fois que je viens manger chez toi. C'est à ton tour maintenant de venir manger chez moi.' Diable! . . . Je l'attends après demain à la même heure. Diable! Diable! Eh! oui, justement, voilà ce qui me tracasse.' Le surlendemain, on le trouva mort dans son lit! Ce même jour, deux ou trois autres, personnes du même village qui avaient vu aussi le vieillard, et qui lui avaient parlé, tombèrent malades et moururent à leur tour. Il fut donc reconnu que le vieillard était vampire. On s'informa auprès de moi; je racontai ce que favais vu et entendu. La justice se transporta au cimetière. On ouvrit les tombeaux de tous ceux qui étaient morts depuis six semaines; tous ces, cadavres étaient en décomposition. Mais, quand on en vint au tombeau de Kisilova,--c'était le nom du vieillard,--on le trouva les yeux ouverts, la bouche vermeille, respirant à pleins poumons, et cependant immobile, comme mort. On lui enfonça un pieu dans le coeur; il jeta un grand cri, et rendit le sang par le bouche; puis on le mit sur un bûcher, on le réduisit en cendre, et l'on jeta la cendre au vent. . . . Quelque temps après, je quittai le pays de sorte que je ne pus savoir si son fils était devenu vampire comme lui.

""Pourquoi serait-il devenu vampire comme lui? demandai-je.

""Ah! parce que c'est l'habitude, que les personnes qui meurent du vampirisme deviennent vampires.

""En vérité, vous dites cela comme si c'était un fait avéré.

""Mais c'est qu'aussi c'est un fait avéré, connu, enregistré!""

It will readily be remembered that in Monte-Cristo when

p. 297

during the performance of Parisina at the Teatro Argentino, Rome, the Count and Haidée enter their box, the Countess G------ directing her opera-glass in that direction asks Franz d'Epinay who they may be remarking that as for herself, ""All I can say is that the gentleman whose history I am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up; be looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!"" ""Oh, he is always as colourless as you now see him,"" said Franz. ""Then you know him?"" almost screamed the countess. ""Oh! pray do, for Heaven's sake, tell us all about--is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse, or what?"" A few moments later when the lady has carefully studied the loge of their mysterious vis-à-vis, Franz demands: ""Well, what do you think of our mysterious neighbour?"" ""Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living frame,"" was the reply. This fresh allusion to Byron drew a smile to Franz's countenance; although he could not but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . . . . . Is it possible,"" whispered Franz, ""that you entertain any fear?"" ""I'll tell you,"" answered the countess. ""Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me he had seen some. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us. Oh! it is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect. The coal-black hair, large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems burning,-the same ghastly paleness!""[40]

Nearly thirty years after Dumas in collaboration with Maquet utilized the theme of Le Vampire for his own drama of the same name which was given at the Ambigu-Comique, 20th December, 1851, and which may conveniently be considered here.

Le Vampire is described as a ""Drame Fantastique en Cinq Actes, en Dix Tableaux"" and there are very many characters in this remarkable play. The principal parts were taken as follows: Lord Ruthwen, M. Arnault; Gilbert de Tiffauges, M. Goujet; Juan Rozo, a Spanish inn-keeper, M. Coquet;

p. 298

Botaro, his son-in-law, M. Curcy; Lazare, M. Laurent; Lahennée, M. Thierry; Jarwick, M. Lavergne; the Ghoul, Mme. Lucie Mabire; Hélène de Tiffauges, Mile. Jane Essler; Juana, Mile. Marie Clarisse; Antonia, Mlle. Daroux; Petra, Rozo's daughter, Mile. Heloïse; and the mystic fairy Mélusine, Mlle. Isabelle Constant. Lazare is a capital character, but the intrusion from Oriental legend of the ghoul cannot be considered happy. On the other hand the appearance of Mélusine, whose legend was collected about the end of the fourteenth century by Jean d'Arras, is certainly effective and entirely in keeping with the history, since according to Paracelsus she was an occult power, and in folk lore she is often represented as protecting ancient houses--in Belgium she is the guardian of the old family de Gavre,--whilst one of her four sons became King of Brittany.

It is hardly necessary to do more than give the very briefest outline of the story as Dumas tells it. The play opens with a crowded scene of merrymakers in the patio of Juan Rozo's inn. They are celebrating the nuptials of his daughter with young Botaro, and every room is occupied by his friends. and acquaintance in festive mood. Juana, who is staying at the hostlery seeks for a guide to the castle of Tormenar, which lies at some little distance, for there she is to meet Don Luis de Figuerroa, whom she will wed upon the following day. She has secretly left the convent of Annunciades, where she was a boarder, since her father has other designs for her hand, and accordingly it is necessary that she should meet her betrothed in some lonely spot. But nobody, not even the good-natured Lazare, the servant of the inn, will conduct her to the haunted castle, ""un château qui est en ruine, un château qui ne loge que des reptiles, et qui n'héberge que des fantômes."" However, a numerous company, amongst whom is Gilbert de Tiffauges, arrives at the inn, and these travellers on being told that they cannot be accommodated in spite of the fact that night is falling, incontinently resolve to take up their quarters in Tormenar, so in spite of the warnings about ghosts and goblins, having once well stocked themselves with wine and food they merrily set forth, Gilbert taking charge of Juana who has confided to him her story. However, a mysterious figure, a lady, apparently of rank, who has been staying at the inn watches them as they take

p. 299

their departure and mutters to herself as she fixes her gaze upon Juana: ""Il te faut deux heures pour aller retrouver ton beau fiancé. . . . Je l'aurai joint dans trois minutes!"" She is in fact the ghoul, a female vampire, and with the speed of lightning she has gone to destroy the unfortunate Don Luis.

In the second Act we see the huge Gothic hall of the old castle. A door opens and from an inner chamber the ghoul rushes out exclaiming: ""Il était jeune! Il était beau! . . . Me voilà, redevenue jeune et belle!"" The voice of Gilbert is now heard, and with the cry, ""À l'an prochain, Gilbert."" she disappears from sight. It will be remarked that in his treatment of the vampire tradition Dumas has adopted the legend that the vampire must year by year rejuvenate his waning forces by absorbing the life of another and sucking from another's veins fresh blood, a detail which although it may recommend itself to, and legitimately be used by, the dramatist and the writer of romances is actually inexact and but rarely to be met with, and only then in folk-lore not of the first value. The travellers, no small party, spread their provisions upon the huge tables in the old hall and laughing at the stories of ghosts and apparitions are soon in convivial mood. The conversation, however, eventually turns on the supernatural and Gilbert tells of his old home in Brittany, where one room in the castle is hung with the tapestry of the Fairy Mélusine, representing this lady and all her attendants. The story goes that if any of the family sleeps in that room she will descend from the tapestry and reveal his fortune, warning him of danger should such threaten. Another companion who has sojourned in Epirus speaks of the vampires, the women who will attack men and leave them dead and sapless; the men who will attack women to drink their blood. Just as the words are uttered Lord Ruthwen enters and announces himself as a belated traveller, who, finding no room at Rozo's inn down in the village has made his way thither,-he has even taken Lazare into his service. Presently the company disperse to their several rooms to make themselves as comfortable as may be for the night in such difficult circumstances. To his horror Gilbert discovers in the chamber he is to occupy the body of a young man, strangely pale, with a slight wound in the throat. By a letter he finds near upon the body it is plain that this can be none other

p. 300

than the unfortunate Don Luis. At the same moment a piercing cry is heard, and Juana ghostly pale and dying totters from her room. Gilbert rushes to her assistance just in time to see Lord Ruthwen dart out after her as she falls dead at his feet. In a moment he has drawn his sword and strikes Ruthwen to the heart, before he recognizes who it may be. In faltering accents Ruthwen explains that hearing a cry he has gone to the assistance of the lady, and with his last breath he implores Gilbert, who is well-nigh distracted at the unhappy accident, to bear his body to the hillside, where it may be bathed in the earliest rays of the new moon. This Gilbert promises, and in the final tableau we see the body of Lord Ruthwen laid upon the mountain. The moon slowly issues from the clouds, and as its silver light falls upon the corpse it seems as though the eyes opened and the mouth smiled. A moment more and the Vampire leaps to his feet re-vitalized and with fresh energy for some new demoniac enterprise.

In Act III. we find ourselves in Brittany, about a year later, at the château de Tiffauges where Hélène awaits her brother's return. After an affectionate greeting he confides to her the secret of his love for Antonia a lady of Spalatro in Dalmatia, and she in her turn informs him that she is about to give her hand to the Baron de Marsden. This latter proves to be none other than Lord Ruthwen, who informs Gilbert that he was sore wounded indeed at Tormenar, but that certain kindly shepherds finding him on the mountain side nursed him back to life. Moreover, he explains his change of name by informing them that his elder brother having recently died, he has succeeded to the title and estates. Visiting Tiffauges in the hope of meeting Gilbert once more, he has fallen a victim to the charms of Hélène. The explanation is cleverly contrived, but at the same time Gilbert is hardly convinced; he feels that there is some mysterious and terrible secret lurking in the background. A happy idea strikes him. He will sleep that night in the tapestry chamber of the lady Mélusine. The scene that follows must have been extraordinarily effective upon the stage. Gilbert is slumbering, and from their places in the tapestry step forth Mélusine and her court to warn the scion of her house that danger is near. From the framed canvas and the panels descend with stately stride

p. 301

the old barons to tell their descendant of the horror that encompasses him, Mélusine reveals the secret.

""Prions, pour qu' à Gilbert Dieu tout-puissant inspire Un généreux effort.
Ruthwen est un démon, Ruthwen est un vampire; Son amour, c'est la mort!""

(One cannot but recall the famous scene in Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore with its subtle admixture of beauty, fantasy and humour.)

In Act IV of Le Vampire we are shown the accomplishment of Ruthwen's designs against Hélène. Gilbert's frenzied warnings and denunciations are heard with alarm but with unbelief. They whisper that he is a lunatic, and when Ruthwen relates a cunning story of a mischance in Spain which temporarily unsettled Gilbert's reason, a story that seems borne out in every detail by the unhappy brother's horror and despair, the attendants for his own safety seek to restrain their young master. Ruthwen triumphs. But now the ghoul appears and bids him take heed how he seeks Gilbert's life for that is hers, and she will not likely relinquish her prey. Ruthwen defies her and the two vampires part in horrid enmity. Lazare cautions Hélène that her brother's story is no figment, but it is too late, the vampire seizes his victim and as midnight strikes, he destroys his hapless bride and quaffs his fill from her veins. Too late Gilbert succeeds in forcing an entrance. There is a terrific struggle, and Ruthwen is hurled from the window into the depths of a tremendous valley.

In the last act we find that in order to escape the pursuit of Ruthwen, who has extricated himself unhurt but filled with designs of even more malignant vengeance, Gilbert has transported Antonia to Circassia. Here, however, we meet the ghoul who, disguising herself under the name of Ziska, obtained admittance to the castle in the quality of an attendant upon Antonia. She informs Gilbert that she alone can save his betrothed from the vampire, and at that moment the ghastly face of Ruthwen is actually seen peering through the window. She demands that he shall relinquish Antonia's hand, and accept her love though it be to death. He refuses to betray Antonia, and at length by a supreme act of renunciation she divulges the secret whereby the Vampire may be annihilated, although this revelation must put an end to her own

p. 302

existence. Ziska explains how Gilbert's sword is to be blessed by a priest with a certain occult formula and if the weapon thus consecrated be driven through the Vampire's heart it will once and for all rid the world of this infernal pest. Yet as she speaks she seems to vanish in flames and they hear her last sad sigh; ""Adieu pour ce monde! Adieu pour l'autre! Adieu pour l'éternité""!

The final scene is a deserted cemetery. ""Tombes, cyprès. Fond sombre et fantastique; neige sur la terre; lune rouge au ciel."" The Vampire lies half in and half out of his grave, grinning hideously. Gilbert is standing near. ""Pour la dernière fois, adore Dieu!"" he adjures. ""Non,"" yells the monster. ""Alors, desespère et meurs""! cries Gilbert and plunges the hallowed sword into the monster's heart. The Vampire falls back into the grave, howling fearfully, and a heavy stone closing him in fast seals him there in the womb of the earth for ever and ever. ""Au nom du Seigneur, Ruthwen, je to scelle dans cette tombe pour l'éternité"", et Gilbert trace sur la pierre une croix que devient lumineuse. A great aureola fills the sky and. multitudes of rejoicing angels are seen. Among them are Hélène and Juana, smiling in happiest benison, whilst there rises from the earth the body of Ziska, radiant and beautiful, to join the glorious throng among whose immortal ranks she is enrolled by the merits of her great act of renunciation and unselfish love.

This drama of Dumas is infinitely more elaborate than the play of Nodier, but I am not altogether certain whether it is in some respects so good a work. The first two acts attain a high level; the scene in the tapestry chamber would be most picturesque upon the stage; there are several other telling situations and effective speeches, but as a whole it is too prolix, and we feel that the episode of Antonia in particular is an anti-climax. Nor, as I have remarked before, although material use is made of the character, can one consider the figure of the ghoul entirely in keeping with the rest. Had the level of the opening scenes been maintained we should possess an excellent piece of work. But without concentration and compression that was hardly possible, and here we have the secret of Nodier's success. Although he has an occasional crudity, it may be, which Dumas might not have tolerated, so swift is his action, as is essential to

p. 303

melodrama, so cleverly does he engage the interest of his audience, that we have no time to criticize a roughness here and there, but are rather intent to follow the next turn of the tale.

Immediately upon the furore created by Nodier's Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1819 vampire plays of every kind from the most luridly sensational to the most farcically ridiculous pressed on to the boards. A contemporary critic cries: ""There is not a theatre in Paris without its Vampire! At the Porte-Saint-Martin we have le Vampire; at the Vaudeville le Vampire again; at the Variétés les trois Vampires ou le clair de la lune.""

Jean Larat[41] further mentions a play by Paul Féval, Le fils Vampire. The version by John Wilson Ross of The Loves of Paris, a romance, published by G. Vickers, 3, Catherine Street, Strand, 1846, is said to be ""Translated from the French of Paul Féval, author of 'The Vampire,' 'The Loves of the Palais-Royal,' 'The Receipt at Midnight,' 'Stella,' 'The Son of the Devil,' etc., etc."", but it does not appear whether ""The Vampire"" mentioned here is a play or a romance. Probably it is the latter but no such translation is known.

Le Vampire which was produced at the Vaudeville, 15 June, 1820,[42] is a comédic-vaudeville in one act by Scribe and Mélesville. The scene is laid Hungary, ""une salle d'un chateau gothique,"" and the characters are as follows: Le Comte de Valberg, feld-maréchal, M. Guillemin; Adolphe de Valberg, son néveu, M. Isambert; le Baron do Lourdorff, M. Fontenay; Saussmann, concierge du chateau, M. Hippolyte; Charles, valet du comte, M. Fichet; un Notaire, M. Justin; Hermance de Mansfred, Madame Rivière; Nancy, sa soeur, Madame Lucie; Péters, filleul de Saussmann, Madame Minette; with attendance of domestics and wedding guests. This elegant little piece opens with nuptials of Hermance de Mansfred at the castle of the Baron de Lourdorff, to whom she is betrothed. It appears that she has something trifled with the affections of Adolphe de Valberg, now supposed dead. Her sister, Nancy, acknowledges that she loved Adolphe, but kept silence owing to his courtship of Hermance. Adolphe's uncle, the Count de Valberg, who knows nothing of the two ladies, fearing his nephew is unworthily entangled has had him held in military detention at Temesvar, whence

p. 304

however he has disappeared. The intrigue of the seventeen scenes, although clearly unravelled in the play, is a little complicated, and it must suffice to relate by an accident Adolphe appears at the castle. Upon being asked his name he answers: ""Lord Ruthwen. An Englishman,"" whereupon he is immediately taken to be a Vampire and the servants are thrown into a state of panic. Eventually he is reconciled to his uncle who recognizes him as the brave young hero by whom his life was saved on a recent battlefield; Nancy's fidelity is rewarded with the hand of the man she loves, and who now realizes that Hermance's heart was never his; so that the curtain falls upon a double wedding.

Several Pretty lyrics are interwoven with the dialogue and Nancy's first song, to the air ""De sommeiller, encor ma chère from Fanchon la vielleuse, is as follows:

Oui, ces paysans respectables
Nous rapellent le bon vieux temps:
Chez eux on croit encore au diable,
Aux vampires, au revenants;
On croit à toutes les magies,
Aux amours, aux soins assidus,
Aux grands sorciers, aux grands genies . . .
Bref à tout ce qu'on ne voit plus!

Les Trois Vampires, ou le clair de, la lune[43] which was being played at the Variétés is a thoroughly amusing farce in one act by Brazier, Gabriel, and Armand. It shows the adventures of a bon bourgeois, M. Gobetout, who has so distracted his brain by reading stories of Vampires and ghosts that when one night he sees in his garden three shadowy figures he is well nigh beside himself with terror as he supposes they can be no other than three vampires infesting his house. A little later he catches sight of his two daughters and their abigail who appear actually to be eating with the mysterious strangers. ""Les vampires qui soupent avec mes filles!"" he groans in accents of despair. However it proves that the supper is very material, cold chicken and a glass of good wine, whilst the rendezvous is of an amorous nature, since the visitors are two young sparks and their valet. So the play ends with a triple marriage. One remark of the worthy M. Gobetout was, it is said, nightly greeted with a hurricane of applause. He was wont to murmur in pensive accents: ""Les vampires

p. 305

il nous viennent d'Angleterre . . . C'est encore une gentilesse de ces Messieurs . . . ils nous font de jolis cadeaux!""

Another farce, Encore un Vampire, which when produced in 1820 at Paris, met with considerable success, was published as by Emile B. L., and yet another vampire burlesque was contributed by A. Rousseau. Les Etrennes d'un Vampire at a minor theatre was billed as from a manuscript ""trouvé au cimitière de Père-Lachaise.""

More amusing is the work of Désaugiers who in August, 1820, gave Cadet Buteux, vampire, avec relation véridique du prologue et des trois actes de cet épouvantable mélodrame écrit sous la dictée de ce passeux du Gros Caillou, par son secretaire, Désaugiers. When published by Rosa, 1820, this libretto bore the motto: ""Vivent les morts!""

Yet another burlesque published by Martinet, 1820, is Le Vampire, mélodrame en trois actes, paroles de Pierre de la Fosse de la rue des Morts.[44] A few verses from this vaudeville may be interesting to quote, particularly as showing the long continued popularity of Nodier's melodrama.

Lisant pour un sou d'politique
Plac' Royale, sur un banc,
J'tombe, le tour est diabolique,
A' point nommé, sur l'Drapeau blanc.

J'prends un billet, non pas pour le parterre,
Ces places sont réservées aux amis,
Sans l'secours de l'abbé Saint-Pierre,
Avec treiz sous' j'monte au paradis.

Au dernier bane, paix, qu'chacun s'taise
A' bas la gueule on crie du premier rang,
L'rideau s'lève et quoique très mal à l'aise,
Le croirez-vous, j'vois le Père Lachaise,
Du dernier bane.

The Vampire is described as ""d'échappé de corbillard,"" One sees everywhere

Des fantôms, des revenans,
Mettant la téte a la fenêtre,
Afin d'regarder les passans.

There was even a Polichinel Vampire which when performed at the Circus Maurice in 1822 attracted all who had a mind

p. 306

for a hearty laugh, and a contemporary visitor[45] to Paris merrily wrote that ""Polichinel is the very jolliest fellow in the world.""[46]

A comic operetta in one act, Le Vampire by Martin Joseph Mengals which was produced at Ghent, 1 March, 1826, deserves no more than passing mention.

James Robinson Planché speedily adapted Nodier's Le Vampire as The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles, and his version with music by Joseph Binns Hart[47] was brought out at the English Opera House, 9th August, 1820, with T. P. Cooke[48] as Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire. Owing to his fine acting in the part, and perhaps a little to the scenic effects--the scene is laid in the Caverns of Staffa--the play was given nightly to packed houses. It is interesting to remark that for this piece the celebrated vampire trap was invented. Of this I quote the following simple description: ""A vampire trap consists of two or more flaps, usually india-rubber, through which the sprite can disappear almost instantly, where he falls into a blanket fixed to the under surface of the stage. As with the star trap, this trap is secured against accidents by placing another piece or slide, fitting close beneath when not required, and removed when the prompter's bell gives the signal to make ready.""

The following account of the production of The Vampire is given by Planché in his Recollections and Reflections, Chapter III.[49] Having just spoken of an Easter piece with which he had furnished Drury Lane, Abudah, or, The Talisman of Oromanes,[50] founded upon one of the Tales of the Genii[51] and which although it had a run of nine nights Planché calls a very poor piece, ""miserably put on the stage,"" he continues to speak of a subsequent success, and tells us: ""A more fortunate melodrama of mine, ""The Vampire, or The Bride of the Isles,"" was produced at the Lyceum, or English Opera House, as it was then called, 9th August, 1820. Mr. Samuel James Arnold, the proprietor and manager, had placed in my hands, for adaptation, a French melodrama, entitled ""Le Vampire,"" the scene of which was laid, with the usual recklessness of French dramatists, in Scotland, where the superstition never existed. I vainly endeavoured to induce Mr. Arnold to let me change it to some place in the East of Europe. He had set his heart on Scotch music and dresses--

p. 307

the latter, by the way, were in stock--laughed at my scruples, assured me that the public would neither know nor care--and in those days they certainly did not--and therefore there was nothing left for me but to do my best with it. The result was most satisfactory to the management. The situations were novel and effective; the music lively and popular; the cast strong, comprising T. P. Cooke, who made a great hit in the principal character, Harley, Bartley, Pearman, Mrs. Chatterley and Miss Love. The trap now so well known as ""the Vampire trap"" was invented for this piece, and the final disappearance of the Vampire caused quite a sensation. The melodrama had a long run, was often revived, and is to this day a stock piece in the country. I had an opportunity many years afterwards, however, to treat the same subject in a manner much more satisfactory to myself, and, as it happened, in the same theatre, under the same management; but of that anon.""

The full cast of The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles was originally as follows: ""In the Introductory Vision""; Unda, Spirit of the Flood, Miss Love; Ariel, Spirit of the Air, Miss Worgman; The Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Lady Margaret, Mrs. Chatterly. ""In the Drama "": Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Ronald, Baron of the Isles, Mr. Bartley; Robert, an English Attendant on the Baron, Mr. Pearman; M'Swill, the Baron's Henchman, Mr. Harley; Andrew, Steward to Ruthven, Mr. Minton; Father Francis, Mr. Shaw; Lady Margaret, Daughter of Ronald, Mrs. Chatterly; Effie, Daughter of Andrew, Miss Carew; Bridget Lord Ronald's Housekeeper, Mrs. Grove. With regard to the costumes of which Planché speaks it is interesting to remark that the principal characters Ruthven and Lady Margaret are described as follows: Ruthven, Silver breast plate, studded with steel buttons; plaid kilt; philibeg; flesh arms and leggings; sandals; Scotch hat and feathers; sword and dagger. Lady Margaret, white satin dress, trimmed with plaid and silver; plaid silk sash; Scotch hat and feather. This is in the true transpontine tradition of Ossianic attire. The play is timed to take one hour and thirty minutes in representation-and Planché has done his work of adaptation very well, although I doubt whether his few slight departures from the original are improvements. Nevertheless he has

p. 308

given the dialogue a native turn and an ease which were at this period too often lacking in similar versions from the French.

In 1825, T. P. Cooke visited Paris and appeared as Le Monstre at the Porte-Saint-Martin in Planché's melodrama which proved a remarkable success, running for no less than eighty nights.

The Vampire or The Bride of the Isles has its place among the repertory of Hodgson's ""Juvenile Drama,"" and this in itself is an indication of no small popularity.

In The Second Maiden's Tragedy,[52] a Globe play of 1611, licensed for the stage by Sir George Buc on 31st October of that year, a macabre drama now generally attributed to Tourneur,[53] there are some remarkable scenes which culminate in something very like necrophilia, and a perverse ill-omened melancholy pervades the whole action. In Act IV the Tyrant, a usurper, ordering soldiers to attend him with ""Lanthornes and a pickax"" makes his way at midnight to the Cathedral, crying:

Death nor the marble prison my love sleeps in
Shall keep her body lockt up from mine arms.
I must not be so cozened.

A little later: ""Enter the Tirant agen at a farder dore, which opened, bringes hym to the Toombe wher the Lady lies buried; The Toombe here discouered ritchly set forthe."" He adjures the sepulchre:

The house of silence and the Calms of rest
After tempestuous life, I claim of thee
A mistress one of the most beauteous sleepers
That ever lay so cold.

The vault is forced, whilst the lover soliloquizes:

O the moon rises; what reflection
Is thrown about the sanctified building,
E'en in a twinkling, how the monuments glisten
As if Death's palaces were all massy silver
And scorned the name of marble. Art thou cold?
I have no faith in't, yet I believe none.
Madam; 'tis I, sweet lady, pry'thee speak
'Tis thy love calls on thee; thy king, thy servant.
No! not a word, all prisoners to pale silence
I'll prove a kiss.

p. 309

First Soldier:

Here's chill venery!
'Twould make a pandar's heels ache. I'll be sworn
All my teeth chatter in my head to see't.

Tyrant:

By th' mass, thou'rt cold indeed. Beshrew thee for't,
Unkind to thine own blood? Hard hearted lady,
What injury hast thou offered to the youth
And pleasure of thy days: refuse the Court
And steal to this hard lodging, was that wisdom
.      .      .      .      Since thy life has left me
I'll clasp the body for the spirit that dwelt in't,
And love the house still for the mistress' sake.
Thou art mine now spite of destruction
And Govianus; and I will possess thee.
I once read of a Herod whose affection.
Pursued a virgin's love as I did thine,
Who for the hate she owed him killed herself
(As thou too rashly didst), without all pity;
Yet he preserved her body dead in honey,
And kept her long after her funeral:
But I'll unlock the treasure house of art
With keys of gold and bestow all on thee
Here slaves receive her humbly from our arms,
.      .      .      .      So reverently
Bear her before us gently to our palace.
Place you the stone again where we first found it.

After a while the scene is in the palace: ""They bringe the Body in a Chaire drest up in black veluet which setts out the pailenes of the handes and face, And a faire Chayne of pearle crosse her brest and the Crucyfex aboue it; He standes silent awhile letting the Musique play, beeknyng the soldiers that bringe her in to make obeisaunce to her, and he hym self makes a lowe honour to the body and kisses the hande. A song within in Voyces.

Song:

O what is Beauty that's so much adored
A flattring glass that cozens her beholders.
The Night of Death makes it look pale and horrid
The Daynty preseru'd flesh how soone it molders
To loue it lyuinge it bewitchett manye
But after life is seldom heard of any.""

Tyrant:

How pleasing art thou to us even in death
I love thee yet, above all women living
And shall do seven years hence. p. 310
I can see nothing to be mended in thee
But the too constant paleness of thy cheek.
I'd give the kingdom, but to purchase there
The breadth of a red Rose, in natural colour,
And think it the best bargain that ever king made yet,
But Fate's my hinderer,
And I must only rest content with Art,
And that I'll have in spite on't.

Accordingly an artist in painting and perfumery is summoned to adorn the face of the corpse and give it a fresh lively red colour. However this merchant of cosmetics is none other than Govianus, the rightful heir, disguised, and he fucuses the dead cheeks and lips with a peter which is confected with a strong poison, so that when the Tyrant lustfully kisses the cold flesh, he is blasted with the venom and falls in the agonies of death. The incident is extremely powerful, if extremely horrible. As the Tyrant expires Govianus taunts him thus

O thou sacrilegious villain,
Thou thief of rest, robber of monuments,
Cannot the body after funeral
Sleep in the grave for thee? Must it be raised?
Only to please the wickedness of thine eye?
Does all things end with death and not thy lust?
Hast thou devised a new way to damnation,
More dreadful than the soul of any sin
Did ever pass yet between earth and hell?

A very large number of plays are founded upon what may be termed the ""Romeo and Juliet"" motive, the awakening, or the restoration to life in some sort, of a loved one supposed dead, arousing from a trance, it may be, or a coma, a theme admitting almost innumerable variants. In the Italian, French and German theatres alone--nor does this rough list pretend to be exhaustive--we have Sforza d' Oddi's Imorti vivi (1576); Pagnini's Imorti vivi (1600); Rota's La morta viva (1674); Douville's Les morts vivans (1654); Quinault's Le fantôme amoureux (1659); Boursault's Le Mort vivant (1662); Sedaine's Der Tote ein Freyer (1778); Kurländer's Der tote Neffe; Friedrich Rambach's Der Scheintote; Leopold Huber's Der Scheintote; Theodore Friedrich's Die Scheintoten; F. L. W. Meyer's Der Verstorbene; G. Lebrun's Die Verstorbenen; Tenelli's Der Verstorbene; Holbein's ""romantisches Gemälde"" Der Verstorbene; Paers' opera Die lebenden Toten; and a ballet

It may be convenient here briefly to review the progress of the Vampire in the theatre, at least in his most important appearances.

An Italian opera, I vampiri, the work of the much applauded Neapolitian composer Silvestro di Palma, which was performed at the Teatro San Carlo[54] in 1800 did not of course take anything from the novel by Polidori which indeed, it preceded by nearly twenty years. but was rather inspired by the famous treatise of Guiseppe Davanzati: Dissertazione sopra i Vampiri di Gioseppe Davanzati Patrizio Fiorentino e Tranese, Cavaliere Gerosolimitano, Arcivescovo di Trani, e Patriarca d'Alessandria. (Seconda edizione.) Nalopi. M.D.CC.LXXXIX. Presso Filippo Raimondi. Con licenzi de' Superiori.

On 28th March, 1828,[65] at Leipzig, was produced an opera, ""Grosse romantische Oper,"" Der Vampyr, founded on the original French melodrama, the scene being changed from Scotland to Hungary. The libretto is by Wilhelm August Wohlbrück and the music by his yet more famous brother-in-law Heinrich August Marschner. Der Vampyr was an enormous success. A free adaptation of this being made by J. R. Planché, and produced at the Lyceum, 25th August, 1829, it ran for sixty nights. In his Recollections and Reflections which have before been quoted, Planché commences Chapter X by some account of this. ""In the summer of 1829 I had the opportunity of treating the subject of 'The Vampire' in accordance with my own ideas of propriety. The French melodrama had been converted into an opera for the German stage, and the music composed by Marschner.

""Mr. Hawes, who had obtained a score of it, having induced Mr. Arnold to produce it at the Lyceum, I was engaged to write the libretto, and consequently laid the scene of action in Hungary, where the superstition exists to this day, substituted for a Scotch chieftain a Wallachian Boyard, and in many other respects improved upon my earlier version. The opera was extremely well sung, and the costumes novel as well as correct, thanks to the kindness of Dr. Walsh, the traveller,[66] who gave me some valuable information respecting the national dresses of the Magyars and the Wallachians.

p. 312

""I am surprised that Marschner's most dramatic and melodious works, 'Der Vampyr,' 'Die Judin,' &c., have not been introduced to our more advanced musical audiences at one or other of our great operatic establishments.

""The production of 'Der Vampyr' was followed by that of 'The Brigand' at Drury Lane.""

Polidori's tale formed the basis of a romantic opera in three acts, the libretto of which was from the pen of C. M. Heigel, and the music by p. von Lindpaintner. This was seen at Stuttgart on 2 Ist September, 1828, and it proved a remarkable success. It was announced as being from ""Byron's famous tale,"" although at this date such an attribution can hardly have deceived any.

On 25th May, 1857, there was produced in Berlin a ""Komischen Zauber-Ballet Morgano"" by Paul Taglioni with music by J. Hertzel. The scene is laid in Hungary during the seventeenth century, and in the sixth tableau Elsa dances an infernal lavolta with the vampires in their haunted castle, but she is rescued by her lover, Retzka, who slays the vampire Morgano with a consecrated poniard. In 1861 at Milan appeared a ballet by Rotta, Il vampiro, with music by Paolo Giorza. Guten Abend Herr Fischer! oder, Der Vampyr is a light vaudeville in one act by G. Belly and G. Löffler, with music by W. Telle, which had some success in its day. Ein Vampyr by Ulrich Franks (Ulla Wolf) given at Vienna in 1877 is a farce taken from Scribe.

In England Dion Boucicault's[57] The Vampire, in three acts was produced at the Princess's Theatre, London, 19th June, 1852, when the author made his first appearance before a metropolitan audience. Of this drama the following criticism, if criticism it may be called, was given by Henry Morley in his ""Journal of a London Playgoer."" It must be remembered that Morley continually shows himself extremely prejudiced and his censure must not be taken any more seriously than we regard the ill-word of many critics to-day, for example, the shrill petulant piping and the childish miffs of St. John Ervine in the sullens. Under 19th June Morley writes: ""If there be any truth in the old adage, that 'when things are at the worst they must mend,' the bettering of Spectral Melodrama is not distant; for it has reached the extreme point of inanity in the new piece which was produced on

p. 313

Monday at the Princess's Theatre, under the attractive title of The Vampire.

""Its plot is chiefly copied from a piece which some years ago turned the Lyceum into a Chamber of Horrors; but it has been spun out into three parts, facetiously described as 'Three Dramas': the little period of a century has been interposed between each part; and, in order that the outrage on the possible shall be complete, the third part is projected forward into the year that will be 1860! By this ingenious arrangement, the resuscitation of the original Vampire has been enabled to supply the lovers of the revolting at the Princess's with three acts of murder--that is, two consumated, and one attempted; but, as the delicate process of vampirical killing is exactly after the same pattern in each case, the horror is quite worn out before the career of the creature terminates. Nothing but tedious trash remains.

""To 'an honest ghost' one has no objection; but an animated corpse which goes about in Christian attire, and although never known to eat, or drink, or shake hands, is allowed to sit at good men's feasts; which renews its odious life every hundred years by sucking a young lady's blood, after fascinating her by motions which resemble mesmerism burlesqued; and which, notwithstanding its well-purchased longevity, is capable of being killed during its term in order that it may be revived by moonbeams--such a ghost as this passes all bounds of toleration.

""The monster of absurdity was personated by its reviver Mr. Boucicault, with due paleness of visage, stealthiness of pace, and solemnity of tone; the scenery, especially a moonlit ridge amidst the heights of Snowdon, was beautiful, and the costumes were prettily diversified; but the dreary repetition of fantastical horror almost exhausted even the patience which a benefit enjoins. Unfortunately, the mischief of such a piece, produced at a respectable theatre, does not end with the weariness of the spectators, who come to shudder and remain to yawn; for it is not only 'beside the purpose of playing,' but directly contravenes it; and though it may be too dull to pervert the tastes of those who witness its vapid extravagances, it has power to bring discredit on the most genial of arts.""

It may be pointed out that this account, probably through ignorance, possibly of intent, is deliberately inaccurate. p. 314 Although confessedly a poorer play than Planché's The Vampire Dion Boucicault's drama is not derived from the earlier piece, but both are taken from the same source, Polidori's romance. Seeing that Henry Morley was Emeritus Professor of English Literature in University College, London, it were reasonable to suppose that he should have been acquainted with Polidori's novella. Or perhaps I rather ought to say that therefor it was not to be expected he should have known of this famous work.

Boucicault afterwards revived The Vampire as The Phantom, and this was given in London with good applause. The American cast of the characters of The Phantom, ""As Produced at Wallack's Theatre, New York City,"" is as follows: In Act I (1645), The Phantom, Dion Boucicault; Lord Albert Clavering, Mr. J. B. Howe; Sir Hugh Neville of Graystock, Mr. Ralton; Sir Guy Musgrave, Mr. Etynge; Ralph Gwynne, Mr. Levere; Davy, Mr. T. B. Johnstone; Lucy Peveryl, Miss Agnes Robertson; Ellen, Miss Alleyne; Maud, Miss Ada Clare; Janet, Mrs. H. P. Grattan. In Act II (1750), Alan Raby, Dion Boucicault; Colonel Raby, Mr. Ralton; Edgar, his nephew, Mr. J. B. Howe; Dr. Rees, Mr. Burnett; Curate, Mr. Paul; Corporal Stump, Mr. Peters; Ada Raby, Miss Agnes Robertson; Jenny, Mrs. L. H. Allen.

Subsequently, I presume when The Phantom was given in London, some modifications were made which seem to me most decidedly to be improvements. The first act was placed in the latter part of the reign of Charles II, and two hundred years were supposed to elapse between the first and the second acts. This necessitated trifling changes in the dialogue at certain points; and naturally a complete alteration of costume to a modern style for Act II. In fact the script of the play which is printed in Dicks' Standard Plays, No. 697, (c. 1887) under ""Costume"" gives the following direction"": ""The costumes in the First Act are of the period of the latter part of the reign of Charles the Second. In the Second Art the respective characters are dressed in the provincial costume of Wales at the middle of the present century, The following description of Alan Raby's costume for each act will show the necessity of a complete change in the style of dress which this drama requires.

Alan Raby.--First Act: A Puritan's suit of black serge, bound with black velvet---cloak and breeches to match-black

p. 315

belt and buckle-black gauntlets---shirt collar thrown back so as to show the throat bare-black stockings-black velvet shoes with strap across the instep--black sugar-loaf hat and broad riband and steel buckle--phosphoric livid countenance--slightly bald head--long black lank hair combed behind the ears--bushy black eyebrows and heavy black moustache. 2nd dress: Black dress coat and overcoat of the same colour--black trousers--black waistcoat--black kid gloves, white wristbands over them--white cravat and black German hat--all modern, and such as would be worn by a gentleman at the present time."" In the theatre such a contrast would have proved very effective.

I notice that Boucicault has in certain scenes borrowed his situations pretty freely from Le Vampire of Dumas, and occasionally he has even conveyed actual dialogue from the French play.

At the commencement of The Phantom we are shown a room in a Welsh inn, and it appears that Davy and Janet the hostess have just been married. A sudden storm sends Lucy Peveryl thither for shelter, and she confides to Janet that she is on her way to meet at sundown her cousin Roland Peveryl, who is a fugitive and proscribed. On this account he dare not openly seek her hand, but the lovers are secretly betrothed. He has promised to meet her, in order to bid her farewell for a time, in the most unfrequented spot, the ruins of Raby Castle. No sooner does Janet hear that name than she cries out with horror, and speaks of a fearful story connected with the place. They are interrupted by the arrival of Lord Clavering with a party of guests, amongst whom are friends of Lucy. She frankly informs them of her rendezvous, and they decide to accompany her, more especially as the inn has not sufficient accommodation for the travellers, who resolve to take provisions and wine and spend the night in the deserted chambers of the old castle. Davy endeavours to prevent them, nor are his efforts altogether selfish. He tells them: ""No one ever sought a night's shelter in the ruins of Raby Castle, that ever lived to see the morning. . . . Within the ruins of Raby dwells some terrible thing--man or fiend! . . . No traveller that knows the road will ever venture near that spot after nightfall; but strange wayfarers, benighted in the storm have wandered to this place of shelter, and the next morning they are found--dead--each with a wound in his throat in the right side, from which they

p. 316

have evidently bled to death;--but no blood is spilt around, the face is white and fixed, as if it had died of horror."" ""And he, my betrothed,"" cries Lucy, ""Roland is there."" Nevertheless the company laugh at these old stories and determine to make their way to the old castle. This they actually find in far better state than they have been led to expect, and their servants who have insisted upon Davy showing them the way soon get a very fair supper from the provisions they have purchased at his inn. Roland Peveryl is not to be found, but whilst they are eating a stranger enters, a Puritan, and announces himself as Gervase Rookwood, a traveller who has lost his way in the mountains. Davy, however, almost collapses with terror. He recollects that many years before the castle belonged to Sir Owen Raby, a noble cavalier, while Alan Raby, his younger brother had joined the forces of Cromwell. Taking advantage of this difference the traitor one midnight with a band of Puritan soldiers surprises the castle, and butchers the sleeping garrison, killing his brother with his own hand. About a year later, however, the tables are turned, the Royalists recapture the place, Alan Raby is seized, and in their rage they hurl the fratricide from a window which hung shudderingly over a fearful precipice. Curiously enough no trace of the body could ever be recovered. But Davy recognizes that Gervase Rookwood is none other than Alan Raby. Here we have the old belief that a man guilty of some, monstrous crime, in this case rebellion against the King and the murder of a brother, is compelled to return as a vampire. When the company disperse to their various apartments for the night Lord Clavering is horrified to discover in his room the dead body of young Roland Peveryl, ""a wound deep in his throat, but bloodless."" At the same moment a piercing scream is heard and Lucy Peveryl rushing from her chamber with her hands wildly clasping her neck falls dead in Lord Clavering's arms. Seeing as he thinks a shadowy form that steals from her room he draws a pistol and fires. When the company hurry in with lights they discover Alan Raby has been shot. In faltering accents the dying man explains that hearing a cry for help he hastened to the lady's assistance. He will only forgive Lord Clavering on one condition. ""When I have breathed my last, let my body be conveyed amongst the peaks of Snowdon, and there exposed to the first rays of the rising

p. 317

moon which touch the earth."" This is done, and the first act concludes with a tableau of the peaks of Snowdon, whilst from behind the clouds there sails high in the heaven a silver sickle that strikes the corpse with her argent shaft of mystic light. The vampire wakes, and leaps to his feet crying in exultant tones: ""Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy thee!""

It cannot escape notice that in this act there are many parallels with Le Vampire of Dumas. Raby Castle is the Castle of Tormenar; Lucy Peveryl is Juana; Roland Peveryl, Don Luis de Figuerroa; Lord Clavering, Gilbert de Tiffauges; and Davy the gracioso Lazare.

Two centuries have flown. Raby Castle is now inhabited in possession of Colonel Raby, whose daughter is betrothed to her cousin Edgar. It has been falsely reported that this latter fell in battle, but the scene opens with his return. When the sad news first arrived Ada Raby was stricken almost to death, and, as they believed, actually died; but she was recalled to life by a mysterious stranger, since which hour she seems to, have fallen completely under his influence and in some extraordinary way only to respond to his power. This is none other than Gervase Rookwood, who now appears and informs Colonel Raby that he and none other is the lawful lord of Raby Castle. The Colonel's claim lies in the fact that when years before the last of the old Raby family, Sir Alan Raby died, or rather was killed, and no will could be found, the estate reverted to a distant branch of the Rabys, now represented by the Colonel. However, a document is produced in the handwriting of Alan Raby, his will, wherein he bequeaths the estate to Gervase Rookwood and the Rookwood successors. It seemed as though such a title cannot be resisted, but Doctor Rees, a scholar of occultism, is filled with the gravest suspicions of the stranger. In a ""Dictionary of Necromancy, a rare work by Dr. Dee,"" he has read of vampires, and he divines the demoniac nature of the pretended Rookwood. In a trancelike state Ada Raby has rejected Edgar and is to be given to the stranger, when Dr. Rees examining the documents discovers that the will of Sir Alan Raby, which must be some two hundred years old, although the hand is doubtless that of Raby as the archives prove, is written upon paper which has a watermark of 1850, ""scarcely five years old."" The vampire who

p. 318

endeavours to assassinate Edgar, is killed by a charmed bullet. Whilst his limbs relax in death the hypnotic spell vanishes from Ada's mind and she is united to her lover. But to their horror they notice that as the moonlight touches the body of Alan Raby where he has fallen, his members begin to twitch anew with life. Dr. Rees seizes the vampire and hurls the body into the darkest chasm of the mountain side, where no beam nor ray can ever penetrate or find the smallest chink of entrance.

The Phantom is, of course, somewhat old-fashioned and a little stilted, as was the mode, in its diction. No doubt some of the situations could be revised and far more neatly turned, yet on the whole I conceive that it should prove of its kind excellent fare in the theatre, and some scenes, at least, in capable hands were not without emotional appeal, I had almost said a certain impressiveness. Far worse dramas have (not undeservedly) earned their meed of approbation and applause.

On 15th August, 1872, was advertised: ""Royal Strand Theatre. Production of a Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, entitled 'The Vampire,' written by R. Reece."" There was indeed a bounteous bill of fare. At seven was given a farce, The Married Bachelor; at 7.30 Byron's Not Such a Fool as He Looks; ""At Half Past Nine the new and original Burlesque, a little Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, called The Vampire, written by R. Reece. The new Music by John Fitzgerald, the New Scenery Painted by H. P. Hall; Dresses by May, Mrs. Richardson and Assistants; Machinery by Wood; Properties by Ball. The Piece produced under the direction of Mrs. Swanborough, Mr. J. Wallace, and Mr. Reece."" The house, says the Era, 18th August, 1872, was crowded for this ""satirical burlesque."" His play, the author wrote, was founded upon ""a German legend, Lord Byron's story, and a Boucicaultian drama."" The Vampire, according to Reece, is a plagiarist who lives on other people's brains. The title rôle was acted by Edward Terry who kept the audience in roars of laughter. ""Mr. Terry's make-up as the Vampire was something extraordinary, and he worked with unflagging energy to add 'go' to the novelty."" During a picnic in the ruins of Raby Castle the Vampire endeavours to steal the note books of Ada Raby (Miss Emily Pitt) and Lady Audley Moonstone (Mrs. Raymond) two lady novelists, so that he may utilize their efforts for his weekly instalment of the ""penny dreadful"" and other fiction.

p. 319

He is attacked by the two lovers of the ladies, Lord Albert Clavering (Miss Bella Goodall) and Edgar (Miss Topsy Venn), and a good deal of broadest farce follows. ""The author was cordially greeted upon his appearance before the curtain, and the latest Strand burlesque may be noted as an undoubted success."" The Illustrated London News, 24th August, 1872, although very justly doubting the propriety of the subject as a theme for travesty highly praised Edward. Terry ""as the Hibernian plagiarist with the broadest of brogues and the most ghastly of faces."" As Allan Raby he haunts the ruins of Raby Castle, Raby Hall, and the Peak of Snowdon, seeking to filch the notebooks of tourists, ""from which he may gather materials for a three-volume novel which he has been engaged by a publisher to compose.""

On Monday, 27th September, 1909, at the Paragon Theatre was produced The Vampire, a ""two-scene sketch,"" adapted by Mr. José G. Levy from the French of Mme. C. le Vylars and Pierre Souvestre. ""It is a capitally written little piece conceived. in the grand Guignol vein;"" The Stage, 30th September, 1909. The first scene is Harry le Strang's smoking-room. Harry has been infatuated with a demi-mondaine named Sonia, who shot herself in a fit of remorse. The despairing lover is in communication with a Hindoo spiritualist Seratsih, who has evoked the spirit of the dead woman, now become a vampire and preying upon Harry's vitality and reason. An old friend, Jack Harlinger, in order as he thinks to save the situation persuades his own fiancée, Olga Kay, to personate the ghost of Sonia. The result is swift tragedy, for the maddened Harry le Strang shoots her dead destroying the vampire, whilst he himself falls at the revolver of Jack Harlingen Harry le Strang was played by Charles Hanbury; Jack Harlinger, Lauderdale Maitland; Seratsih, Clinton Barrett; and Olga Kay, Janet Alexander. The piece was very well received.

The Vampire, a Tragedy in Five Acts, by St. John Dorset (the Rev. Hugo John Belfour), Second Edition, 1821,[60] does not appear to have been acted. It was dedicated to W. G. Macready, Esq., whose kindness the author acknowledges in most grateful terms. The story is Oriental, the same being laid in Alexandria, and it is a ""moral"" vampire that is shown by the poet. In his ""advertisement"" he quotes a passage

from the Examiner, when noticing Planché's melodrama wrote: ""There are Vampires who waste the heart and happiness of those they are connected with, Vampires of avarice, Vampires of spleen, Vampires of debauchery, Vampires in all the shapes of selfishness and domestic tyranny."" This is his theme, and although his pages have considerable merit I do not conceive that his scenes would have been entirely successful on the stage, since they are poetical and reflective rather than dramatic,

In Germany sensational fiction was long largely influenced by Polidori, and we have such romances as Zschokke's Der tote Gast, Spindler's Der Vampyr und seine Braut, Theodor Hildebrand's Der Vampyr, oder die Totenbraut. Edwin Bauer's roman à clef the clever Der Baron Vampyr,"" which was published at Leipzig in 1846, hardly concerns as here, whilst Ewald August König's sensational Ein moderner Vampyr,[62] which appeared in 1883, or Franz Hirsch's Moderne Vampyr,[63] 1873, productions which only use in their titles the word ""Vampire"" to attract,--one might say, to ensnare attention, are in this connexion no more deserving of consideration than mere chap-books and pedlar's penny-ware such as Morelli's Der Vampyr, and Dr. Seltzam's pornographic Die Vampyre der Residenz.

Undoubtedly the vampire tradition has never been treated with such consummate skill as by Théophile Gautier in his exquisite prose poem La Morte Amoureuse, which first appeared in the Chronique de Paris on 23rd and 26th June, 1836, when the young author was not quite twenty-five. Although the theme is not original yet perhaps nowhere beside has it been so ingeniously moulded with such delicacy of style, with such rich and vivid colouring, with such emotion and such repression. The darker shadows of the tradition are suggested rather than portrayed, yet none can deny that there is an atmosphere of sombre mystery, even a touch of morbid horror which with complete artistry the writer allows us to suspect rather than to comprehend. The very vagueness of the relation adds to the illusion. We hardly know whether Romuald is the young country priest occupied in prayer and good works, or whether he is the Renaissance seignior living a life of passion and hot extravagance. As he himself cries: ""Sometimes I thought I was a priest who dreamed every night that be was a nobleman, sometimes that I was a nobleman who dreamed that he was a

p. 321

priest. I could no longer distinguish dreams from real life; I did not know where reality began and illusion ended. The dissolute, supercilious young lord jeered at the priest, and the priest abhorred the dissipations of the young lord."" But were he humble priest, or were he profligate patrician, one emotion remained eternally the same, his love for Clarimonde. At length the Abbé Serapion dissolves the glamour. Sternly he bids young Romuald accompany him to the deserted cemetery where Clarimonde lies buried; he exhumes the body, and as he sprinkles it with holy water it crumbles into dust. Then also has the lord Romuald gone for ever. There only remains the poor priest of God broken and alone, who grows old in an obscure parish in the depths of a wood, and who well-nigh half a century after scarcely dares to stir the ashes of that memory.

There are in English not a few stories which deal with the vampire tradition, and many of these are well imagined and cleverly contrived; the morbid horror of the thing has often been conveyed with considerable power, but yet it will, I think, be universally allowed that no author has written pages comparable to this story of Gautier. It is hardly to be disputed that the best of the English vampire stories is Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla, which the authorities upon the bibliography of this author[64] have not traced further back than its appearance in the collection entitled In A Glass Darkly, 1872,[65] Carmilla which is a story of some length, containing sixteen chapters, is exceedingly well told and it certainly exhibits that note of haunting dread which is peculiar to Le Fanu's work. The castle in Styria and the family who inhabit it are excellently done, nor will the arrival of Carmilla and the mysterious coach wherein sat ""a hideous black woman, with a sort of coloured turban on her head, who was gazing all the time from the carriage window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury,"" easily be forgotten.

It must suffice to mention very briefly but a few short stories in English where the vampire element is present. E. F. Benson has evoked real horror in his The Boom in the Tower and the horrible creature tangled in her rotting shroud all foul with mould and damp who returns from her accursed grave is loathly to the last degree.

The Flowering of the Strange Orchid, by H. G. Wells, introduces a botanical vampire. An orchid collector is found dead in a jungle in the Andaman Islands, with a strange bulb lying near him. This is brought to England and carefully tended by a botanist until it comes to flower. But when at last the blossoms burst open great tendrils suddenly reach out to grasp the man sucking his blood with hideous gusts. The unfortunate wretch has to be violently torn away from the plant which drips with blood scare e in time to save his life.

This idea closely resembles Fred M. White's story, The Purple Terror, which appeared in the Strand Magazine, September, 1899, Vol. xviii, No. 105. Here Lieutenant Will Scarlett, an American officer and a number of his men have to make their way across a certain tract of Cuban Territory. Spending the night in a country posada they are attracted by a pretty dancing girl who is wearing twined round her shoulders a garland of purple orchids larger than any known variety. The blossoms which a blood-red centre exhale a strange exotic perfume. Scarlett is fired with the enthusiasm of giving a new orchid to the horticultural world, and on the following morning a native, named Tito, undertakes to guide him to the spot. He learns that the natives call them ""the devil's poppies"" and that the flowers grow in the high trees where their blossoms cling to long green tendrils. As night falls the little company arrives at a plateau ringed by tall trees whose branches are crowned with great wreaths of the purple flower nestling amid coils of long green ropery. To their alarm they note that the ground is covered with bleaching bones, the skeletons of men, animals, and birds alike. Yet perforce they must camp there rather than risk the miasma of the lower valley. Scarlett keeps watch. In the darkness there is a rustling sound and suddenly a long green tendril furnished at the end with a sucker armed with sharp spines like teeth descends and snatches one of the men from the ground. As it is about to withdraw Scarlett with inconceivable swiftness slashes it through with his knife. But the man's clothing has even in that moment been cut through by the razor spines and his body is marked by a number of punctures where his blood is oozing in great drops. Immediately half-a-dozen and more lithe living cords with fanged mouths fall groping for their prey. The men are hurriedly awakened and with

p. 323

difficulty they extricate themselves by sending their whingers, ripping and tearing in every direction. It appears that the vampire poppies at night send down these tendrils to gather moisture. Anything which the fearful suckers can catch they drain dry, be it man or beast or bird. Lieutenant Scarlett and his men have been deliberately led into this trap by Tito, who is madly jealous of their compliments to Zara, the dancing-girl. They hold him prisoner and threaten him with condign punishment at headquarters.

Algernon Blackwood brings together two types of vampires in his story The Transfer. One is a human being, the psychic sponge, who absorbs and seems to live upon the vitality of others. He is thus described by the governess: ""I watched his hard, bleak face; I noticed how thin he was, and the curious oily brightness of his steady eyes. And everything he said or did announced what I may dare to call the suction of his presence."" There is also a yet more horrible monster, if one may term it so, the Forbidden Corner, an arid barren spot in the midst of the rose garden, naked and bald amid luxuriant growth. A child who knows its evil secret says: ""It's bad. It's hungry. It's dying because it can't get the food it wants. But I know what would make it feel right."" When the human vampire ventures near this spot it exerts its secret strength and draws him to itself. He falls into the middle of the patch and it drinks his energy. He lives on, but he seems to be nothing more than a physical husk or shell without vitality. As for the Forbidden Corner ""it lay untouched, full of great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong, full fed and bursting thick with life.""

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his little story, The Parasite, has depicted a human vampire or psychic sponge in the person of Miss Penelosa, who is described as being a small frail creature, ""with a pale peaky face, an insignificant presence and retiring manner."" Nevertheless she is able to obsess Professor Gilroy who says: ""She has a parasite soul, yes, she is a parasite; a monster parasite. She creeps into my form as the hermit crab creeps into the whelk's shell."" To his horror he realizes that under her influence his will becomes weaker and weaker and he is bound to seek her presence. He resists for a while, but the force becomes so overmastering that he is compelled to yield, loathing himself as he does so. When he visits her,

p. 324

with a terrific effort he breaks the spell and denounces her unhallowed fascination in burning words. However, his victory is short indeed. She persecutes him most bitterly, and when he unburdens his troubles to his college professor the only result is a prescription of chloral and bromide, which promptly goes into the gutter. With devilish craft the vampire destroys his reputation as a scholar, and brings about ill-natured gossip and comment. She is able to confuse his brain during his lectures, so that he talks unintelligible nonsense and his classes become the laughing-stock of the university, until at length the authorities are obliged to suspend him from his position. Almost in despair he cries: ""And the most dreadful part of it all is my loneliness. Here I sit in a commonplace English bow-window looking out upon a common-place English street, with its garish buses and its lounging policemen, and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place. In the home of knowledge I am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing. No magistrate would listen to me. No paper would discuss my case. No doctor would believe my symptoms. My own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement. I am out of all touch with my kind.""

The unfortunate victim is driven even deeper still by this unhallowed influence, which causes him to rob a bank, violently assault a friend, and finally to come within an ace of mutilating the features of his betrothed. At length the persecution ceases with the sudden death of the vampire, Miss Penelosa.

The True Story of a Vampire is a pathetic little story, very exquisitely told, in Studies of Death, by Stanislaus Eric, Count Stenbock, who wrote some verses of extraordinary charm in Love, Sleep, and Dreams; Myrtle, Rue, and Cypress; The Shadow of Death; and who at least once in The Other Side told a macabre legend with most powerful and haunting effect. A mysterious Count Vardaleh visits the remote styrian castle of old Baron Wronski, and before long attains an occult influence over the boy heir, Gabriel. The lad wastes away, and Count Vardaleh is heard to murmur: ""My darling, I fain would spare thee; but thy life is my life, and I must live, I who would rather die. Will God not have any mercy on me? Oh, oh! life; oh, the torture of life! . . . O Gabriel, my beloved! My life, yes, life--oh, my life? I am sure this is

p. 325

but a little I demand of thee. Surely the superabundance of life can spare a little to one who is already dead."" As the boy lies wan and ill, the Count enters the room and presses a long feverish kiss upon his lips. Vardaleh rushes forth, and can never be traced again. Gabriel has expired in the agony of that embrace.

In a novel, The Vampire, by Reginald Hodder, a woman who is the leader of an occult society is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire to prevent the ebbing of her vitality. Here her ravages are psychic rather than physical, albeit in fact the two so closely commingled that they are not to be separated. A curious feature in the tale is that this woman is represented as putting forth her energies through the medium of a metallic talisman, and various struggles to gain possession of the object form the theme of the story. It falls into the hands of persons who would employ it for evil purposes, when it constitutes a very formidable menace, but at the last after a number of extraordinary happenings it is happily recovered.

The traditional, but yet more horrible vampire is presented to us by F. Marion Crawford in For the Blood Is the Life. Here a young man, who has been loved by a girl whose affection he was unable to return, is after her death vampirised by her, and when his friends suspect the truth they determine to rescue him. They find him upon her grave, a thin stream of blood trickling from his throat. ""And the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked up from the feast,--upon two deep, dead eyes that saw in spite of death--upon parted lips redder than life itself--upon gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop."" The situation is effectively dealt with according to the good old tradition. A hawthorn stake is driven through the heart of the vampire who emits a quantity of blood and with a despairing shriek dies the last death.

Almost equally vivid in its details must be accounted the tale, Four Wooden Stakes, by Victor Roman. The ghastly events in the lonely old house with its little grey crypt, some ten miles from the small town of Charing, a place of not more than fifteen hundred souls, are most vividly described. There lived the Holroyds, the grandfather, the father, and three brothers. Whilst in South America the grandfather ""was

p. 326

attacked while asleep by one of those huge bats. Next morning he was so weak be couldn't walk. That awful thing had sucked his life blood away. He arrived here, but was sickly until his death, a few weeks later."" So says Remson Holroyd, who is left the sole survivor of the family, and who has summoned his old college friend to help him solve the secret of the hideous doom which is taking toll one by one. The grandfather was not buried in the usual way; but, as his will directed, his remains were interred in the vault built near the house. Remson Holroyd continues: ""Then my dad began failing and just pined away until he died. What puzzled the doctors was the fact that right up until the end he consumed enough food to sustain three men, yet he was so weak he lacked the strength to drag his legs over the floor. He was buried, or rather interred with grand-dad. The same symptoms were in evidence in the cases of George and Fred. They are both lying in the vault. And now, Jack, I'm going, too, for of late my appetite has increased to alarming proportions, yet I am as weak as a kitten."" The next morning the visitor finds himself so weak that he is hardly able to rise and he feels a slight pain in the neck. ""I rushed to examine it in the mirror. Two tiny dots rimmed with blood--my blood--and on my neck! No longer did I chuckle at Remson's fears, for it, the thing, had attacked me--as I slept."" The host himself is in a state of utter exhaustion. That night watch is kept by the friend, and as from his concealment he is gazing into Remson's room he notices ""a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows. It apparently emanated from nowhere. Hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light, and as I watched them fascinated, they seemed to take oil the form of a human face. The features were masculine, as was also the arrangement of the hair. Then the mysterious glow disappeared."" After a few moments there appears a vague form of which the watcher is able to distinguish the head, and to his horror he sees that the features are the same as those of a portrait of the grandfather which is hanging in the picture gallery of the house. ""But oh, the difference in expression! The lips were drawn back in a snarl, disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth, the canines over developed and remarkably sharp. The eyes, an emerald green in colour, stared in a look of consuming hate."" The horror is revealed. The house is infested by a vampire. In the morning

p. 327

the two friends visit the vault. ""As if by mutual understanding, we both turned toward the coffin on our left. It belonged to the grandfather. We unplaced the lid, and there lay the old Holroyd. He appeared to be sleeping; his face was full of colour, and he had none of the stiffness of death. The hair was matted, the moustache untrimmed, and on the beard were matted stains of a dull brownish hue. But it was his eyes that attracted me. They were greenish, and they glowed with an expression of fiendish malevolence such as I had never seen before. The look of baffled rage on the face might well have adorned the features of the devil in hell."" They drive a stake through the living corpse, which shrieks and writhes, whilst the gushing blood drenches coffins and floor spurting out in great jets over the very walls. The head is severed from the body, and as the final stroke of the knife cut the connexion a scream issued from the mouth; and the whole corpse fell away into dust, leaving nothing but a wooden stake lying in a bed of bones."" The remaining three bodies are treated in the same way, and thus the thrall of the curse is lifted from the old house, ten miles from the little town of Charing.

Although the genius of Charles Baudelaire, when his art required it, shrank from no extremity of physical horror, yet in his exquisite poem Le Vampire he has rather portrayed the darkness and desolation of the soul:

Toi qui, comme un coup de couteau,
Dans mon coeur plaintif est entrée;
Toi qui, forte comme un troupeau
De démons, vins, folle et parée.

De mon esprit humilié
Faire ton lit et ton domaine
--Infâme a qui je suis lié
Comme le forcat a la chaîne,

Comme au jeu le joueur têtu,
Comme à la bouteille l'ivrogne,
Comme aux vermines la charogne,
--Maudite, maudite sois-tu!

J'ai prié le glaive rapide
De conquerir ma liberté
Et j'ai dit au poison perfide
De secourir ma lâcheté.

p. 328

Helas! le poison et le glaive
M'ont pris en dédain et m'ont dit
Tu n'es pas digne qu'on t'enlève
A ton esclavage maudit.

Imbécile!--de son empire
Si nos efforts te délivraient,
Tes baisers ressusciteraient
Le cadavre de ton vampire!

In England there is a poem--truly of a very different kind--which appears in the life of the famous scientist, James Clerk Maxwell, by Lewis Campbell and William Garnett, verses written by Maxwell in 1845 when he was fourteen Years of age. The verses should not perhaps, because of the youth of the author, be criticized too sharply, and although they show Wardour Street fustian and gimcrack, since the piece is of no great length it may pardonably be quoted here. It is not entirely without a certain feeling after the right atmosphere, and much will be forgiven on account of the precocity. It is grandiosely entitled The Vampyre: Compylt into Meeter by James Clerk Maxwell.""

Thair is a knichte rydis through the wood,
And a douchty knichte is hee.
And sure bee is on a message sent,
He rydis sae hastilie.
He passit the aik, and hee passit the birk,
And bee passit monie a tre,
Bot plesant to him was the saugh sae slim,
For beneath it hee did see
The boniest ladye that ever hee saw,
Scho was sae schyn and fair.
And thair scho sat, beneath the saugh,
Kaiming hir gowden hair.
And then the knichte--""Oh ladye brichte,
What chance has broucht you here?
But sae the word, and ye schall gang
Back to your kindred dear,""
Then up and spok the ladye fair--
""I have nae friends or kin,
Bot in a little boat I live,
Amidst the waves' loud din.""
Then answered thus the douchty knichte""
I'll follow you through all,
For gin ye bee in a littel boat,
The world to it seemis small."" p. 329
They goed through the wood, and through the wood,
To the end of the wood they came:
And when they came to the end of the wood
They saw the salt sea faem.
And when they saw the wee, wee boat,
That daunced on the top of the wave,
And first got in the ladye fair,
And then the knichte sae brave.
They got into the wee, wee boat
And rowed wi' a' their micht
When the knichte sae brave, he turnit about,
And lookit at the ladye bricht
He lookit at her bonnie cheik,
And bee lookit at hir twa bricht eyne,
Bot hir rosie cheik growe ghaistly pale,
And schoe seymit as scho deid had been.
The fause, fause knichte growe pale with frichte.
And his hair rose up on end,
For gane-by days cam to his mynde,
And his former love he kenned.
Then spake the ladye--""Thou, fause knichte,
Hast done to me much ill,
For didst forsake me long ago,
Bot I am constant still:
For though I ligg in the woods sae cald,
At rest I canna bee
Until I sucks the gude lyfe blude
Of the man that gart me dee.""
Hee saw hir lipps were wet wi' blude,
And hee saw hir lufolesse eyne,
And loud bee cry'd, ""get frae my syde,
Thou vampyr corps encleane!""
But no, bee is in hir magic boat,
And on the wyde, wyde sea;
And the vampyr suckis his gude lyfe blude,
Sho suckis him till hee dee.
So now beware, whoe'er you are,
That walkis in this lone wood:
Beware of that deceitfull spright,
The ghaist that suckis the blude.

The Vampire Bride, a ballad by the Hon. Henry Liddell, has considerable merit, It may be found in The Wizard of the North, The Vampire Bride, and other Poems, Blackwood, Edinburgh, and Cadell, London, 1833. These stanzas are founded upon the old tale of the knight who having placed a ring--some say his wedding-ring--around the finger of the statue of Venus whilst he is a quoiting, when he would reclaim it

p. 330

finds that the finger is crooked so that the jewel may not be withdrawn, whilst that night a phantom claims him as her spouse. With difficulty is he freed from the thrall of the succubus.

In 1845 there was published at the Columbian Press Weston-super-mare, a little book entitled The Last of the Vampires, by Smyth Upton. The chief, some critics might say the only, merit of this tale is its excessive rarity. The narrative is somewhat curiously divided into Epochs, the first of which takes place in 1769, the second in 1777, the third and last in 1780. Chapter I opens in an English village named Frampton, but in Chapter II ""we find ourselves upon the borders of Bohemia"" in the Castle Von Oberfels. Four chapters of no great length and somewhat disconnected in their sequence comprise the First Epoch. A little later we meet with the mysterious Lord de Montfort, and apparently he has just committed a murder, since he is one of the two men who stand in a dreary outhouse adjoining Montfort Abbey. ""Red blood, yet warm, stains their murderous hands, and is seen also in pools upon the floor; the same marks are observable, also, on their clothes."" ""The scene is a fearful one; it is one of those of which the mere recital makes the blood run cold,"" and the writer wisely does not attempt the task. In the penultimate chapter of this extraordinary production we are introduced to ""a certain young German, the Baron Von Oberfels,"" who weds Mary Learmont, the elder daughter of ""Sir James Learmont, who being a Baronet, was, moreover, a Knight of the Bath and M.P."" Unfortunately the Baron ""was one of that horrible class, the Vampires! He had sold his soul to the evil one, for the enjoyment of perpetual youth; being bound, besides, to what are understood to be the penalties of that wretched and accursed race. Every tenth year a female was sacrificed to his infernal master. Mary Learmont was to be the next victim; may she escape the threatened doom."" But apparently, so far as I can gather, she is not so lucky for we are vaguely told ""The Baron and his bride departed on his wedding tour. Her father and mother never hear of her more."" A page or two later there is ""a midnight wedding"" at the Castle Von Oberfels. Of the bride we are told nothing save that she had a ""fair presence."" ""The Baron Von Oberfels was there, once more arrayed in the

p. 331

garments of a bridegroom."" The ceremony proceeds. The grand organ peals; the heavenly voices of white-robed choristers added greatly to the beauty of the scene. ""But hark! another noise is heard; sulphureous smoke half fills the sacred building; the floor opens for an instant; and mocking shrieks are audible as the spirit of the Last of the Vampires descended into perdition.""

I am bound to acknowledge that after a somewhat careful reading of this curious and most disjointed little piece of seventy-six pages the only impression with which I am met is that Mr. Smyth Upton knew nothing whatsoever of what the word vampire connotes. The idea of the victims who are sacrificed for the sake of eternal youth is, of course fairly common and was very effectively utilized by G. W. M. Reynolds in his romance The Necromancer, which ran in Reynolds's Miscellany from Saturday, 27th December, 1851, to Saturday, 31st July, 1852.[66] Incidentally it maybe remarked as a somewhat curious fact that this prolific novelist never availed himself of the vampire tradition in his melodramatic chapters.

The Vampyre. ""By the Wife of a Medical Man,"" 1858, is a, violent teetotal tract, of twenty-seven short chapters presented in the guise of fiction. The villain of the piece is ""The Vampyre Inn,"" and the dipsomaniac hero--if it be allowable to use the term in such a context--is given to ravings such as these: ""They fly--they bite--they suck my blood--I die. That hideous 'Vampyre!' Its eyes pierce me thro'--they are red--they are bloodshot. Tear it from my pillow. I dare not lie down. It bites--I die! Give me brandy--brandy--more brandy.""

A Vampire of Souls, by H. M. P., published in 1904, is a book of little value. The hero, George Ventnor, when aged twenty, is killed in a railway accident, and the narrative consists of his after experiences which are singularly material and crude. There is, perhaps, a good touch here and there, but the thing certainly does not deserve to be rescued from oblivion.

It will have been noticed that beyond the titles these two last works have really little or nothing to do with vampires at all, but we may now consider a romance which may at least be ranked as a very serious rival to--in my opinion it is far ghostlier than--its famous successor Dracula. Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, is undoubtedly the best novel

p. 332

of Thomas Preskett Prest, a prolific writer of the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century. It is true that his productions published by the well-known Edward Lloyd, of 231, Shoreditch,[67] may be classed as simple ""shockers,"" but none the less he has considerable power in this kind, and he had at any rate the craft of telling his story with skill and address. There is a certain quality in his work, which appeared during the years from 1839 to the earlier fifties, that is entirely lacking in the productions of his fellows. To him have been ascribed, doubtless with some exaggeration, well nigh two hundred titles, but the following list comprises, I believe, his principal romances: Ela, the Outcast, or, the Gipsy of Rosemary Dell; Angelina, or, the Mystery of S. Mark's Abbey, ""a Tale of Other Days ""; The Death Grasp, or, A Father's Curse; Ernnestine De Lacy, or, The Robbers' Foundling; Gallant Tom, or, The Perils of a Sailor Ashore and Afloat, ""an original nautical romance of deep and pathetic interest ""; Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (the most famous of Prest's novels); Newgate (which has some capital episodes); Emily Fitzormond; Mary Clifford; The Maniac Father, or, The Victim of Seduction; Gertrude of the Rock; Rosalie, or, The Vagrant's Daughter; The Miller's Maid; Jane Brightwell; Blanche, or, The Mystery of the Doomed House; The Blighted Heart, or, The Priory Ruins; Sawney Bean, the Man-eater of Midlothian; The Skeleton Clutch, or, The Goblet of Gore; The Black Monk, or, The Secret of the Grey Turret[68]; The Miller and His Men, or, The Secret Robbers of Bohemia. To Prest also has been attributed, but I conceive without foundation, Susan Hoply, an audacious piracy upon the famous novel by Mrs. Crowe, Susan Hopley.

Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, was first published in 1847. It contains no less than CCXX chapters and runs to 868 pages. The many incidents succeed each other with such breathless rapidity that it were well-nigh impossible to attempt any conspectus of the whole romance. The very length would make this analysis a work of extreme difficulty, and incidentally we may note the amazing copiousness of Prest which must ever remain a matter for wonderment. Such a romance, for example, as Newgate runs to no less than on, hundred and forty-nine chapters comprising 772 pages. The Maniac Father has fifty-four chapters, each of considerable

p. 333

length, which total 604 pages, and I have not selected these on account of their exceptional volume.

Varney the Vampire was among the most popular of Prest's productions, and on account of its ""unprecedented success"" it was reprinted in 1853 in penny parts. To-day the book is unprocurable and considerable sums have been for many years in vain offered to secure a copy. Indeed, it may be noted that all Prest's work is excessively scarce.

It is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that of recent years there have been few books which have been more popular than Brain Stoker's Dracula, A tale, and certainly there is no sensational romance which in modern days has achieved so universal a reputation. Since it was first published in 1897, that is to say one and twenty years ago, it has run into a great number of editions, and the name has veritably become a household word. It will prove interesting to inquire into the immediate causes which have brought this book such wide and enduring fame. It has already been remarked that it is well-nigh impossible for a story which deals with the supernatural or the horrible to be sustained to any great length. Elements which at first are almost unendurable, will lose their effect if they are continued, for the reader's mind insensibly becomes inured to fresh emotions of awe and horror, and Dracula is by no means briefly told. In the ordinary reprints (Tenth Edition, 1913) it extends to more than four hundred pages, nor does it escape the penalty of its prolixity. The first part, ""Jonathan Harker's Journal,"" which consists of four chapters is most admirably done, and could the whole story have been sustained at so high a level we should have had a complete masterpiece. But that were scarcely possible. The description of the journey through Transylvania is interesting to a degree, and even has passages which attain to something like charm. ""All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear."" Very effective is the arrival of the English traveller at the ""vast ruined castle, from, whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose

p. 334

broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky."" Very adroitly are the various incidents managed in their quick succession, those mysterious happenings which at last convince the matter-of-fact commonplace young solicitor of Exeter that he is a helpless prisoner in the power of a relentless and fearful being. The continual contrasts between business conversations, the most ordinary events of the dull listless days, and all the while the mantling of dark shadows in the background and the onrushing of some monstrous doom are in these opening chapters most excellently managed.

So tense a strain could not be preserved, and consequently when we are abruptly transported to Whitby and the rather tedious courtships of Lucy Westenra, who is a lay figure at best, we feel that a good deal of the interest has already begun to evaporate. I would hasten to add that before long it is again picked up, but it is never sustained in the same degree; and good sound sensational fare as we have set before us, fare which I have myself more than once thoroughly enjoyed, yet it is difficult not to feel that one's palate, has been a little spoiled by the nonpareil of an antipast. This is not to say that the various complications are not sufficiently thrilling, but because of their very bounty now and again they most palpably fail of effect, and it can hardly escape notice that the author begins to avail himself of those more extravagant details of vampirism which frankly have no place outside the stories told round a winter's hearth, It would have been better had he confined himself to those particulars which are known and accepted, which indeed have been officially certified and definitely proved. But to have limited himself thus would have meant the shortening of his narrative, and here we return to the point which was made above.

If we review Dracula from a purely literary point of approach it must be acknowledged that there is much careless writing and many pages could have been compressed and something revised with considerable profit. It is hardly possible to feel any great interest in the characters, they are labels rather than individuals. As I have said, there are passages of graphic beauty, passages of graphic horror, but these again almost entirely occur within the first sixty pages. There are some capital incidents, for example the method by which Lord p. 335 Godalming and his friend obtain admittance to No. 347 Piccadilly. Nor does this by any means stand alone.

However, when we have--quite fairly, I hope--thus criticized Dracula, the fact remains that it is a book of unwonted interest and fascination. Accordingly we are bound to acknowledge that the reason for the immense popularity of this romance, the reason why, in spite of obvious faults it is read and re-read--lies in the choice of subject and for this the author deserves all praise.

It might not have seemed that Dracula would have been a very promising subject for the stage, but nevertheless it was dramatized by Hamilton Deans and produced at the Wimbledon Theatre on 9th March, 1925. This version was performed in London at the Little Theatre, 14th February, 1927. On the preceding Thursday the Daily Mirror published a photograph of the late Mr. Brain Stoker accompanied by the following paragraphs. ""Herewith, one of the very few photographs of the late Brain Stoker, who, besides being Sir Henry Irving's manager for years, was an industrious novelist. As I have already said, a dramatic version of his most famous book, 'Dracula,' is to be done at the Little on Monday, and the scene of the Grand Guignol plays is appropriate, for the new piece, I hear, is so full of gruesome thrills that, in the provinces women having been carried fainting from the auditorium. Truly we take our pleasures sadly.

""The dramatic adaptation is by Hamilton Deans, whose grandfather, Colonel Deans, and the Rev. Abraham Stoker, Bram's father, lived on adjoining estates in County Dublin. Young Bram and Hamilton Deane's mother, then a young girl, were great friends. Stoker had the book 'Dracula' in his mind, and the young people used to discuss its possibilities. Strange that it should be young Hamilton Deane who has dramatized the book and brought the play to London.""

At the Little Theatre the cast of Dracula was as follows: Count Dracula, Raymond Huntley; Abraham van Helsing, Hamilton Deane; Dr. Seward, Stuart Lomath; Jonathan Harker, Bernard Guest; Quincey P. Morris, Frieda Hearn; Lord Godalming, Peter Jackson; R. M. Renfield, Bernard Jukes; The Warden, Jack Howarth; The Parlourmaid, Hilda Macleod; The Housemaid, Betty Murgatroyd; Mina Harker, Dora Mary Patrick.

p. 336

By no stretch could it be called a good play, whilst the presentation, at the best, can hardly be described as more than reasonably adequate. In one or two instances the effects, upon which so much depends and which obviously demanded the most scrupulous care, were so clumsily contrived as to excite an involuntary smile. ""It was only a step from the devilish to the ridiculous on Monday night,"" said the Era, 16th February, 1927. Very remarkable was a lady, dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse who sat in the vestibule of the theatre, and it was bruited that her services were required by members of the audience who were overcome owing to the horrors of the drama. I can only say that I find this canard impossible to believe, quodcumque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi. As an advertisement, and it can surely have been nothing else, the attendance of a nurse was in deplorable taste. I am informed that after the first few weeks a kind of epilogue was spoken when all the characters were assembled upon the stage, and it was explained that the audience must not be distressed at what they had seen, that it was comically intended for their entertainment. So gross a lapse of good manners, not to speak of the artistic indecorum, is hardly credible.[69]

Confessedly the play was extremely weak, and yet such is the fascination of this subject that it had an exceptional success, and triumphantly made its way from theatre to theatre. On 25th July, 1927, Dracula was transferred to the Duke of York's; on the 29th August, following to the Prince of Wales, on 10th October to the Garrick; and all the while it was given to thronging houses. It has also toured, and at the present moment is still touring the provincial theatres with the most marked success, the drama being given with more spirit and vigour than originally was the case at the Little, and Wilfrid Fletcher in particular playing the lunatic Renfield with a real touch of wistful pathos and uncanny horror. This is is extremely instructive, and it is curious that the vogue of the ""vampire play"" in London should be repeated almost exactly after the interval of a century. On 5th November, 1927, a new version of Dracula by Charles Morrel was presented at the Court Theatre, Warrington.

In America the dramatization of Dracula was produced at the Shubert, New Haven, 19th September, 1927. This was given at the Fulton, New York, upon the following 5th October.

p. 337

Jonathan Harker was acted by Terence Neil; Abraham Van Helsing by Edward Van Sloan; Renfield by Bernard Jukes; and Count Dracula by Bela Lugoni .

As I have before remarked, the striking fact that an indifferent play should prove so successful can, I think, only be attributed to the fascination of the theme. Consciously or unconsciously it is realized that the vampire tradition contains far more truth than the ordinary individual cares to appreciate and acknowledge. ""La fable du vampire est peut-être, la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . . Elle a partout l'autorité de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de cello de la philosophic ni de celle de la médicine. La théologie même en a parlé.""",Montague Summers,1961,"[70, 66, 56, 49, 53, 61, 71, 88]",8

Quando vorrei dormire all'alba delle sei
Linda mi tiene sveglio, niente buenas noches
Dovrei lasciarla, porta solo guai

Di partire per non ritornare mai e lasciarci tutti dietro

261,My Blue Heaven,"[Verse 1]
Two sides twist and then collide
You're calling off the guards (Am I coming?)
I'm coming through (Am I coming?)
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)

[Chorus]
And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

[Verse 2]
Dull heat rises from the sheets
I'm both a patient boy
Well, and a jealous man (Am I coming?)
My double standardized suspicion
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven
Sometimes, it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)

[Chorus]
And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime

As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing

Coming through?

Is this all too familiar?
Does it happen all the time?

Could you please, just once, just hear me?

262,A Little Dog Cried,"Victor was a little baby,
Into this world he came;
His father took him on his knee and said:
'Don't dishonour the family name.'

Victor looked up at his father
Looked up with big round eyes:
His father said; 'Victor, my only son,
Don't you ever ever tell lies.'

Victor and his father went riding
Out in a little dog-cart;
His father took a Bible from his pocket and read;
'Blessed are the pure in heart.'

It was a frosty December
It wasn't the season for fruits;
His father fell dead of heart disease
While lacing up his boots.

It was a frosty December
When into his grave he sank;
His uncle found Victor a post as cashier
In the Midland Countries Bank.

It was a frosty December
Victor was only eighteen,
But his figures were neat and his margins were straight
And his cuffs were always clean.

He took a room at the Peveril,
A respectable boarding-house;
And Time watched Victor day after day
As a cat will watch a mouse.

The clerks slapped Victor on the shoulder;
'Have you ever had woman?' they said,
'Come down town with us on Saturday night.'
Victor smiled and shook his head.

The manager sat in his office,
Smoked a Corona cigar;
Said: 'Victor's a decent fellow but
He's too mousy to go far'.

Victor went up to his bedroom,
Set the alarum bell;
Climbed into bed, took his Bible and read
Of what happened to Jezebel.

It was the First of April,
Anna to the Peveril came;
Her eyes, her lips, her breasts, her hips
And her smile set men aflame.

She looked as pure as a schoolgirl
On her First Communion day,
Both her kisses were like the best champagne
When she gave herself away.

It was the Second of April,
She was wearing a coat of fur;
Victor met her upon the stairs
And he fell in love with her.

The first time he made his proposal,
She laughed, said 'I'll never wed';
The second time there was a pause,
Then she smiled and shook her head.

Anna looked into her mirror,
Pouted and gave a frown;
Said: 'Victor's as dull as a wet afternoon
But I've got to settle down.'

The third time he made his proposal,
As they walked by the Reservoir,
She gave him a kiss like a blow on the head,
Said: 'You are my heart's desire.'

They were married early in August,
She said: 'Kiss me, you funny boy';
Victor took her in his arms and said:
'O my Helen of Troy.'

It was the middle of September,
Victor came to the office one day;
He was wearing a flower in his buttonhole,
He was late but he was gay.

The clerks were talking of Anna,
The door was just ajar,
One said: 'Poor old Victor, but where ignorance
Is bliss, etcetera.'

Victor stood still as a statue,
The door was just ajar;
One said: 'God, what fun I had with her
In that Baby Austin car.'

Victor walked out into the High Street.
He walked to the edge of town;
He came to the allotments and the rubbish heaps
And his tears came tumbling down.

Victor looked up at the mountains,
The mountains all covered with snow;
Cried: 'Are you pleased with me, Father?'
And the answer came back, 'No.'

Victor came to the forest,
Cried: 'Father, will she ever be true?'
And the oaks and the beeches shook their heads
And they answered: 'Not to you.'

Victor came to the meadow
Where the wind went sweeping by;
Cried: 'O, Father, I love her so',
But the wind said: 'She must die.'

Victor came to the river
Running so deep and so still;
Crying: 'O Father, what shall I do?'
And the river answered: 'Kill.'

Anna was sitting at table,
Drawing cards from a pack;
Anna was sitting at table
Waiting for her husband to come back.

It wasn't the Jack of Diamonds
Not the joker she drew first;
It wasn't the King or Queen of Hearts
But the Ace of Spades reversed.

Victor stood in the doorway,
He didn't utter a word;
She said: 'What's the matter, darling?'
He behaved as if he hadn't heard.

There was a voice in his left ear,
There was a voice in his right,
There was a voice at the base of his skull
Saying: 'She must die tonight.'

Victor picked up a carving-knife,
His features were set and drawn,
Said: 'Anna, it would have been better for you
If you had not been born.'

Anna jumped up from the table,
Anna started to scream,
But Victor came slowly after her
Like a horror in a dream.

She dodged behind the sofa,
She tore down a curtain rod,
But Victor followed her up the stairs
And he caught her at the top.

He stood there above the body,
He stood there holding the knife;
And the blood ran down the stairs and sang:
'I'm the Resurrection and the Life.'

They tapped Victor on the shoulder,
They took him away in a van;
He sat as quite as a lump of moss
Saying: 'I am the Son of Man.'

Victor sat in a corner
Making a woman of clay,
Saying: 'I am Alpha and Omega, I shall come
To judge the earth some day.'",W. H. Auden,1961,"[73, 71, 79, 83]",4
263,I Don't Like It Like That,"Everyone Stares
Asks me where they can find it
I’m shaking where I am
I don’t want them to know

But I must answer
I don’t know why
Is it unwanted attention
Or being recognized

I can’t realize
Why I’m afraid
Will people talk about me
Behind My Back?

I just wanted to share
What I believe in
And if people don’t see what I see
They’ll point their weapons right at me

If I have to explain
What will they label her as
They’ve called her what she isn’t
In the past

And if I explain it
Will they make fun of
My life decisions
And everything else I’ve done?

I can’t realize
Why I’m afraid
Will people talk about me
Behind My Back?

I just wanted to share
What I believe in
And if people don’t see what I see
They’ll point their weapons right at me

If the world accepts who I am
And what I say
Can this album change the ones
Who thought the opposite before?

Should I be the brave
And go on with whatever
Happens to me after this?

Everyone around
Let's jump and shout
For What Life Really Means

I can’t realize
Why I’m afraid
Will people talk about me
Behind My Back?

The jukebox blowing a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm

I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rolling arthritis
Sitting down at a rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven

Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over then move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock with
One another
Roll over Beethoven

Well, early in the morning I'm giving you my warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I'ma play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
You oughta see him reel and rock
Long as she got a dime, the music won't never stop

Memories of June
Haunt me tonight
While I'm looking through
My precious summer souvenirs
Trinkets that we won
In boardwalk games
Tintypes that were done
In painted frames
They all speak of you
My precious summer souvenirs
I still have banners from the boat we boarded
When we sailed across the bay
Songs your favorite band recorded
I have hoarded away
Leaves are on the ground
There'll soon be frost
Someone else has found
The love I lost
Still I'm clinging to

Distant from me

As close as can be

Wonderfully wise
Let me be seen
By his faraway eyes

When I am near
When I am near
Couldn't he be more
Aware that I'm here

We're holding hands
Inches apart
Show me the way
To his faraway heart

To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can’t hear you anymore
I’m a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 4]
So long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I’ll just say fare thee well

Sorry, I ain't never touched nobody?

Probably laugh cah this beater small
If I slap at your face, badman, it will hurt ya
Yo, your olders should get their license
Crashing cars on scooters, you're a learner

Young age when I stepped with the wap
Didn't think twice, just gripped on the mash
Lean out the ride or I Jump Out Gang

Jump Out Gang, watch bro double tap
Slap this wap, watch you Migraine Skank

Hiding, where's Lampost? Can't find him

We slide on man, we move like assassins
Stop this whip, hold corn in your fabric
Chill on your block, no doubt we're attacking

Back this wap and of course I'm slapping
You don't wanna buck bro excited
Bro get 'round, that's mileage
Dip him, knife him, hop back in

Beef with tongues and internet typers
Don't ride back when your friends get knifed in

Start of the year got nicked for a M
No comment officer, all the way to the end
Lil Jojo better cover his lense

I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Let’s go

[Chorus]
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train
Let’s go listen to the night train

About a mile off Old Mill Road

We can live a love together

A CADILLAC SEVILLE pulls up to the valet area and CAMERA (STEADICAM) moves across the street, towards the car, landing close;

From the Seville steps, JACK HORNER (50s) and AMBER WAVES (early 30s).
CAMERA follows them (this is one continous shot) as they pass the crowd,

MAURICE

JACK

Maurice takes Amber's hand and gives it a kiss.

MAURICE

You are the foxiest bitch in ten countries.

AMBER

You're such a charmer.

MAURICE

(to Jack)

I got you all set up at your booth.

I wanna send over some clams on the half shell.

JACK

Beautiful.

MAURICE

Just remember, Jack: I'm available

and ready. Cast me and find out --

JACK

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Amber and Jack head off towards the booth. CAMERA stays with Maurice,
follows him to the bar area, where he shouts some orders to a WAITER.

MAURICE

Clams on the half shell to Jack

and Amber -- over there -- go!

The WAITER takes off to the kitchen, Maurice walks onto the dance floor and
greets three people;

REED ROTHCHILD, 20s, tall and skinny, BECKY BARNETT, 20s, black girl in
silk, BUCK SWOPE, 20s, black guy in cowboy gear.

MAURICE

Hello there, kiddies.

MAURICE

Great, great, great.

Maurice moves away to greet some more people. CAMERA stays with Reed, Becky
and Buck, does a 360 around them. Reed and Becky Disco Dance. Buck does
some Cowboy-Type Moves.

Moments later, the WAITER carrying clams on the half shell passes and
CAMERA picks up with him, follows him to Jack's booth, where he presents
them;

WAITER

Compliments of Maurice.

JACK

Thank you.

AMBER

Can I get a Marguerita, please?

JACK

Seven-Up, here --

The WAITER exits, CAMERA PANS with him for a moment, leading to a young
girl wearing rollerskates, ROLLERGIRL (aged 18). She always, always wears
rollerskates. CAMERA PANS with her back to Jack's booth.

ROLLERGIRL

Hi.

JACK

Hello, honey.

AMBER

(to Rollergirl)

Did you call that girl today?

ROLLERGIRL

I forgot.

AMBER

If you don't do it tomorrow, then it's

the weekend and you'll never be able to

get in to see her --

ROLLERGIRL

OK.

Rollergirl scratches her crotch as she speaks. Amber notices;

AMBER

What's the matter down there?

ROLLERGIRL

I gotta go pee.

AMBER

Well go, then.

CAMERA stays with Rollergirl, following her across the dance floor. She
passes Buck, Becky and Reed, says hello, dances a moment, then continues on
-- into the clearing off the dance floor, heading for the bathroom. She
passes something, CAMERA moves away towards this something:

A bus boy cleaning a table, EDDIE ADAMS, aged 17. CAMERA moves into a CU --
blending to SLOW MOTION (40fps) for a moment.

(Note: In the text Eddie Adams will be referred to as Dirk Diggler.)

ANGLE, JACK'S TABLE.

Jack turns his head, looks across the dance floor and sees this kid
cleaning the table.

ANGLE, DIRK DIGGLER.

He looks up, catches Jack looking back at him, then turns away, disappears
into a back room.

CAMERA DOLLIES in on Jack, who at that moment, is approached by a figure
entering FRAME. Short, buffed out LITTLE BILL (late 40s). This is Jack's
Assistant Director.

JACK

I wanna do it the day after

heads away.

JACK

I wanna keep a small crew on this one --

nearby.

BUCK

-- so basically you're gettin'

twice the base, cause of the TK421

modification we got in this system here.

CUSTOMER

I don't know - do I need that much bass?

BUCK

If you want a system to handle

what you want -- yes you do.

See this system here. This is Hi-Fi.

""High Fidelity."" What that means is

that it's the highest quality fidelity.

CUSTOMER

It's the price --

BUCK

I have this unit at home.

CUSTOMER

. . . really . . . ?

BUCK

Yes. But -- I've got it modified

with the TK421, which is a bass unit

that basically kicks in another two,

maybe three quads when you really

crank -- lemme put another eight track

in so you can get a better idea what

I'm talkin about --

Buck ejects the Eight Track that was playing and puts in his own of a
country western song.

BUCK

Hear that bass? It kicks and turns

and curls up in your belly, makes you

wanna freaky-deaky, right? If you get

this unit as it is -- it won't sound

like this without the modification --

and we do that for a small price.

The Customer listens another moment, then;

CUSTOMER

Thank you for your time.

BUCK

No problem.

The Customer exits and Jerry approaches Buck.

JERRY

BUCK

Wha?

JERRY

Have I told you? Huh? Have I?

BUCK

What? I don't --

JERRY

Alright: A.) You play that country

western-crap and no one's gonna buy

a stereo. You throw on some KC and

the Sunshine Band, a guy looks a particular

way -- and you've seen the profile sheet --

you throw on some Led Zeppelin. No.

Instead, you play this twingy-twangy,

yappy-dappy music. What kinda brother

are you anyway, listening to that shit?

BUCK

Hey, Jerry, look --

JERRY

No, you look. I gave you a job here

because I thought your film work

might bring some nice pussy in the

place -- and it has -- but I can't

have anymore fuck ups -- you dig?

you got sound, lab fees, developing, synching,

editing -- next thing you know you're

spending thirty/forty thousand a picture.

DIRK

That's a lot of money.

JACK

Hell yes it's a lot of money, but lemme

tell you something else: You make a good

film and there's practically no end to the

amount of money you can make, Eddie.

AMBER

Have you seen Jack's house?

CAMERA HOLDS ON AMBER. She watches Dirk.

DIRK (OC)

No.

JACK (OC)

He'll see it.

ROLLERGIRL (OC)

He'll see it.

JACK (OC)

Eddie: You got ten, fifteen people around

and that's just to make sure the lighting is

right . . . shit, this is not an operation for

the weak, and lemme tell you something else:

When all is said and done, you gotta have the

juice, you understand? I mean . . . you can work

on your arms, your legs, workout morning, day,

noon, night, the whole deal, but when it comes

right down to it . . . what we need is Mr. Torpedo

Area, y'understand? Mr. Fun Zone? Okay, let's

say you got that: right? And You Do Got, Yeah?

He looks to Rollergirl. She smiles. CAMERA OFF AMBER NOW.

JACK

I can go out -- tonight -- the reputation

I got: I can find myself 15/20 guys,

cocks the size of Willie Mays Baseball Bat:

Do I want that? No. Do I need that? No.

I need actors.

AMBER

Uhhh-ohhh . . . here we go --

JACK

-- Alright, yeah, I need the big dick,

and the big tits -- that GETS them in

the theater. What keeps them in their

seats even after they've come? Huh?

The beauty and the acting.

If you're able to give it up and show the world:

No, not just your cock. Fuck that.

What I'm talking about is showing your

insides, from your heart . . . you understand?

Hey, Sure: GET THEM IN THE THEATER.

That's one thing. I don't want 'em showing up,

sitting down, jacking off and splitting on

the story. I don't want to make that film.

I wanna make the thing that keeps 'em around

even after they've come . . . what happens when you

come? You're done, you wanna split.

My idea, my goal: Suck 'em in with the

story . . . they'll squirt their load and sit in it . . .

Just To See How The Story Ends.

Sometimes we make these films, we wanna

make people laugh a little, then get into

it and fuck heavy: That's good and that's fine.

But I got a dream of making a film that's

true . . . true and right and dramatic.

DIRK

. . . Right . . . right . . . I understand.

AMBER

Don't listen too hard to all this,

honey . . . it's just nice in theory.

JACK

It's a dream to be able to find

a cock and an actor.

ROLLERGIRL

Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream.

DIRK

If you don't have dreams you have nightmares.

HOLD. Amber, Jack and Rollergirl look at Dirk.

ROLLERGIRL

Here We Go! Are We Gonna Fuck?

JACK

Yes you are.

ROLLERGIRL

Oh, wait, wait, wait, then.

She rolls over to the Hi-Fi system and picks a record. She sets the needle
on the turntable and rolls over to the couch -- in one swift motion ripping
her clothes off.

ROLLERGIRL

You ready?

DIRK

Are you?

ROLLERGIRL

Ohhh-yeah.

They kiss. They lean back on the couch. Dirk stops a moment.

DIRK

Are you gonna take your skates off?

ROLLERGIRL

I don't take my skates off.

DIRK

Okay.

ROLLERGIRL

Don't fucking come in me.

The idea is this: Amber is a director

of porno films and she's down on her luck.

She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's

desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her

out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?

COLONEL

Yes. Good dilemma.

JACK

Yes. So she calls up all the agencies

in town and says: ""Send over your best

actors, I'm casting a porno picture.""

Well, the story goes and develops with

Amber auditioning various men and

women . . . the whole thing wraps up with

the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if

he's still in town to play the part --

he comes in -- the landlord says:

You better pay rent or you're through.

Well, Amber does one helluva suck job,

ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing

and fade out - the end.

There's a kid, a young man, I met him

last night: His name is Eddie Adams.

He's here, he's at the party. He's something

special and I want to cast him.

This would be his first.

KURT LONGJOHN

OK . . . fine . . . I was just saying . . .

KURT LONGJOHN

-- cause I'm just trying to give each

DIRK

A long time.

AMBER

That's terrible.

DIRK

But I'm back now and I'm ready to pursue

my acting career.

CAMERA (STEADICAM) begins on Reed who's doing a MAGIC TRICK in the living
room for Scotty J. and Becky. Jessie is oil painting.

Dirk and Amber enter FRAME and CAMERA follows them through the house. Dirk
is giving her a tour, explaining what type of leather couches he has, what
sort of history he knows about the wood used to build the house, showing
her a painting on the wall of himself that was done by Jessie St. Vincent,
etc. They move into --

THE KITCHEN

Maurice and Rollergirl are deep in conversation. He's trying to convince
her that she should take a picture with him without her clothes on so he
can send it to his brothers in Puerto Rico.

CAMERA stays foreground with their conversation while Dirk shows Amber the
back deck area of the house --

(Director's Note: Sound covers the four talking simultaneously.)

Rollergirl stops arguing with Maurice;

ROLLERGIRL

Fuck it, fine, let's go.

She rips off her bikini top, sets the POLAROID on the counter, hits the
timer, rolls back and poses with Maurice --

CU - DEVELOPED POLAROID

the image is of their waists - the Polaroid framing was too low.

Dirk and Amber come f.g. and CAMERA leads them --

DIRK

And around this corner is the big surprise.

The main thing I wanna show you --

They move down a hallway and into --

THE GARAGE

It's dark for a moment, Dirk hits the garage door and it starts to open . .

Amber and your relationship and I dunno --

DIRK

No, no, Jessie. You shouldn't feel

like an outsider.

JESSIE

I know my tits aren't as big and I know

my pussy isn't as tight as all the other

girls in this industry but I still feel

like I've got something that works --

I can paint, too.

DIRK

Yes. Yes. Yes.

JESSIE

I dunno. I was just never really secure.

When I was a kid, I was never really secure

with myself that much -- I guess that's why

I try and act like I'm all care-free and everything.

DIRK

I know what you mean, sometimes I'm like,

""What am I doing?"" ""What the hell is wrong

with me?"" Y'know?

JESSIE

I know, I know.

DIRK

But then . . . I think . . .

JESSIE

-- it's just fun. It's great.

DIRK

It is. It's the best. I mean, look:

I couldn't be happier than where

I am today, right now, at this moment.

JESSIE

You are so fucking awesome, Dirk.

DIRK

Who says you don't have a tight pussy?

JESSIE

I don't know. No one, I guess.

pissed, Amber. So then I was all,

like, ""What are you gonna do?"" Y'know?

And he was all, like acting tough,

y'know, with his friends around and stuff.

CUT TO:

91 INT. JACK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Jack, Floyd Gondolli and the Colonel sitting.

FLOYD

. . . so let's talk about the future.

So let's talk about what video means

to this industry -- and let's talk

about how all of us -- not one of us --

but all of us will profit. I've been doing

theater work in San Francisco and San Diego

for as long as you've been doing stag

and hardcore, Jack.

JACK

I know you're history, Floyd.

COLONEL

No one's doubting your history

or your credentials, Floyd.

FLOYD

Then why the resistance? I mean:

This industry is going to be turned

upside down soon enough --

JACK

Then why help it?

FLOYD

Why not be prepared? The money comes

from the Colonel, the talent comes from

you, Jack. I've got a connection to the

equipment and the mail order distribution,

not to mention those kids I got out there

who are hot-fuck-action to the max.

This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.

JACK

I have a stable of actors and actresses.

They're professionals. They're not

a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're

proven box office and they get people

in theaters (where films should be seen)

and they know how to fuck well --

FLOYD

That's right, Jack and by that

same token, you're the one with the

power here. The video revolution

is upon us -- and our role is critical.

We have an obligation to use our resources

and talent to help make it fly --

JACK

You come in here, at my party, tell me about

this and that -- tell me about the future,

tell me about -- video and amateurs and

all that -- well lemme tell you something now:

I will not shoot films on video and no

I will not loan out my actors who are

under contract to me. Period.

FLOYD

Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.

I like cinema. In particular, I like to

see fucking on film. I don't want to win

an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the

wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter

in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.

That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert,

but this is something I enjoy. One other

small thing I want to do in this life is make

a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not

trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay

one step ahead of the game --

JACK

We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.

COLONEL

Jack, I think this is about cost and future --

JACK

The future is as bright as we make it --

it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars

that can be saved shooting on video tape --

if it looks like shit and sounds like shit,

it probably is shit --

FLOYD

I think you're one gin past this conversation --

JACK

No . . . no. I'm crystal clear here.

COLONEL

Jack, please understand that this is

not an argument . . . this is a fact of --

JACK

. . . What . . . ?

COLONEL

This is not an argument, but a --

JACK

What are you saying?

COLONEL

What do you mean, Jack, c'mon --

JACK

Are you telling me that you're

working with this shit?

COLONEL

I think that there is a serious case

to be made for the price and the gamble

on the whole idea of a home video market --

Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's

gonna be able to walk into their local

supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --

JACK

True film fans won't watch that shit.

It doesn't look good and more importantly

it doesn't make sex look sexy.

COLONEL

It doesn't have to look good, Jack.

Film is just too damn expensive.

The theaters are already planning

converting to video projectors.

JACK

I haven't heard that.

FLOYD

It's true.

JACK

We've got ten minutes until the New

Year and I don't want it to start like this

so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't

continue this conversation some other time.

Jack leaves. Floyd looks to the Colonel. HOLD.

CUT TO:

92 INT. AMBER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dirk and Amber enter. She sits him on the bed.

AMBER

I wanted you . . . to just . . . to come

tell you how much I love you.

It's gonna be a new year and we're

gonna start things and do things

and I want you to know how much I

really care for you, honey. I care

for you so much . . . you're my little baby . . .

DIRK

Thank you, Amber.

AMBER

You're the best thing in the world

that's happened to me since my son

AMBER

Make sure you snort it back quick and hard . . .

DIRK

AMBER

Really fast, like this . . .

She demonstrates. Dirk hesitates a moment, then leans down and does a line
of coke.

DIRK

It burns.

AMBER

It's good, though, right?

DIRK

It's in my throat . . . uch . . .

AMBER

It's the drip . . . the drip's the best part.

DIRK

Tastes like aspirin.

AMBER

Do one more in the other nostril.

DIRK

It could be like two/three thousand

dollars worth of damage, Dirk.

DIRK

So?

TODD

I dunno.

DIRK

We gotta get those fuckin' demo tapes, too.

I mean it . . . let's go kick that guy's ass

155 INT. HEARING ROOM - COURT BUILDING - DAY

Amber is sitting in a room with a long desk, a few chairs and fluorescent
lights. A middle aged female JUDGE enters and greets her;

JUDGE

Hello. You must be Maggie?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

I'm Kathleen O'Malley. The judge.

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

You have a lawyer with you?

AMBER

No. I don't. I do not.

They sit in silence. The Judge looks over a couple of files. Moments later,
Amber's ex-husband, THOMAS (late 30s) steps in with his LAWYER. They all
take seats.

LAWYER

Hello, Judge.

Introductions happen, etc. BEAT. The Judge looks over some files;

JUDGE

You've been divorced for six years.

AMBER

Yes. Since 1977.

JUDGE

(to lawyer)

And the agreement on the money settlement

was taken care of?

LAWYER

Yes.

JUDGE

So. What we're talking about then

is coming to an agreement on custody of Andrew?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

What was decided during the divorce?

LAWYER

Initially, Andrew went with his father,

and visitation was given to his mother on --

(looks at a paper)

from Saturday Noon to Sunday at seven.

With his mother entitled to bring Andrew

to her home or any reasonable place.

JUDGE

(to Amber)

Was that the understanding?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?

THOMAS

Well, it was for a time --

AMBER

I only saw him twice.

THOMAS

It said, ""reasonable place,"" and I didn't

think a house of drugs and prostitution

and pornography was that.

JUDGE

I'm sorry, what is it that you --

THOMAS

My ex-wife is involved in the pornography

business -- I didn't think that environment

was a safe place for my son.

AMBER

This is not right. My son was never

exposed to pornographic material or

drugs or any of these things, my husband

just assumed --

THOMAS

I saw it with my own eye.

PAUSE. Amber has no response. The Judge looks down at the file.

JUDGE

Did you register this as a complaint?

LAWYER

My client didn't officially register,

but I think the circumstance called

for something immediate -- for the

safety of the child.

JUDGE

How old is the boy now?

THOMAS

He's twelve.

AMBER

He'll be thirteen next month.

JUDGE

Where do you live now?

THOMAS

We live in Long Beach. I have a job

there and my new wife is home with him.

(pause)

You see, the problem is, Judge, is that

my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick

person and she needs help. She deals in

drugs and sex for a living --

AMBER

I don't do drugs.

LAWYER

Your honor, she has been in and out

of trouble with the law on quite a few

occasions regarding this sort of thing.

AMBER

No. No. Not anymore

CAMERA HOLDS ON AMBER. She watches the Judge. OC there's the sound of
papers shuffling.

JUDGE (OC)

Have you ever been arrested?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE (OC)

arrested . . . what was the charge . . . ?

JACK

We are On The Lookout. That's what

We're just gonna drive on down Ventura,

back here in the limo -- and we'll capture

I know he won't. I'm positive. Believe me.

REED

It's a pretty good idea.

DIRK

I think we should go for it.

172 EXT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Corvette pulls up in front of a tacky one-story house in the hills of
Studio City. The Corvette stops and CAMERA DOLLIES IN QUICK. Dirk, Reed,
Todd sit in the parked car. In sotto;

DIRK

Okay.

TODD

You guys ready for this?

REED

I am.

TODD

Dirk?

DIRK

Me? Yeah . . . yeah, I'm ready. I was born ready.

TODD

Alright.

Todd takes out a .45 AUTOMATIC PISTOL and loads a cartridge.

DIRK

What the fuck is that?

TODD

It's a big gun.

DIRK

I know, but why?

TODD

Just in case, just in case. Let's go.

They pile out of the damaged Corvette and walk up. CAMERA (STEADICAM)
follows them.

REED

I'm nervous.

TODD

It'll be okay.

REED

Let's get in and out, in and out.

TODD

Not too quick -- that looks suspicious.

Lemme do the talking --

They arrive and ring the doorbell.

CUT TO:

173 INT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - THAT MOMENT

A really big fat black BODYGUARD comes to the door and opens up:

BODYGUARD

Hello. Come on in.

The bodyguard leads them down a hall and into a tacky and spacious, sunken
LIVING ROOM.

They're greeted by a man in a silk robe, slightly open to show some bikini
briefs and a thin sheen of sweat covering his body: RAHAD JACKSON (late
40s).

Off in a corner of the room, a YOUNG ASIAN KID is casually throwing some
FIRECRACKERS around.

Rahad is DANCING around by himself to NIGHT RANGER, ""SISTER CHRISTIAN."" He
spots the men;

RAHAD

Hello, friends. Which one is Todd?

TODD

That's me. We met before at the club --

RAHAD

Oh, yeah. Come on in here.

TODD

These are my friends Dirk and Reed.

RAHAD

Great to meet you. You guys want something

to drink -- or a pill -- or some coke --

or some dope?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you, thanks, no.

RAHAD

So what do we have, we have, something, yeah?

TODD

Here it is . . . half a key . . . it's really good,

if you wanna test it out --

RAHAD

Oh, wait a minute, I love this part:

(sings along)

""SISTER CHRISTIAN, THERE'S SO MUCH

IN LIFE, DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP BEFORE

YOUR TIME IS DUE . . . IT'S TRUE!""

(to Dirk)

This song is so amazing.

Anyway: What's the price?

TODD

We were thinking five thousand.

RAHAD

That's good. No problem, cool, cool.

The Bodyguard brings over a PAPER BAG FULL OF CASH and hands the bag to
Todd in exchange for the PAPER BAG FULL OF BAKING SODA.

Reed watches the Bodyguard take the bag and notices something. REED'S POV:
a SHOULDER HOLSTER holds a .45 Automatic Pistol.

Rahad does an air guitar solo to the Night Ranger song . . . he walks
across the room, picks up a COKE PIPE and looks to the guys;

RAHAD

You wanna play baseball?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you.

Rahad strokes the pipe while dancing. Dirk looks across to an open bedroom
door.

DIRK'S POV: Through the crack in the door, we can see a bloody, battered
YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in a silk robe . . .she's followed by another YOUNG WHITE
GIRL in nothing.

RAHAD (OC)

Check this out --

He takes out a nickel plated REVOLVER and loads a single bullet, spins the
chamber and puts it to his head and sings;

RAHAD

SISTER CHRISTIAN -- OH THE TIME HAS

COME . . . AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE

THE ONLY ONE TO SAY . . . OK . . .

He pulls the trigger . . . Click . . . he smiles and casually speaks;

RAHAD

I put a mix tape together of all

my favorite songs . . . This is song number

three . . . I love putting mix tapes together,

you know . . . if you buy an album or tape or

something, those guys put the songs in their

order and they try and say how you should listen

to the songs, but I don't like that.

I don't like to be told what to listen

to, when to listen to or anything . . .

The Night Ranger song FADES OUT . . . BEAT . . . Rahad smiles at the Asian
Kid who's casually throwing some firecrackers around.

RAHAD

(to Dirk/Reed/Todd)

He's Chinese . . . he loves to set

off firecrackers . . .

REO SPEEDWAGON, ""CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING,"" begins to play.

RAHAD

I CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING ANY LONGER

AND YET I'm STILL AFRAID TO LET IT FLOW.

WHAT STARTED OUT AS FRIENDSHIP HAS GROWN

STRONGER -- I ONLY WISH I HAD THE STRENGTH

TO LET IT SHOW --

DIRK

Well . . . I think maybe . . . we better get going --

RAHAD

No, stay. Hang out. We'll party.

DIRK

No, we really gotta split.

We have to be somewhere and we --

Dirk and Rahad continue to haggle about leaving/not leaving. CAMERA BEGINS
A SLOW DOLLY INTO A CU ON TODD.

TODD

We're Not Leaving Yet.

Dirk and Reed look at Todd. He stands up.

TODD

We're here now and we want something else.

Hey -- Hey. We Want Something Else From You.

RAHAD

What?

DIRK

Todd -- what the hell are you doing?

TODD

In the master bedroom, under the bed,

in a floor safe . . . You understand?

The Bodyguard turns his head. Dirk and Reed are confused;

DIRK

Todd . . . what the fuck, man, c'mon --

TODD

Shut up, Dirk. I told you I got a plan.

I got a good plan.

RAHAD

Are you kiddin' me kittie?

TODD

No I'm not. I'm not kidding. We want

what's in the safe. We want what's in

the safe in the floor under the bed in

the master bedroom.

DIRK

Todd -- don't be crazy.

(to Rahad)

Sir -- we don't know anything about this.

This is not the thing that we wanted.

TODD

SHUT THE FUCK UP, DIRK.

The BODYGUARD reaches into his coat . . .

. . . Todd pulls his REVOLVER quickly and AIMS at the Bodyguard.

TODD

Don't reach for your gun.

. . . Rahad reacts by AIMING HIS GUN AT TODD . . .

RAHAD

You don't wanna do this, friendly.

TODD

You've only got one bullet.

Rahad PULLS THE TRIGGER . . . a bullet FIRES from the gun and strikes Todd
in the SHOULDER . . . the gun in his hand falls to the floor and he
stumbles back . . .

. . . The Bodyguard takes this moment to GRAB HIS OWN GUN from the holster
and FIRE off shots at Dirk and Reed . . .

. . . Bullets graze past them and they DUCK FOR COVER . . .

. . . The GIRLS in the bedroom SCREAM and SHOUT at the gunfire . . .

. . . A STRAY BULLET HITS the ASIAN KID in the heart, but he doesn't fall .
. .

. . . TODD reaches hold of his gun, crouches for cover and FIRES a bullet
STRAIGHT INTO the Bodyguard . . . who falls back DEAD . . . Todd looks
right and sees:

RAHAD scuttles into the bedroom with the women . . . Todd looks over his
shoulder to Dirk and Reed;

DIRK

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, TODD?

TODD

He went in the bedroom.

DIRK

ARE YOU CRAZY? WHEN DID YOU GO CRAZY?

TODD

He's got cash and coke in the safe

under the bed -- if we leave here

without it we're fools.

REED

Let's just split, let's just split

right now, Todd. Don't be stupid.

This wasn't part of the deal.

TODD

I'm goin' in that bedroom and get what's

in that safe. Are you coming?

DIRK

Fuck no. Todd. Don't. Don't do it.

Todd gets up and heads for the bedroom with his revolver at the ready . . .
he inches closer to the door and twists the door knob, then KICKS THE DOOR
OPEN;

. . . Rahad is standing right there, holding a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. He pulls
the trigger . . . Todd blinks . . .

. . . Rahad's SHOTGUN BLAST blows Todd BACK and UP in the air about fifteen
feet . . . he FALLS to the ground with a HOLE in his STOMACH about the size
of a basketball . . . Rahad calls out to Dirk and Reed;

RAHAD

C'mon out, little puppies. You want to

come and see, come and see, to get what

is coming down. Coming down.

Rahad peers out from his bedroom, sees a sliver of Dirk behind the wall.
Rahad FIRES HIS SHOTGUN . . . which cuts right past Dirk's head and SHREDS
the wall near him . . .

Reed and Dirk make a DASH for the front door . . .

Dirk gets around to the driver's side of the Corvette, shielded and
crouched -- he opens the door and starts to get in --

ANOTHER SHOT BLOWS THE PASSENGER'S SIDE WINDOW OUT.

GLASS SPRAYS IN HIS EYES AND HIS HAND SLIPS DOWN, RELEASING THE EMERGENCY
BRAKE OF THE CAR -- WHICH BEGINS TO ROLL DOWN THE STREET--

Dirk stumbles back from the car. He looks to the house:

Rahad is about to FIRE the shotgun again . . .

. . . he looks down the street: the Corvette is ROLLING away and picking up
speed as it goes down the hill --

Dirk gets on his feet and makes a run for the car, Rahad FIRES . . .

take a hit from his crack pipe. A DISCO song is playing LOUDLY and Rahad is
dancing. HOLD, THEN:

A young PAPERBOY rides past and throws the paper, hitting Dirk in the head.
He hesitates, then walks up the steps;

knocks. Moments later . . . the door opens; A young woman in a bathrobe

High, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

291,Lonely Street,"Sometimes when I'm walking down this lonely street
Well, it sure don't seem like twenty years
Since I went walking down this lonely street
And the smell of perfumed ladies filled the air

This street ain't got no name, dead end is in the river
And I lived where I hated life day by day
There wasn't nothing I could do to shake a cold night shiver
'Cause to move up Lonely Street you had to have some say

Gambling is bad luck down on Lonely Street
And it sure ain't no place to be when a man gets sore
You know I killed a man and I paid all I can
With twenty years on a chain gang
For the flesh and the blood on that jailhouse floor

Sometimes when I'm walking down this lonely street
I get caught up in a dream that won't let me go
And as the bright lights flash up and down this lonely street
My mind rolls back the years long time ago

I see my baby stumblin' around with tears in her eyes
And as I reach out for her she falls on the floor
She mumbles through bloody lips about a bad man, robber, raper
And in my gut I know I got one to score

The word was comin' down, down on Lonely Street
That the bad man was a dead man if he crossed my trail
Every night I'd walk up and down this Lonely Street
I get stinkin' drunk, and always in jail
One night they threw me in with a man they called the mangler
He was caught on the street makin' some old whore
I remember he was quite proud of that
So half-crazed I shot him
And I cried in the blood on that jailhouse floor",Kansas,1961,"[67, 57, 64, 70, 72, 88]",6

[Intro: Drake, Romeo Santos]
Yeah, yeah
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tú desvaneces
Y  me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepción
Sé que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdón por hacerte daño

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verso 2: Drake, Drake & Romeo Santos, Romeo Santos]
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Interludio: Romeo Santos & Drake]
Escucha las palabras
Yeah, drizzy Drake

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
Yo fui el llanto, él es tu sonrisa (turn the lights on)
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán muy de prisa

[Verso 3: Drake]
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos

Let the wind blow high
Let the wind blow low
Through the streets
In my kilt, I'll go
All the lassies say hello
Donald, where's your troosers

A lassie took me to a ball
And it was slippery in the hall
And I was feared that I would fall
For I had nae on my troosers

Now I went down to London Town
And I had some fun in the underground
The ladies turned their heads around
Saying, Donald, where are your trousers

To wear the kilt is my delight
It is not wrong I know it's right
The Highlanders would get a fright
If they saw me in the trousers

You canna take the breaks
If a Highland man
And I don't wear the troosers

Have more international appeal

And I'm a-moving and
A-grooving to save my soul
Grab your kilt and go, go, go

Let the wind blow low

In my kilt, I'll go

Hey Donald, where's your troosers
Yeah, hey, Donald

Hey, just a minute
What are you doing there
(Man, I'm rocking it, man)
(Man, I'm really moving it, man)

Well just you stop rocking it
And moving it, man

Alright this is classic shit, yeah

[Verse 1: Logic]
I coulda never imagine that this shit here could happen
Went from the basement to thirty million just off of rappin'
Young Sinatra, that boy that brought you so many classics
Ain't never comin' with nothin' less than the illest tactics
Thought the series was over, but we just gettin' started
I won't ever leave this rap shit, no I can't depart it
From the trap to the boom bap
To Young Sinatra to Tarantino
We know he do that
Bitch, I got the flame, who dat?
I'm the new Kanye when they was like ""Who Kanye?""
I got that fire in my soul to make these classics, ayy
I decided to write this letter on a private jet
'Cause in many ways it still feel like I ain't made it yet
For every goal I attain, I set like ten more
But I had to take a break to write you, that's for sure
Take a moment and celebrate how we all alive
Had to write this letter here over a Nujabes vibe
Fuck that rapper shit, fuck a punchline
This for every single fan that know every single line
So I'm saying thank you for loving me
For setting me free and letting me be me

Thank you, thank you
For letting me speak my mind
And putting it all on the line
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
And never staying the same
And having the courage to change
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
For never staying the same
And having the courage to change
Thank you, thank you
For letting me speak my mind
And putting it all on the line
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
For never staying the same
And having the courage to change

[Verse 1]
Boldy blocks, Bend Street, king of the skelly
In the jelly, whipping s'ghetti getting so much fetti
Call me Soda Popinski or 'chine Gun Kelly
From Kelly to telly in my soda club pelle
On the block, 10 deep, three five seven
One dessi, two 'chetes, and my throwaway peggy
If the police try to flick me, I'm fleeing
When they catch me they goin' hit me with a netty
So you know it ain't petty
You know it ain't reggie
You knew you wasn't ready
If you hit me, better catch me, you know I ain't friendly (at all)
Like Casper, you know I ain't friendly
And friendly got a stash, now I'm ghost with my friend Lee
In the Jag blowing smoke with a 10 piece
Graduated from semipro to the big leagues
Had to let them know what the six meant
That's where I'm at, here I go, come and get me

[Hook]
In no time
It's been a longtime coming for a longtime
It's been a longtime running from a longtime
Kept the phone lines jumping like a telethon
In the blowspot putting out that topside
Spent my whole life thugging in the sunshine
With my .45 ducking from the one time
It's been a longtime running from a longtime
It's been a longtime coming, had a long run

[Verse 2]
Fell asleep with my finger on the trigger
That's a real street dream, why you sleeping on a nigga?
Never me slipping, reaching for the blick again
Peeled, sweet dreams, you sleeping with the fishes
In the creeks, send a finger to your Mrs
And the meal, can't let them get the drop on me
Call me what you want, just don't call the cops on me
Or call me collect at the spot homie
(Hello? Who is this? Where the fuck is Boldy?
Dawg working with the feds, trynna put them on me)
Got popped with a brick and some mark money
Got off with intent, did a 1 to 20
For snitching on my cuddy, nigga had it coming to him
I fell off, but bounced back like Silly Putty (Big Dummy!)
I risked fed time for this money
It's concreatures
Hellblock, hully gully

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When my back is against the wall
What happens if it should fall?
I live for today, but pray for a better tomorrow
Crack is against the law
What happens if you get caught?
For selling that yay? And they send you behind the wall?
Why would you risk it all?
Moochie, I've been through it all
Might as well give it all to me, I can move it all
Magical with the wand, don't panic when it dissolve
That's just its purest form, no additives but the Arm and Hammer
When whip it hard, the hammer is a revolver
Jam it like that's my song, they play it in rental cars
Traffic and bricks of raw, bird play, chicken talk
I know Sergei and I ain't talking Fedorov
Niggas with jealous hearts turn state, tip you off
Don't even know what a chirp weigh, or what it costs
After a get it off, first base, second, walk
Stole third base, heading home, finna score a homerun

Giddy-up, here, boy

[Verse 1]
When the Lord made me, he made a simple man
Not much money and not much land
He didn't make me no banker or legal charmer
When the Lord made me he made a Blackland farmer

[Verse 2]
Well my hands ain't smooth, my face is rough
But my heart is warm and my ways ain't tough
I guess I'm the luckiest man ever born
'Cause the Lord gave me health and a Blackland farm

[Verse 3]
Breakin' up the new ground early in the day
Gonna plant cotton, I'm gonna plant hay
I love the smell of sweet breeze blowin' through the corn
Lord you sure done me right by my Blackland farm

[Vers3 4]
I feel like I'm a-gettin' closer to you, God
A plow in the ground and a-breakin' up the sod
Well, my mind is at ease and I could do no harm

318,The Boll Weevil Song,"Let me tell ya a story about a boll weevil
Now, some of you may not know, but a boll weevil is an insect
And he's found mostly where cotton grows
Now, where he comes from, hmm, nobody really knows
But this is the way the story goes

The farmer said to the boll weevil ""I see you're on the square""
Boll weevil said to the farmer ""Say yep! My whole darn family's here""
(We gotta have a home, gotta have a home)

The farmer said to the boll weevil ""Say, why do you pick my farm?""
The weevil just laughed at the farmer 'n' said
""We ain't gonna do ya much harm""
(""We're looking for a home"")

And the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug
He said ""Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you
But, ya see if I was a lightning bug, I'd search the whole night through""
(""Searchin' for a home, I'd have me plenty of home"")

And the boll weevil called the farmer, 'n' he said
""Ya better sell your old machines
'Cause when I'm through with your cotton, heh
You can't even buy gasoline.""
(I'm gonna stake me a home, gotta have a home)

And the boll weevil said to the farmer, said
""Farmer, I'd like to wish you well.""
Farmer said to the boll weevil, ""Yeah, an' I wish that you were in shit""

321,Runaround,"It was one of Gregory Powell's favorite platitudes that nothing was to be gained from excitement, so when Mike Donovan came leaping down the stairs toward him, red hair matted with perspiration, Powell frowned.

""What's wrong?"" he said. ""Break a fingernail?""

""Yaaaah,"" snarled Donovan, feverishly. ""What have you been doing in the sublevels all day?"" He took a deep breath and blurted out, ""Speedy never returned.""

Powell's eyes widened momentarily and he stopped on the stairs; then he recovered and resumed his upward steps. He didn't speak until he reached the head of the flight, and then:
""You sent him after the selenium?""

""Yes.""

""And how long has he been out?""

""Five hours now.""

Silence! This was a devil of a situation. Here they were, on Mercury exactly twelve hours-and already up to the eyebrows in the worst sort of trouble. Mercury had long been the jinx world of the System, but this was drawing it rather strong-even for a jinx.

Powell said, ""Start at the beginning, and let's get this straight.""

They were in the radio room now-with its already subtly antiquated equipment, untouched for the ten years previous to their arrival. Even ten years, technologically speaking, meant so much. Compare Speedy with the type of robot they must have had back in 2005. But then, advances in robotics these days were tremendous.

Powell touched a still gleaming metal surface gingerly. The air of disuse that touched everything about the room-and the entire Station was infinitely depressing.

Donovan must have felt it.

He began: ""I tried to locate him by radio, but it was no go. Radio isn't any good on the Mercury Sunside not past two miles, anyway. That's one of the reasons the First Expedition failed. And we can't put up the ultrawave equipment for weeks yet-'

""Skip all that. What did you get?""

""I located the unorganized body signal in the short wave. It was no good for anything except his position. I kept track of him that way for two hours and plotted the results on the map.""

There was a yellowed square of parchment in his hip pocket-a relic of the unsuccessful First Expedition-and he slapped it down on the desk with vicious force, spreading it flat with the palm of his hand. Powell, hands clasped across his chest, watched it at long range.

Donovan's pencil pointed nervously. ""The red cross is the selenium pool, You marked it yourself.""

""Which one is it?"" interrupted Powell. ""There were three that MacDougal located for us before he left.""

""I sent Speedy to the nearest, naturally. Seventeen miles away. But what difference does that make?"" There was tension in his voice. ""There are the penciled dots that mark Speedv's position.""

And for the first time Powell's artificial aplomb was shaken and his bands shot forward for the map.

""Are you serious? This is impossible.'

""There it is,"" growled Donovan.

The little dots that marked the position formed a rough circle about the red cross of the selenium pool, And Powell's fingers went to his brown mustache., the unfailing signal of anxiety.

Donovan added: ""In the two hours I checked on him, he circled that damned pool four times. It seems likely to me that he'll keep that up forever. Do you realize the position we're in?""

Powell looked up shortly, and said nothing. Oh, yes, he realized the position they were in. It worked itself out as simply as a syllogism. The photo-cell banks that alone stood between the full power of Mercury's monstrous sun and themselves were shot to hell. The only thing that could save them was selenium. The only thing that could get the selenium was Speedy. If Speedy didn't come back, no selenium. No selenium, no photo-cell banks. No photo-banks - well, death by slow broiling is one of the more unpleasant ways of being done in.

Donovan rubbed his red mop of hair savagely and expressed himself with bitterness. ""We'll be the laughingstock of the System, Greg. How can everything have gone so wrong so soon? The great team of Powell and Donovan is sent out to Mercury to report on the advisability of reopening the Sunside Mining Station with modern techniques and robots and we ruin everything the first day. A purely routine job, too. We'll never live it down.""

""We won't have to, perhaps,"" replied Powell, quietly. ""If we don't do something quickly, living anything down-or even just plain living-will be out of the question.""

""Don't be stupid! If you feel funny about it, Greg, I don't. It was criminal, sending us out here with only one robot. And it was your bright idea that we could handle the photo-cell banks ourselves.""

""Now you're being unfair. It was a mutual decision and you know it. All we needed was a kilogram of selenium, a Stillhead Dielectrode Plate and about three hours' time-and there are pools of pure selenium all over Sunside. MacDougal's spectroreflector spotted three for us in five minutes, didn't it? What the devil! We couldn't have waited for next conjunction.""

""Well, what are we going to do? Powell, you've got an idea. I know you have, or you wouldn't be so calm. You're no more a hero than I am. Go on, spill it.""

""We can't go after Speedy ourselves, Mike - not on the Sunside. Even the new insosuits aren't good for more than twenty minutes in direct sunlight. But you know the old saying, 'Set a robot to catch a robot.' Look, Mike, maybe things aren't so bad. We've got six robots down in the sublevels, that we may be able to use, if they work. If they work.""

There was a glint of sudden hope in Donovan's eyes. ""You mean six robots from the First Expedition. Are you sure? They may be subrobotic machines. Ten years is a long time as far as robot-types are concerned, you know.""

""No, they're robots. I've spent all day with them and I know. They've got positronic brains: primitive, of course."" He placed the map in his pocket.

""Let's go down.""

The robots were on the lowest sublevel - all six of them surrounded by musty packing cases of uncertain content. They were large, extremely so, and even though they were in a sitting position on the floor, legs straddled out before them, their heads were: a good seven feet in the air.

Donovan whistled. ""Look at the size of them, will you? The chests must be ten feet around.""

""That's because they're supplied with the old McGuffy gears. I've been over the insides - crummiest set you've ever seen.""

""Have you powered them yet?""

""No. There wasn't any reason to. I don't think there's anything wrong with them. Even the diaphragm is in reasonable order. They might talk.""

He had unscrewed the chest plate of the nearest as he spoke, inserted the two-inch sphere that contained the tiny spark of atomic energy that was a robot's life. There was difficulty in fitting it, but he managed, and then screwed the plate back on again in laborious fashion. The radio controls of more modern models had not been heard of ten years earlier. And then to the other five.

Donovan said uneasily, ""They haven't moved.""

""No orders to do so,"" replied Powell, succinctly. He went back to the first in the line and struck him on the chest. ""You! Do you hear me?""
The monster's head bent slowly and the eyes fixed themselves on Powell.

Then, in a harsh, squawking voice-like that of a medieval phonograph, he grated, ""Yes, Master!""

Powell grinned humorlessly at Donovan. ""Did you get that? Those were tire days of the first talking robots when it looked as if the use of robots on Earth would be banned. The makers were fighting that and they built good, healthy slave complexes into the damned machines.""

""It didn't help them,"" muttered Donovan.

""No, it didn't, but they sure tried."" He turned once more to the robot. ""Get up!""

The robot towered upward slowly and Donovan's head craned and his puckered lips whistled.

Powell said: ""Can you go out upon the surface? In the light?""

There was consideration while the robot's slow brain worked. Then, ""Yes, Master.""

""Good. Do you know what a mile is?""

Another consideration, and another slow answer. ""Yes, Master.""

""We will take you up to the surface then, and indicate a direction. You will go about seventeen miles, and somewhere in that general region you will meet another robot, smaller than yourself. You understand so far?""

""Yes, Master.""

""You will find this robot and order him to return. If he does not wish to, you are to bring him back by force.""

Donovan clutched at Powell's sleeve. ""Why not send him for the selenium direct?""

""Because I want Speedy back, nitwit. I want to find out what's wrong with him."" And to the robot, ""All right, you, follow me.""
The robot remained motionless and his voice rumbled: ""Pardon, Master, but I cannot. You must mount first."" His clumsy arms had come together with a thwack, blunt fingers interlacing.

Powell stared and then pinched at his mustache. ""Uh . . . oh!""

Donovan's eyes bulged. ""We've got to ride him? Like a horse?""

""I guess that's the idea. I don't know why, though. I can't see - Yes, I do. I told you they were playing up robot-safety in those days. Evidently, they were going to sell the notion of safety by not allowing them to move about, without a mahout on their shoulders all the time. What do we do now?""

""That's what I've been thinking,"" muttered Donovan. ""We can't go out on the surface, with a robot or without. Oh, for the love of Pete"" - and he snapped his fingers twice. He grew excited. ""Give me that map you've got. I haven't studied it for two hours for nothing. This is a Mining Station. What's wrong with using the tunnels?""

The Mining Station was a black circle on the map, and the light dotted lines that were tunnels stretched out about it in spiderweb fashion.
Donovan studied the list of symbols at the bottom of the map. ""Look,"" he said, ""the small black dots are opening to the surface, and here's one maybe three miles away from the selenium pool. There's a number here - you'd think they'd write larger - 13a. If the robots know their way around here.""

Powell shot the question and received the dull ""Yes, Master,"" in reply. ""Get your insosuit,"" he said with satisfaction.
It was the first time either had worn the insosuits - which marked one time more than either had expected to upon their arrival the day before-and they tested their limb movements uncomfortably.

The insosuit was far bulkier and far uglier than the regulation spacesuit; but withal considerably lighter, due to the fact that they were entirely nonmetallic in composition. Composed of heat-resistant plastic and chemically treated cork layers, and equipped with a desiccating unit to keep the air bone-dry, the insosuits could withstand the full glare of Mercury's sun for twenty minutes. Five to ten minutes more, as well, without actually killing the occupant.

And still the robot's bands formed the stirrup, nor did he betray the slightest atom of surprise at the grotesque figure into which Powell had been converted.

Powell's radio-harshened voice boomed out: ""'Are you ready to take us to Exit 13a?""

""Yes, Master.""

Good, thought Powell; they might lack radio control but-at least they were fitted for radio reception. ""Mount one or the other, Mike,"" he said to Donovan.

He placed a foot in the improvised stirrup and swung upward. He found the seat comfortable; there was the humped back of the robot, evidently shaped for the purpose, a shallow groove along each shoulder for the thighs and two elongated ""cars"" whose purpose now seemed obvious.

Powell seized the ears and twisted the head. His mount turned ponderously. ""Lead on, Macduff."" But he did not feel at all lighthearted.
The gigantic robots moved slowly, with mechanical precision, through the doorway that cleared their heads by a scant foot, so that the two men had to duck hurriedly, along a narrow corridor in which their unhurried footsteps boomed monotonously and into the air lock.

The long, airless tunnel that stretched to a pinpoint before them brought home forcefully to Powell the exact magnitude of the task accomplished by the First Expedition, with their crude robots and their start-from-scratch necessities. They might have been a failure, but their failure was a good deal better than the usual run of the System's successes.

The robots plodded onward with a pace that never varied and with footsteps that never lengthened.

Powell said: ""Notice that these tunnels are blazing with lights and that the temperature is Earth-normal. It's probably been like this all the ten years that this place has remained empty.""

""How's that?""

""Cheap energy; cheapest in the System. Sunpower, you know, and on Mercury's Sunside, sunpower is something. That's why the Station was built in the sunlight rather than in the shadow of a mountain. It's really a huge energy converter. The heat is turned into electricity, light, mechanical work and what have you; so that energy is supplied and the Station is cooled in a simultaneous process.""

""Look,"" said Donovan. ""This is all very educational, but would you mind changing the subject? It so happens that this conversion of energy that you talk about is carried on by the photocell banks mainly-and that is a tender subject with me at the moment.""

Powell grunted vaguely, and when Donovan broke the resulting silence, it was to change the subject completely. ""Listen, Greg. What the devil's wrong with Speedy, anyway? I can't understand it.""

It's not easy to shrug shoulders in an insosuit, but Powell tried it. ""I don't know, Mike. You know he's perfectly adapted to a Mercurian environment. Heat doesn't mean anything to him and he's built for the light gravity and the broken ground. He's foolproof - or, at least, he should be.""

Silence fell. This time, silence that lasted.

""Master,"" said the robot, ""we are here.""

""Eh?"" Powell snapped out of a semidrowse. ""Well, get us out of here - out to the surface.""
They found themselves in a tiny substation, empty, airless, ruined. Donovan had inspected a jagged hole in the upper reaches of one of the walls by the light of his pocket flash.

""Meteorite, do you suppose?"" he had asked.

Powell shrugged. ""To hell with that. It doesn't matter. Let's get out.""

A towering cliff of a black, basaltic rock cut off the sunlight, and the deep night shadow of an airless world surrounded them. Before them, the shadow reached out and ended in knife-edge abruptness into an all-but-unbearable blaze of white light, that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground.

""Space!"" gasped Donovan. ""It looks like snow."" And it did.

Powell's eyes swept the jagged glitter of Mercury to the horizon and winced at the gorgeous brilliance.

""This must be an unusual area,"" he said. ""The general albedo of Mercury is low and most of the soil is gray pumice. Something like the Moon, you know. Beautiful, isn't it?""

He was thankful for the light filters in their visiplates. Beautiful or not, a look at the sunlight through straight glass would have blinded them inside of half a minute.

Donovan was looking at the spring thermometer on his wrist. ""Holy smokes, the temperature is eighty centigrade""

Powell checked his own and said: ""Um-m-m. A little high. Atmosphere, you know.""

""On Mercury? Are you nuts?""

""Mercury isn't really airless,"" explained Powell, in absent-minded fashion. He was adjusting the binocular attachments to his visiplate, and the bloated fingers of the insosuit were clumsy at it. ""There is a thin exhalation that clings to its surface-vapors of the more volatile ,elements and compounds that are heavy enough for Mercurian gravity to retain, You know: selenium, iodine, mercury, gallium, potassium, bismuth, volatile oxides. The vapors sweep into the shadows and condense, giving up heat. It's a sort of gigantic still. In fact, if you use your flash, you'll probably find that the side of the cliff is covered with, say, hoar-sulphur, or maybe quicksilver dew.""

""It doesn't matter, though. Our suits can stand a measly eighty indefinitely.""

Powell had adjusted the binocular attachments, so that he seemed as eye-stalked as a snail.

Donovan watched tensely. ""See anything?""

The other did not answer immediately, and when he did, his voice was anxious and thoughtful. ""There's a dark spot on the horizon that might be the selenium pool. It's in the right place. But I don't see Speedy.""

Powell clambered upward in an instinctive striving for better view, till he was standing in unsteady fashion upon his robot's shoulders. Legs straddled wide, eyes straining, he said: ""I think I think. Yes, it's definitely he. He's coming this way.""

Donovan followed the pointing finger. He had no binoculars, but there was a tiny moving dot, black against the blazing brilliance of the crystalline ground.

""I see him,"" he yelled. ""Let's get going!""

Powell had hopped down into a sitting position on the robot again, and his suited hand slapped against the Gargantuan's barrel chest. ""Get going!""
""Giddy-ap,"" yelled Donovan, and thumped his heels, spur fashion.

The robots started off, the regular thudding of their footsteps silent in the aimlessness, for the nonmetallic fabric of the insosuits did not transmit sound. There was only a rhythmic vibration just below the border of actual hearing.

""Faster,"" yelled Donovan. The rhythm did not change.

""No use,"" cried Powell, in reply. ""These junk heaps are only geared to one speed. Do you think they're equipped with selective flexors?""

They had burst through the shadow, and the sunlight came down in a white-hot wash and poured liquidly about them.

Donovan ducked involuntarily. ""Wow! Is it imagination or do I feel heat?""

""You'll feel more presently,"" was the grim reply. ""Keep your eye on Speedy.""

Robot SPD 13 was near enough to be seen in detail now. His graceful, streamlined body threw out blazing highlights as he loped with easy speed across the broken ground. His name was derived from his serial initials, of course, but it was apt, nevertheless, for the SPD models were among the fastest robots turned out by the United States Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation.

""Hey, Speedy,"" howled Donovan, and waved a frantic band.

""Speedy!"" shouted Powell. ""Come here!""

The distance between the men and the errant robot was being cut down momentarily-more by the efforts of Speedy than the slow plodding of the ten-year-old antique mounts of Donovan and Powell.

They were close enough now to notice that Speedy's gait included a peculiar rolling stagger, a noticeable side-to-side lurch-and then, as Powell waved his band again and sent maximum juice into his compact head-set radio sender, in preparation for another shout, Speedy looked up and saw them.
Speedy hopped to a halt and remained standing for a moment with just a tiny, unsteady weave, as though he were swaying in a light wind.

Powell yelled: ""All right, Speedy. Come here, boy.""

Whereupon Speedy's robot voice sounded in Powell's earphones for the first time.

It said: ""Hot dog, let's play games. You catch me and I catch you; no love can cut our knife in two. For I'm Little Buttercup, sweet Little Buttercup. Whoops!"" Turning on his heel, he sped off in the direction from which he had come, with a speed and fury that kicked up gouts of baked dust.

And his last words as he receded into the distance were, ""There grew a little flower 'neath a great oak tree"" followed by a curious metallic clicking that might have been a robotic equivalent of a hiccup.

Donovan said weakly: ""Where did he pick up the Gilbert and Sullivan? Say, Greg, he. . he's drunk or something.""

""If you hadn't told me,"" was the bitter response, ""I'd never realize it. Let's get back to the cliff. I'm roasting.""

It was Powell who broke the desperate silence. ""In the first place , he said, ""Speedy isn't drunk -not in the human sense - because he's a robot, and robots don't get drunk. However, there's something wrong with him which is the robotic equivalent of drunkenness,""

""To me, he's drunk,"" stated Donovan, emphatically, ""and all I know is that he thinks we're playing games. And we're not. It's a matter of life and very gruesome death.""

""All right. Don't hurry me. A robot's only a robot. Once we find out what's wrong with him, we can fix it and go on.""

""Once,"" said Donovan, sourly.

Powell ignored him. ""Speedy is perfectly adapted to normal Mercurian environment. But this region"" - and his arm swept wide - ""is definitely abnormal. There's our clue. Now where do these crystals come from? They might have formed from a slowly cooling liquid; but where would you get liquid so hot that it would cool in Mercury I s sun?""

""Volcanic action,"" suggested Donovan, instantly, and Powell's body tensed.

""Out of the mouths of sucklings,"" he said in a small, strange voice, and remained very still for five minutes.

Then, he said, ""Listen, Mike, what did you say to Speedy when you sent him after the selenium?""

Donovan was taken aback. ""Well damn it - I don't know. I just told him to get it.""

""Yes, I know. But how? Try to remember the exact words.""

""I said . . . uh . . . I said: 'Speedy, we need some selenium. You can get it such-and-such a place. Go get it.' That's all. What more did you want me to say?""

""You didn't put any urgency into the order, did you?""

""What for? It was pure routine.""

Powell sighed. ""Well, it can't be helped now - but we're in a fine fix."" He had dismounted from his robot, and was sitting, back against the cliff. Donovan joined him and they linked arms. In the distance the burning sunlight seemed to wait cat-and-mouse for them, and just next to them, the two giant robots were invisible but for the dull red of their photoelectric eyes that stared down at them, unblinking, unwavering and unconcerned.
Unconcerned! As was all this poisonous Mercury, as large in jinx as it was small in size.

Powell's radio voice was tense in Donovan's car: ""Now, look, let's start with the three fundamental Rules of Robotics - the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot's positronic brain."" In the darkness, his gloved fingers ticked off each point.

""We have: One, a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.""

""Right!""

""Two,"" continued Powell, ""a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.""

""Right!""

""And three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does Dot conflict with the First or Second Laws.""

""Right! Now where are we?""

""Exactly at the explanation. The conflict between the various rules is ironed out by the different positronic potentials in the brain. We'll say that a robot is walking into danger and knows it. The automatic potential that Rule 3 sets up turns him back. But suppose you order him to walk into that danger. In that case, Rule 2 sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the robot follows orders at the risk of existence.""

""Well, I know that. What about it?""

""Let's take Speedy's case. Speedy is one of the latest models, extremely specialized, and as expensive as a battleship. It's not a thing to be lightly destroyed.""

""So?""

""So Rule 3 has been strengthened-that was specifically mentioned, by the way, in the advance notices on the SPD models-so that his allergy to danger is unusually high. At the same time, when you sent him out after the selenium, you gave him his order casually and without special emphasis, so that the
Rule 2 potential set-up was rather weak. Now, hold on; I'm just stating facts.""

""All right, go ahead. I think I get it.""

""You see how it works, don't you? There's some sort of danger centering at the selenium pool. It increases as he approaches, and at a certain distance from it the Rule 3 potential, unusually high to start with, exactly balances the Rule 2 potential, unusually low to start with.""
Donovan rose to his feet in excitement. ""And it strikes an equilibrium. I see. Rule 3 drives him back and Rule 2 drives him forward - ""
""So he follows a circle around the selenium pool, staying on the locus of all points of potential equilibrium. And unless we do something about it, he'll stay on that circle forever, giving us the good old runaround."" Then, more thoughtfully: ""And that, by the way, is what makes him drunk. At potential equilibrium, half the positronic paths of his brain are out of kilter. I'm not a robot specialist, but that seems obvious. Probably he's lost control of just those parts of his voluntary mechanism that a human drunk has. Ve-e-ery pretty.""

""But what's the danger? If we knew what he was running from-!' ""You suggested it. Volcanic action. Somewhere right above the selenium pool is a seepage of gas from the bowels of Mercury. Sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide-and carbon monoxide. Lots of it and at this temperature.""
Donovan gulped audibly. ""Carbon monoxide plus iron gives the volatile iron carbonyl.""

""And a robot,"" added Powell, ""is essentially iron."" Then, grimly: ""There's nothing like deduction. We've determined everything about our problem but the solution. We can't get the selenium ourselves. It's still too far. We can't. send these robot horses, because they can't go themselves, and they can't carry us fast enough to keep us from crisping. And we can't catch Speedy, because the dope thinks we're playing games, and he can run sixty miles to our four.""

""If one of us goes,"" began Donovan, tentatively, ""and comes back cooked, there'll still be the other.""

""Yes,"" came the sarcastic reply, ""it would be a most tender sacrifice - except that a person would be in no condition to give orders before he ever reaches the pool, and I don't think the robots would ever turn back to the cliff without orders. Figure it out! We're two or three miles from the pool-call it two-the robot travels at four miles an hour; and we can last twenty minutes in our suits. It isn't only the beat, remember. Solar radiation out here in the ultraviolet and below is poison.""

""Um-m-m,"" said Donovan, ""ten minutes short,""

""As good as an eternity. And another thing. In Order for Rule 3 potential to have stopped Speedy where it did, there must be an appreciable amount of carbon monoxide in the metal-vapor atmosphere-and there must be an appreciable corrosive action therefore. He's been out hours now-and how do we know when a knee joint, for instance, won't be thrown out of kilter and keel him over. It's not only a question of thinking-we've got to think fast!"" Deep, dark, dank dismal silence!

Donovan broke it, voice trembling in an effort to keep itself emotionless. He said: ""As long as we can't increase Rule 2 potential by giving further orders, how about working the other way? If we increase the danger, we increase Rule 3 potential and drive him backward.""

Powell's visiplate had turned toward him in a silent question.

""You see,"" came the cautious explanation, ""all we need to do to drive him out of his rut is to increase the concentration of carbon monoxide in his vicinity. Well, back at the Station there's a complete analytical laboratory.""

""Naturally,"" assented Powell. ""It's a Mining Station.""

""All right. There must be pounds of oxalic acid for calcium precipitations.""

""Holy space! Mike, you're a genius.""

""So-so,"" admitted Donovan, modestly. ""It's just a case of remembering that oxalic acid on beating decomposes into carbon dioxide, water, and good old carbon monoxide. College chem, you know.""

Powell was on his feet and had attracted the attention of one of the monster robots by the simple expedient of pounding the machine's thigh.

""Hey,"" he shouted, ""can you throw?""

""Master?""

""Never mind."" Powell damned the robot's molasses-slow brain. He scrabbled up a jagged brick-size rock. ""Take this;' he said, ""and hit the patch of bluish crystals just across that crooked fissure. You see it?""

Donovan pulled at his shoulder. ""Too far, Greg. It's almost half a mile off.""

""Quiet,"" replied Powell. ""It's a case of Mercurian gravity and a steel throwing arm. Watch, will you?""

The robot's eyes were measuring the distance with machinery accurate stereoscopy. His arm adjusted itself to the weight of the missile and drew back. In the darkness, the robot's motions went unseen, but there was a sudden thumping sound as he shifted his weight, and seconds later the rock flew blackly into the sunlight. There was no air resistance to slow it down, nor wind to turn"" it aside-and when it hit the ground it threw up crystals precisely in the center of the ""blue patch.""

Powell yelled happily and shouted, ""Let's go back after the oxalic acid, Mike.""

And as they plunged into the ruined substation on the way back to the tunnels, Donovan said grimly: ""Speedy's been hanging about on this side of the selenium pool, ever since we chased after him. Did you see him?""

'Yes.

""I guess he wants to play games. Well, we'll play him games!""

They were back hours later, with three-liter jars of the white chemical and a pair of long faces, The photo-cell banks were deteriorating more rapidly than had seemed likely. The two steered their robots into the sunlight and toward the waiting Speedy in silence and with grim purpose.
Speedy galloped slowly toward them. ""Here we are again. Whee! I've made a little list, the piano organist; all people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face.""

""We'll puff something in your face,"" muttered Donovan. ""He's limping, Greg.""

""I noticed that,"" came the low, worried response. ""The monoxide'll get him yet, if we don't hurry.""
They were approaching cautiously now, almost sidling, to refrain from setting off the thoroughly irrational robot. Powell was too far off to tell, of course, but even already he could have sworn the crack-brained Speedy was setting himself for a spring.

""Let her go,"" he gasped. ""Count three! One-two-""

Two steel arms drew back and snapped forward simultaneously and two glass jars whirled forward in towering parallel arcs, gleaming like diamonds in the impossible sun. And in a pair of soundless puffs, they bit the ground behind Speedy in crashes that sent the oxalic acid flying like dust.
In the full heat of Mercury's sun, Powell knew it was fizzing like soda water.

Speedy turned to stare, then backed away from it slowly-and as slowly gathered speed. In fifteen seconds, he was leaping directly toward the two humans in an unsteady canter.

Powell did not get Speedy's words just then, though he heard something that resembled, ""Lover's professions when uttered in Hessians.""

He turned away. ""Back to the cliff, Mike. He's out of the rut and he'll be taking orders now. I'm getting hot.""
They jogged toward the shadow at the slow monotonous pace of their mounts, and it was not until they had entered it and felt the sudden coolness settle softly about them that Donovan looked back. ""Greg!""

Powell looked and almost shrieked. Speedy was moving slowly now - so slowly - and in the wrong direction. He was drifting; drifting back into his rut; and he was picking up speed. He looked dreadfully close, and dreadfully unreachable, in the binoculars.
Donovan shouted wildly, ""After him!"" and thumped his robot into its pace, but Powell called him back.

""You won't catch him, Mike - it's no use."" He fidgeted on his robot's shoulders and clenched his fist in tight impotence. ""Why the devil do I see these things five seconds after it's all over? Mike, we've wasted hours.""

""We need more oxalic acid,"" declared Donovan, stolidly. ""The concentration wasn't high enough.""

""Seven tons of it wouldn't have been enough-and we haven't the hours to spare to get it, even if it were, with the monoxide chewing him away. Don't you see what it is, Mike?""

And Donovan said flatly, ""No.""

""We were only establishing new equilibriums. When we create new monoxide and increase Rule 3 potential, he moves backward till he's in balance again-and when the monoxide drifted away, he moved forward, and again there was balance.""

Powell's voice sounded thoroughly wretched. ""It's the same old runaround. We can push at Rule 2 and pull at Rule 3 and we can't get anywhere-we can only change the position of balance. We've got to get outside both rules."" And then he pushed his robot closer to Donovan's so that they were sitting face to face, dim shadows in the darkness, and he whispered, ""Mike!""

""Is it the finish?"" - dully. ""I suppose we go back to the Station, wait for the banks to fold, shake hands, take cyanide, and go out like gentlemen."" He laughed shortly.

""Mike,"" repeated Powell earnestly, ""we've got to get Speedy.""

""I know.""

""Mike,"" once more, and Powell hesitated before continuing. ""There's always Rule 1. I thought of it earlier-but it's desperate.""

Donovan looked up and his voice livened. ""We're desperate.""

""All right. According to Rule 1, a robot can't see a human come to harm because of his own inaction. Two and 3 can't stand against it. Theycan't,Mike.""

""Even when the robot is half cra- Well, he's drunk. You know he is.""

""It's the chances you take.""

""Cut it. What are you going to do?""

""I'm going out there now and see what Rule 1 will do. If it won't break the balance, then what the devil - it's either now or three-four days from now.""

""Hold on, Greg. There are human rules of behavior, too. You don't go out there just like that. Figure out a lottery, and give memychance.""

""All right. First to get the cube of fourteen goes."" And almost immediately, ""Twenty-seven forty-four!""

Donovan felt his robot stagger at a sudden push by Powell's mount and then Powell was off into the sunlight. Donovan opened his mouth to shout, and then clicked it shut. Of course, the damn fool had worked out the cube of fourteen in advance, and on purpose. Just like him.

The sun was hotter than ever and Powell felt a maddening itch in the small of his back. Imagination, probably, or perhaps hard radiation beginning to tell even through the insosuit.

Speedy was watching him, without a word of Gilbert and Sullivan gibberish as greeting. Thank God for that! But he daren't get too close. He was three hundred yards away when Speedy began backing, a step at a time, cautiously - and Powell stopped. He jumped from his robot's shoulders and landed on the crystalline ground with a light thump and a flying of jagged fragments.

He proceeded on foot, the ground gritty and slippery to his steps, the low gravity causing him difficulty. The soles of his feet tickled with warmth. He cast one glance over his shoulder at the blackness of the cliffs shadow and realized that he had come too far to return -either by himself or by the help of his antique robot. It was Speedy or nothing now, and the knowledge of that constricted his chest. Far enough! He stopped.

""Speedy,"" he called. ""Speedy!""

The sleek, modem robot ahead of him hesitated and halted his backward steps, then resumed them.

Powell tried to put a note of pleading into his voice, and found it didn't take much acting. ""Speedy, I've got to get back to the shadow or the sun'll get me. It's life or death, Speedy. I need you.""

Speedy took one step forward and stopped. He spoke, but at the sound Powell groaned, for it was, ""When you're lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is tabooed - ""

It trailed off there, and Powell took time out for some reason to murmur, ""Iolanthe.""

It was roasting hot! He caught a movement out of the corner of his eye, and whirled dizzily; then stared in utter astonishment, for the monstrous robot on which he had ridden was moving-moving toward him, and without a rider.

He was talking: ""Pardon, Master. I must not move without a Master upon me, but you are in danger.""

Of course, Rule 1 potential above everything. But he didn't want that clumsy antique; he wanted Speedy. He walked away and motioned frantically: ""I order you to stay away. I order you to stop!""

It was quite useless. You could not beat Rule 1 potential. The robot said stupidly, ""You are in danger, Master.""

Powell looked about him desperately. He couldn't see clearly. His brain was in a heated whirl; his breath scorched when he breathed, and the ground all about him was a shimmering haze.

He called a last time, desperately: ""Speedy! I'm dying, damn you! Where are you? Speedy, I need you.""

He was still stumbling backward in a blind effort to get away from the giant robot he didn't want, when he felt steel fingers on his arms, and a worried, apologetic voice of metallic timbre in his cars.

""Holy smokes, boss, what are you doing here? And what am I doing - I'm so confused - ""

""Never mind,"" murmured Powell, weakly. ""Get me to the shadow of the cliff - and hurry!"" There was one last feeling of being lifted into the air and a sensation of rapid motion and burning beat, and he passed out.

He woke with Donovan bending over him and smiling anxiously. ""How are you, Greg?""

""Fine!"" came the response. ""Where's Speedy?"" ""Right here. I sent him out to one of the other selenium pools with orders to get that selenium at all cost this time. He got it back in forty-two minutes and three seconds. I timed him. He still hasn't finished apologizing for the runaround he gave us. He's scared to come near you for fear of what you'll say.""

""Drag him over,"" ordered Powell. ""It wasn't his fault."" He held out a hand and gripped Speedy's metal paw. ""It's O.K., Speedy."" Then, to Donovan, ""You know, Mike, I was just thinking - ""

""Yes!""

""Well,"" he rubbed his face-the air was so delightfully cool, ""you know that when we get things set up here and Speedy put through his Field Tests, they're going to send us to the Space Station next.""

""Yes! At least that's what old lady Calvin told me just before we left, and I didn't say anything about it, because I was going to fight the whole idea.""

""Fight it?"" cried Donovan. ""But - ""

""I know. It's all right with me now. Two hundred seventy-three degrees Centigrade below zero. Won't it be a pleasure?""

Would you leave me alone in my tears
Knowing I need you so
Would you still turn and go

This time be different please stay

And I wanted to give you my heart
But now you came back after living me one time
Oh I knew, oh how I knew that the heartaches would start

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

326,I Never Knew,"[1st verse]
You’re always dying inside that much closer to home
On a crowded street corner surrounded by people all alone
Pain in the heart, rain in the dark, the womb is glum and bitter
She walks around the corner, it’s like she brought the sun with her
Then everything just brightened up, I couldn’t make this up
My fingers in my eyes as she walked by like I was waking up
And so many words, I couldn’t string a sentence together to bother her
I instantly forgot all my plans and started to follow her

[Hook]
It’s like the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me

[2nd verse]
Your legs are long and toned, you must be walking home
I love the way your lips move when you’re talking on your phone
Intoxicating, truly due to your impurities
Plague every thought of you while I’m trailing you like you’re security
Lost, we couldn’t know our paths would cross but time knew it
Feet sticking out the window, a opportunity climbing through it
Pain for sale, looking to find a new taker
Chance to speak blown, when you looked at me I looked in the newspaper

[Hook]
Because the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me

[3rd verse]
I’m miles out of my way, creepy, I want more
Was gonna turn back but you stuck your key in your front door
I’m standing across the street, stars that aligned us to meet
Standing outside with your trash feeling incomplete
My finger aching for your doorbell like a random blog
Instead I lurk outside in the cold like an abandoned dog
Perish the thought, you should cherish the words that I got in my mouth
The only words that can truly explain how I got in your house

[4th verse]
Because the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me
Unlikely, impossible, I couldn’t dream to think it
There’s something happening between us you can’t deceive
I’m so in over my head I’ve learned to breathe in it
Your eyes are screaming and you’re saying no baby to me
If there was a way out I think you would’ve taken it
My hands and arms are the only way that you can leave
Face to face for the first time, you feel what I’m feeling
Selfishly no longer breathing because of me",Cage,1961,"[62, 56, 57, 68, 90]",5

332,Mr. Happiness,"If you need some to having fun
Or just to work or satisfy
If you want something in the morning
Or some else late at night

Just call me I'll be there
To give you all you want
You will be all right in a moment
And have a pleasant time

What do you prefer the yellow
And blue, the red or white
California dreams, moroccan
Or just colombian stuff

I'm Mr. Hapiness
If you want more or less
Show me the colour of your money
Cause the solution is in my pocket

I'm the guy that you wait
The man that you need and then you find me
I've got the best things
That you can ever try

I`m mr. Happiness...",Dr. Calypso,1961,"[87, 57, 60, 74, 98]",5
333,Girls Girls Girls (Part II),"      An ambitious poem to an ambitious girl with aim,
Destined to make a name

To end up well in fame,
Knows well to play a game.

Knows it a lot to play
To get there in a way,
To make a mark to stay
To have a brightened day.

Brightened enough that she can face
The hurdle with full grace
To have, set up the pace
For her glory in its place.

The glory as it does make, her good enough for our sake
My ambitious girl is so strengthened to take
Success right at its wake.

Though she took her time not to fail,
But of doubt it did bail
With strength to make it sail
Far enough for joy to mail.

A poem now well made,
Risks to face for it bade
Against all odds to raid
Its efforts, no her efforts
Have been paid.

Now why chatter about delusion and enlightenment?
Listening to the night rain on my roof

As I can't bare with the fact that I haven't met you yet boo
I sit comfortably, with both legs stretched out",Tebu avo xxiv,1961,"[96, 99]",2
334,Yellow Bird,"Yellow bird, up high in banana tree
Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me
Did your lady friend leave the nest again?
That is very bad, Makes me feel so sad
You can fly away, In the sky away
You more lucky than me

I also have a handsome friend
(he not with me today)
They all the same, the handsome friends
Make 'em the nest. Then they fly away

Yellow bird, up high in banana tree
Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me
Better fly away, In the sky away
Picker coming soon, Pick from night to noon
Black and yellow you, Like banana too
They may pick you some day

Wish that I was a yellow bird
I fly away with you
But I am not a yellow bird
So I sit, nothing else to do

Hut for the double hut kid of the month!
Dag who touched the sweets to my all that
Tweedle dee, bumble bee, kick the funky def!
Who's gonna play? Back for show & tell
Too young to have a love so I call him fairy-tale

[Verse 2]
Well see I'm the rave, uh, the R-A-V-E-N

Give a dog a mic and have some candy handy!
Roll 'em over, roll 'em over, bake them in a pan!
I'm the little girl who baked the ginger bread man, understand?
Diggy diggy dumb you understood and
You can thank me for showing Mike how to jam
Kris how to jump, Jordan how to dunk
En Vogue how to sing, Devante how to swing!
This is what girls are made of, sugar spice and I'm the one who's nice
I got more rhymes than Cosby got shows!
Got more ""knows"" than Humpty got nose!
I support the women of zaggah, zaggah in my bag
I put my drawers in my hands so my pants won't sag-uh!

Come and talk to me from the Jo-Jodeci!
Reminisce, see if I can get with Mary B
Cause I'm not the one, not the one to play
But get your ball and ya bat cause this song is a hit!
If ya see what I see, then see what I bring!

349,Moody River,"Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

Last Saturday evening
Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me

On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read ""Dear Love, I've done you wrong
Now I must set you free""

No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend

Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

I looked into the muddy waters
And what did I see
I saw a lonely, lonely face
Just looking back at me

Tears in his eyes
Ang a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips

Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life",Dr. Watson,1961,"[36, 22, 16, 12, 7, 6, 3, 1, 2, 7, 14, 31, 54, 74, 95]",15
350,Every Beat Of My Heart,"Through these misty eyes I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country
Heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
But don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour

And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the
Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart

351,Travelin' Man,"[Hook: Mac Miller]
Memories don't live like people do, they always remember you
Whether things are good or bad, it's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do baby don't forget me
I'm a travelin' man, movin' through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But Lord willin' I'm comin' back to you, baby boo
I'm a travelin' man, movin' through places space and time
Got a lot of things I got to do
But God willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I keep my bags packed always back on the road
Headed back to baby girl right after the show
But now I got clothes, hoes, piff, and kicks
Always twist a couple spiffs while I'm in the whip
First thing I need the gas, hit the pump fill the tank up
Tell my homie at the register to stay up
I'm on the parkway feelin' like the straight month
Goin' through the tunnel bout to break up
Phone gets hanged up, tunes turned way up the max
Hit the L twice then pass it to the back
Breathe, my meditation comin' in from recreation
Ain't no pause or hesitation, tryna' to catch my respiration
I ain't never had no patience, so I'm hardly ever waitin'
Just creatin' money makin', with creative preparation
Sick of all these cats with false representation
Two big of words ? maybe need some translation
Intellectual boy, figurative with language
And that there, that ain't shit
Uh, you feel me? The High Life and I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
My plane comin' down and I'm happy to land
Every time I got to go my girl grabbin' my hand
Tryna' to pull me back to her, and as mad as I am
I gotta make this money I'm a travelin' man
So through airplane, boat, or packed in a van
Baby I'mma hurry back to you as fast as I can
It don't matter what I gotta do, dreams I gotta follow you
Love is what I fall into, and ever do I follow through
So I'mma put it all on you, just know that I ain't got a clue
But baby I be watchin' you, and coppin' you some Prada shoes
Hurt me when I watch the news, the doctor's in the hospitals
Tryna' to heal the sick, but all their chances is impossible
Givin' the word like literature
Spittin' the verse, for all of those who live in the Burg
I travel the word the land and the seas
Here to open up your mind, just hand me the key

Yeah?

Mama if I meet a real fine boy
And he says that I'm his pride and joy
Or if he walks me in the [?]
Oh and he say he want to hold me tight
What might I say, mama, oh tell me what must I say? (What must I say)?

Tell him no, girl, tell that man
Tell him no make him understand
Unless he’s got a preacher in his plans
Tell him no, you better tell him no

But mama if he say he loves me so
And he say he'll never let me go
Or if he tell me that tonight's the night
And that he’s gonna make me see the light
What must I say, oh tell me, mama, what must I say?

Tell him no girl and take my advice
Keep his hands off the merchandie
Unless he's thinking about [?] and rice
Tell him no, you better tell him no

Supposin he's fine
Girl I hate to see you cryin
If he go he won't come back
There's another train moving on the very same track

But maybe maybe I can't let him go
Or maybe when he stay I feel that glow
If I tell him no with all my might
Oh still he say he want to hold me tight
What must I say, mama oh tell me what must I say

Tell him no girl and play your part
Don't want to see you with a broken heart

Should I fuck with industry or should I refuse
Should I tell everybody I love, ""I love you""

Should I stay tonight, or should I say goodbye, goodbye
Should I love this girl? no I won't even try
Should I feel ashamed? no, but should I feel proud
Would I be the same if I wasn't that high, nigga
Should I be earthbounded when my head's in the sky
Should I be generous if I wanna be liked
Should I be omnipresent to keep up this psych

Die Besten unter sich (ja), unsre Sätze hab'n Gewicht (ja)
Du nur ein Blender, sicher kein Banger (nein)

Oh, yeah, alright, hmm

[Verse 1]
Gather 'round guys
It's time to start listening
Practice makes perfect
But perfect's not working
There's a lot more to music
Than knowing where your cue's gonna be
You can play all the right notes
But that don't mean you're moving me

But if you can jump like David Lee Roth
Or pump your fist like your Bruce ""The Boss""

If you got a heart and soul
You can rock and roll
Rock and roll

Strumming
Drumming
Slide across from running
The stage is your home if you learn how to own it
Like the great steed
There's no way that you can fake it
You've got to feel the beat before you can move
Even though you're not wearing blue suede shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Making mistakes
But that won't matter
If you can swagg like 'ol Mick Jagger

If you got a heart and soul
You can rock and roll
You can rock and roll

If you live and you die
For the music inside
If the one for five never gets sold

Then you can rock and roll

Alright now take it low
Now I need the spotlight to hit right here
As the crowd starts to cheer

Boys and girls wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers tryin to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

[Verse 2]
Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die
She said-nigga I know about pain cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I been through more shit that you can't even relate to

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

Yo way hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, stop the breakin' yo
Stop the breakin'
You should you ain't gonna be going out
Like this men

[Bridge]
Hold up!
What would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
What would you do?
Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
Come on, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby you can do it

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money

361,Take A Fool's Advice,"(Charles Singleton)

If you love her
And she makes one mistake
Please don't leave her
It would make your heart ache
Take a fool's advice
Don't pay the price I had to pay

If you need her
But you're letting her go
Please don't do it
You'll be sorry, I know
Take a fool's advice
Don't pay the price I had to pay

Truly
She's caused you to doubt her
Truly
She's broken the rules
But life's not worth living without her
So listen to the wisdom of a fool

Think it over
And forgive her this time
I was foolish
I lost the love that was mine
Take a fool's advice
Don't pay the price I had to pay

Take a fool's advice
Don't pay the price I had to pay",Nat King Cole,1961,"[77, 71, 77, 81, 87, 88, 100]",7

363,The Bells Are Ringing,"The bells are ringing
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round
They hear the instructions
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound

The bells are ringing
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round (the bells are ringing the song they're singing the sound is)
They hear the instructions (bringing the people 'round)
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound (they travel great distances to the sound)

They are persuaded by the music of the bells
They're not responsible for anything they do
(No) The people know
(No) The way to go
The bells are ringing, they hear the sound

They hear the sound (they hear the sound)
They hear the sound (they hear the sound)
They hear the sound (they hear the sound)
They hear the sound

The bells are ringing
And everyone's walking
With arms extended in a trance
Forgetting their washing
Neglecting the children
They're dropping all businesses at hand

A voice is telling them to act a different way
They tilt their heads so they won't miss what it will say
(No) And when it's so
(No) There's this to know
The bells are ringing, they hear the sound

The bells are ringing
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round
They hear the instructions
They follow directions
They travel great distances to the sound

They are persuaded by the music of the bells
They're not responsible for anything they do
(No) The people know
(No) The way to go
The bells are ringing, they hear the sound

A girl with cotton in her ears
Is shielded from the bells' effect
As if by hidden signal
The people turn to face her
One thousand eyes are staring
They pull away her earplugs

The bells are pealing
And they're revealing
The simple key to happiness
It isn't evil
It isn't good
It's only what the people miss

The bells explain what they've been lacking all along
They were disorganized and that was what was wrong
(No) And now they know
(No) The way to go
The bells are ringing, they hear the sound

The bells are ringing
The song they're singing
The sound is bringing the people 'round (the bells are ringing the song they're singing the sound is)

All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded
Girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Aww yeah, aww yeah, my sound is what up right now
I've been down, but I'm up right now
Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'
Through that lane that you left open
Man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate, is it true?

You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business
But I just got one question, baby
Tell me why?

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Started from the bottom like Drake said
You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead
My squad'll  kick in your door where that safe at
No Atari, games girl I don't play that
If she broke I don’t acknowledge her, everything I say I follow up
What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin' on these hoes
Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us
Made a little money, still ain't got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open, don't say nothin'
Motor geeked up like a razor
You don't know me, you must mistake me
For somebody else
But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him
I had to tell her that

367,Bobby,"[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna

371,La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life),"When I think of Elizabeth Taylor
And many's the times I do
I think what that poor kid puts up with
And it tears my heart in two

She's out every night in a swank cabaret
Gets breakfast in bed on a solid gold tray
I hear that she earns seven thousand a day
""What kind of life is that""?

She gets what she wants irregardless* of price
Yeah, ""Did you see her ring, that was some chunk of ice?""
Why, she has thirty minks that she's never worn twice
""What kind of life is that""?

What kind of life, what kind of life, what kind of life is that?
Facing snakes and other dangers
Making love to perfect strangers
I read in the news she buys booze by the vat
Now, ""What kind of life is that""?

Poor Liz, poor Liz
Does she know what it means to make a pot roast last a week
To wrap a towel around a pipe in case it springs a leak
Does she know what it means to get down on her hands and knees
To wash her kid's pajamas or her old man's BVDs?

These simple pleasures don't delight her
She's too busy with la dolce viter*

Wherever she goes something thrilling occurs
She goes out to dine and the restaurant stirs
She's had twenty husbands, yeah, ""Five of them hers!""
""What kind of life is that""?

I'm sure Liz must think things look dandy so far
But will she, like poor Sybil*, one day wear a scar
Will she wind up too with a rock-and-roll star
""What kind of life is that""?

What kind of life, what kind of life, what kind of life is that?
At MGM they silver-spooned her
I think 'National Velvet'* ruined her
I pay for a house what she pays for hat
""What kind of life is that""?

They packed up the crew at the Fox Studio
They headed for Egypt, but Nasser* said, ""No""
They wouldn't let her in, she's Jewish, you know
""What kind of life is that""?

So for all of her glamour and her whoop-tee-doo
And her house in the best neighborhood
Would you take that lousy life if it was offered to you
You can bet Cleopatra's asp, you would!

379,The Graduation Song... Pomp And Circumstance,"What is an American

I wish I could be acquainted with the feelings and thoughts which must agitate the heart and present themselves to the mind of an enlightened Englishman, when he first lands on this continent. He must greatly rejoice that he lived at a time to see this fair country discovered and settled; he must necessarily feel a share of national pride, when he views the chain of settlements which embellishes these extended shores. When he says to himself, this is the work of my countrymen, who, when convulsed by factions, afflicted by a variety of miseries and wants, restless and impatient, took refuge here. They brought along with them their national genius, to which they principally owe what liberty they enjoy, and what substance they possess. Here he sees the industry of his native country displayed in a new manner, and traces in their works the embryos of all the arts, sciences, and ingenuity which nourish in Europe. Here he beholds fair cities, substantial villages, extensive fields, an immense country filled with decent houses, good roads, orchards, meadows, and bridges, where an hundred years ago all was wild, woody, and uncultivated! What a train of pleasing ideas this fair spectacle must suggest; it is a prospect which must inspire a good citizen with the most heartfelt pleasure. The difficulty consists in the manner of viewing so extensive a scene. He is arrived on a new continent; a modern society offers itself to his contemplation, different from what he had hitherto seen. It is not composed, as in Europe, of great lords who possess everything, and of a herd of people who have nothing. Here are no aristocratical families, no courts, no kings, no bishops, no ecclesiastical dominion, no invisible power giving to a few a very visible one; no great manufacturers employing thousands, no great refinements of luxury. The rich and the poor are not so far removed from each other as they are in Europe. Some few towns excepted, we are all tillers of the earth, from Nova Scotia to West Florida. We are a people of cultivators, scattered over an immense territory, communicating with each other by means of good roads and navigable rivers, united by the silken bands of mild government, all respecting the laws, without dreading their power, because they are equitable. We are all animated with the spirit of an industry which is unfettered and unrestrained, because each person works for himself. If he travels through our rural districts he views not the hostile castle, and the haughty mansion, contrasted with the clay- built hut and miserable cabin, where cattle and men help to keep each other warm, and dwell in meanness, smoke, and indigence. A pleasing uniformity of decent competence appears throughout our habitations. The meanest of our log-houses is a dry and comfortable habitation. Lawyer or merchant are the fairest titles our towns afford; that of a farmer is the only appellation of the rural inhabitants of our country. It must take some time ere he can reconcile himself to our dictionary, which is but short in words of dignity, and names of honour. There, on a Sunday, he sees a congregation of respectable farmers and their wives, all clad in neat homespun, well mounted, or riding in their own humble waggons. There is not among them an esquire, saving the unlettered magistrate. There he sees a parson as simple as his flock, a farmer who does not riot on the labour of others. We have no princes, for whom we toil, starve, and bleed: we are the most perfect society now existing in the world. Here man is free as he ought to be; nor is this pleasing equality so transitory as many others are. Many ages will not see the shores of our great lakes replenished with inland nations, nor the unknown bounds of North America entirely peopled. Who can tell how far it extends? Who can tell the millions of men whom it will feed and contain? for no European foot has as yet travelled half the extent of this mighty continent!

The next wish of this traveller will be to know whence came all these people? they are a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes. From this promiscuous breed, that race now called Americans have arisen. The eastern provinces must indeed be excepted, as being the unmixed descendants of Englishmen. I have heard many wish that they had been more intermixed also: for my part, I am no wisher, and think it much better as it has happened. They exhibit a most conspicuous figure in this great and variegated picture; they too enter for a great share in the pleasing perspective displayed in these thirteen provinces. I know it is fashionable to reflect on them, but I respect them for what they have done; for the accuracy and wisdom with which they have settled their territory; for the decency of their manners; for their early love of letters; their ancient college, the first in this hemisphere; for their industry; which to me who am but a farmer, is the criterion of everything. There never was a people, situated as they are, who with so ungrateful a soil have done more in so short a time. Do you think that the monarchical ingredients which are more prevalent in other governments, have purged them from all foul stains? Their histories assert the contrary.

In this great American asylum, the poor of Europe have by some means met together, and in consequence of various causes; to what purpose should they ask one another what countrymen they are? Alas, two thirds of them had no country. Can a wretch who wanders about, who works and starves, whose life is a continual scene of sore affliction or pinching penury; can that man call England or any other kingdom his country? A country that had no bread for him, whose fields procured him no harvest, who met with nothing but the frowns of the rich, the severity of the laws, with jails and punishments; who owned not a single foot of the extensive surface of this planet? No! urged by a variety of motives, here they came. Every thing has tended to regenerate them; new laws, a new mode of living, a new social system; here they are become men: in Europe they were as so many useless plants, wanting vegetative mould, and refreshing showers; they withered, and were mowed down by want, hunger, and war; but now by the power of transplantation, like all other plants they have taken root and flourished! Formerly they were not numbered in any civil lists of their country, except in those of the poor; here they rank as citizens. By what invisible power has this surprising metamorphosis been performed? By that of the laws and that of their industry. The laws, the indulgent laws, protect them as they arrive, stamping on them the symbol of adoption; they receive ample rewards for their labours; these accumulated rewards procure them lands; those lands confer on them the title of freemen, and to that title every benefit is affixed which men can possibly require. This is the great operation daily performed by our laws. From whence proceed these laws? From our government. Whence the government? It is derived from the original genius and strong desire of the people ratified and confirmed by the crown. This is the great chain which links us all, this is the picture which every province exhibits, Nova Scotia excepted.

There the crown has done all; either there were no people who had genius, or it was not much attended to: the consequence is, that the province is very thinly inhabited indeed; the power of the crown in conjunction with the musketos has prevented men from settling there. Yet some parts of it flourished once, and it contained a mild harmless set of people. But for the fault of a few leaders, the whole were banished. The greatest political error the crown ever committed in America, was to cut off men from a country which wanted nothing but men!

What attachment can a poor European emigrant have for a country where he had nothing? The knowledge of the language, the love of a few kindred as poor as himself, were the only cords that tied him: his country is now that which gives him land, bread, protection, and consequence: Ubi panis ibi patria, is the motto of all emigrants. What then is the American, this new man? He is either an European, or the descendant of an European, hence that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country. I could point out to you a family whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife was Dutch, whose son married a French woman, and whose present four sons have now four wives of different nations. He is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds. He becomes an American by being received in the broad lap of our great Alma Mater. Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men, whose labours and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world. Americans are the western pilgrims, who are carrying along with them that great mass of arts, sciences, vigour, and industry which began long since in the east; they will finish the great circle. The Americans were once scattered all over Europe; here they are incorporated into one of the finest systems of population which has ever appeared, and which will hereafter become distinct by the power of the different climates they inhabit. The American ought therefore to love this country much better than that wherein either he or his forefathers were born. Here the rewards of his industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labour; his labour is founded on the basis of nature, SELF-INTEREST: can it want a stronger allurement? Wives and children, who before in vain demanded of him a morsel of bread, now, fat and frolicsome, gladly help their father to clear those fields whence exuberant crops are to arise to feed and to clothe them all; without any part being claimed, either by a despotic prince, a rich abbot, or a mighty lord. Here religion demands but little of him; a small voluntary salary to the minister, and gratitude to God; can he refuse these? The American is a new man, who acts upon new principles; he must therefore entertain new ideas, and form new opinions. From involuntary idleness, servile dependence, penury, and useless labour, he has passed to toils of a very different nature, rewarded by ample subsistence.—This is an American.

British America is divided into many provinces, forming a large association, scattered along a coast 1500 miles extent and about 200 wide. This society I would fain examine, at least such as it appears in the middle provinces; if it does not afford that variety of tinges and gradations which may be observed in Europe, we have colours peculiar to ourselves. For instance, it is natural to conceive that those who live near the sea, must be very different from those who live in the woods; the intermediate space will afford a separate and distinct class.

Men are like plants; the goodness and flavour of the fruit proceeds from the peculiar soil and exposition in which they grow. We are nothing but what we derive from the air we breathe, the climate we inhabit, the government we obey, the system of religion we profess, and the nature of our employment. Here you will find but few crimes; these have acquired as yet no root among us. I wish I was able to trace all my ideas; if my ignorance prevents me from describing them properly, I hope I shall be able to delineate a few of the outlines, which are all I propose.

Those who live near the sea, feed more on fish than on flesh, and often encounter that boisterous element. This renders them more bold and enterprising; this leads them to neglect the confined occupations of the land. They see and converse with a variety of people, their intercourse with mankind becomes extensive. The sea inspires them with a love of traffic, a desire of transporting produce from one place to another; and leads them to a variety of resources which supply the place of labour. Those who inhabit the middle settlements, by far the most numerous, must be very different; the simple cultivation of the earth purifies them, but the indulgences of the government, the soft remonstrances of religion, the rank of independent freeholders, must necessarily inspire them with sentiments, very little known in Europe among people of the same class. What do I say? Europe has no such class of men; the early knowledge they acquire, the early bargains they make, give them a great degree of sagacity. As freemen they will be litigious; pride and obstinacy are often the cause of law suits; the nature of our laws and governments may be another. As citizens it is easy to imagine, that they will carefully read the newspapers, enter into every political disquisition, freely blame or censure governors and others. As farmers they will be careful and anxious to get as much as they can, because what they get is their own. As northern men they will love the cheerful cup. As Christians, religion curbs them not in their opinions; the general indulgence leaves every one to think for themselves in spiritual matters; the laws inspect our actions, our thoughts are left to God. Industry, good living, selfishness, litigiousness, country politics, the pride of freemen, religious indifference, are their characteristics. If you recede still farther from the sea, you will come into more modern settlements; they exhibit the same strong lineaments, in a ruder appearance. Religion seems to have still less influence, and their manners are less improved.

Now we arrive near the great woods, near the last inhabited districts; there men seem to be placed still farther beyond the reach of government, which in some measure leaves them to themselves. How can it pervade every corner; as they were driven there by misfortunes, necessity of beginnings, desire of acquiring large tracts of land, idleness, frequent want of economy, ancient debts; the re-union of such people does not afford a very pleasing spectacle. When discord, want of unity and friendship; when either drunkenness or idleness prevail in such remote districts; contention, inactivity, and wretchedness must ensue. There are not the same remedies to these evils as in a long established community. The few magistrates they have, are in general little better than the rest; they are often in a perfect state of war; that of man against man, sometimes decided by blows, sometimes by means of the law; that of man against every wild inhabitant of these venerable woods, of which they are come to dispossess them. There men appear to be no better than carnivorous animals of a superior rank, living on the flesh of wild animals when they can catch them, and when they are not able, they subsist on grain. He who would wish to see America in its proper light, and have a true idea of its feeble beginnings and barbarous rudiments, must visit our extended line of frontiers where the last settlers dwell, and where he may see the first labours of settlement, the mode of clearing the earth, in all their different appearances; where men are wholly left dependent on their native tempers, and on the spur of uncertain industry, which often fails when not sanctified by the efficacy of a few moral rules. There, remote from the power of example and check of shame, many families exhibit the most hideous parts of our society. They are a kind of forlorn hope, preceding by ten or twelve years the most respectable army of veterans which come after them. In that space, prosperity will polish some, vice and the law will drive off the rest, who uniting again with others like themselves will recede still farther; making room for more industrious people, who will finish their improvements, convert the loghouse into a convenient habitation, and rejoicing that the first heavy labours are finished, will change in a few years that hitherto barbarous country into a fine fertile, well regulated district. Such is our progress, such is the march of the Europeans toward the interior parts of this continent. In all societies there are off-casts; this impure part serves as our precursors or pioneers; my father himself was one of that class, but he came upon honest principles, and was therefore one of the few who held fast; by good conduct and temperance, he transmitted to me his fair inheritance, when not above one in fourteen of his contemporaries had the same good fortune.

Forty years ago this smiling country was thus inhabited; it is now purged, a general decency of manners prevails throughout, and such has been the fate of our best countries.

Exclusive of those general characteristics, each province has its own, founded on the government, climate, mode of husbandry, customs, and peculiarity of circumstances. Europeans submit insensibly to these great powers, and become, in the course of a few generations, not only Americans in general, but either Pennsylvanians, Virginians, or provincials under some other name. Whoever traverses the continent must easily observe those strong differences, which will grow more evident in time. The inhabitants of Canada, Massachusetts, the middle provinces, the southern ones will be as different as their climates; their only points of unity will be those of religion and language.

As I have endeavoured to show you how Europeans become Americans; it may not be disagreeable to show you likewise how the various Christian sects introduced, wear out, and how religious indifference becomes prevalent. When any considerable number of a particular sect happen to dwell contiguous to each other, they immediately erect a temple, and there worship the Divinity agreeably to their own peculiar ideas. Nobody disturbs them. If any new sect springs up in Europe it may happen that many of its professors will come and settle in American. As they bring their zeal with them, they are at liberty to make proselytes if they can, and to build a meeting and to follow the dictates of their consciences; for neither the government nor any other power interferes. If they are peaceable subjects, and are industrious, what is it to their neighbours how and in what manner they think fit to address their prayers to the Supreme Being? But if the sectaries are not settled close together, if they are mixed with other denominations, their zeal will cool for want of fuel, and will be extinguished in a little time. Then the Americans become as to religion, what they are as to country, allied to all. In them the name of Englishman, Frenchman, and European is lost, and in like manner, the strict modes of Christianity as practised in Europe are lost also. This effect will extend itself still farther hereafter, and though this may appear to you as a strange idea, yet it is a very true one. I shall be able perhaps hereafter to explain myself better; in the meanwhile, let the following example serve as my first justification.

Let us suppose you and I to be travelling; we observe that in this house, to the right, lives a Catholic, who prays to God as he has been taught, and believes in transubstantiation; he works and raises wheat, he has a large family of children, all hale and robust; his belief, his prayers offend nobody. About one mile farther on the same road, his next neighbour may be a good honest plodding German Lutheran, who addresses himself to the same God, the God of all, agreeably to the modes he has been educated in, and believes in consubstantiation; by so doing he scandalises nobody; he also works in his fields, embellishes the earth, clears swamps, etc. What has the world to do with his Lutheran principles? He persecutes nobody, and nobody persecutes him, he visits his neighbours, and his neighbours visit him. Next to him lives a seceder, the most enthusiastic of all sectaries; his zeal is hot and fiery, but separated as he is from others of the same complexion, he has no congregation of his own to resort to, where he might cabal and mingle religious pride with worldly obstinacy. He likewise raises good crops, his house is handsomely painted, his orchard is one of the fairest in the neighbourhood. How does it concern the welfare of the country, or of the province at large, what this man's religious sentiments are, or really whether he has any at all? He is a good farmer, he is a sober, peaceable, good citizen: William Penn himself would not wish for more. This is the visible character, the invisible one is only guessed at, and is nobody's business. Next again lives a Low Dutchman, who implicitly believes the rules laid down by the synod of Dort. He conceives no other idea of a clergyman than that of an hired man; if he does his work well he will pay him the stipulated sum; if not he will dismiss him, and do without his sermons, and let his church be shut up for years. But notwithstanding this coarse idea, you will find his house and farm to be the neatest in all the country; and you will judge by his waggon and fat horses, that he thinks more of the affairs of this world than of those of the next. He is sober and laborious, therefore he is all he ought to be as to the affairs of this life; as for those of the next, he must trust to the great Creator. Each of these people instruct their children as well as they can, but these instructions are feeble compared to those which are given to the youth of the poorest class in Europe. Their children will therefore grow up less zealous and more indifferent in matters of religion than their parents. The foolish vanity, or rather the fury of making Proselytes, is unknown here; they have no time, the seasons call for all their attention, and thus in a few years, this mixed neighbourhood will exhibit a strange religious medley, that will be neither pure Catholicism nor pure Calvinism. A very perceptible indifference even in the first generation, will become apparent; and it may happen that the daughter of the Catholic will marry the son of the seceder, and settle by themselves at a distance from their parents. What religious education will they give their children? A very imperfect one. If there happens to be in the neighbourhood any place of worship, we will suppose a Quaker's meeting; rather than not show their fine clothes, they will go to it, and some of them may perhaps attach themselves to that society. Others will remain in a perfect state of indifference; the children of these zealous parents will not be able to tell what their religious principles are, and their grandchildren still less. The neighbourhood of a place of worship generally leads them to it, and the action of going thither, is the strongest evidence they can give of their attachment to any sect. The Quakers are the only people who retain a fondness for their own mode of worship; for be they ever so far separated from each other, they hold a sort of communion with the society, and seldom depart from its rules, at least in this country. Thus all sects are mixed as well as all nations; thus religious indifference is imperceptibly disseminated from one end of the continent to the other; which is at present one of the strongest characteristics of the Americans. Where this will reach no one can tell, perhaps it may leave a vacuum fit to receive other systems. Persecution, religious pride, the love of contradiction, are the food of what the world commonly calls religion. These motives have ceased here; zeal in Europe is confined; here it evaporates in the great distance it has to travel; there it is a grain of powder inclosed, here it burns away in the open air, and consumes without effect.

But to return to our back settlers. I must tell you, that there is something in the proximity of the woods, which is very singular. It is with men as it is with the plants and animals that grow and live in the forests; they are entirely different from those that live in the plains. I will candidly tell you all my thoughts but you are not to expect that I shall advance any reasons. By living in or near the woods, their actions are regulated by the wildness of the neighbourhood. The deer often come to eat their grain, the wolves to destroy their sheep, the bears to kill their hogs, the foxes to catch their poultry. This surrounding hostility immediately puts the gun into their hands; they watch these animals, they kill some; and thus by defending their property, they soon become professed hunters; this is the progress; once hunters, farewell to the plough. The chase renders them ferocious, gloomy, and unsociable; a hunter wants no neighbour, he rather hates them, because he dreads the competition. In a little time their success in the woods makes them neglect their tillage. They trust to the natural fecundity of the earth, and therefore do little; carelessness in fencing often exposes what little they sow to destruction; they are not at home to watch; in order therefore to make up the deficiency, they go oftener to the woods. That new mode of life brings along with it a new set of manners, which I cannot easily describe. These new manners being grafted on the old stock, produce a strange sort of lawless profligacy, the impressions of which are indelible. The manners of the Indian natives are respectable, compared with this European medley. Their wives and children live in sloth and inactivity; and having no proper pursuits, you may judge what education the latter receive. Their tender minds have nothing else to contemplate but the example of their parents; like them they grow up a mongrel breed, half civilised, half savage, except nature stamps on them some constitutional propensities. That rich, that voluptuous sentiment is gone that struck them so forcibly; the possession of their freeholds no longer conveys to their minds the same pleasure and pride. To all these reasons you must add, their lonely situation, and you cannot imagine what an effect on manners the great distances they live from each other has! Consider one of the last settlements in its first view: of what is it composed? Europeans who have not that sufficient share of knowledge they ought to have, in order to prosper; people who have suddenly passed from oppression, dread of government, and fear of laws, into the unlimited freedom of the woods. This sudden change must have a very great effect on most men, and on that class particularly. Eating of wild meat, whatever you may think, tends to alter their temper: though all the proof I can adduce, is, that I have seen it: and having no place of worship to resort to, what little society this might afford is denied them. The Sunday meetings, exclusive of religious benefits, were the only social bonds that might have inspired them with some degree of emulation in neatness. Is it then surprising to see men thus situated, immersed in great and heavy labours, degenerate a little? It is rather a wonder the effect is not more diffusive. The Moravians and the Quakers are the only instances in exception to what I have advanced. The first never settle singly, it is a colony of the society which emigrates; they carry with them their forms, worship, rules, and decency: the others never begin so hard, they are always able to buy improvements, in which there is a great advantage, for by that time the country is recovered from its first barbarity. Thus our bad people are those who are half cultivators and half hunters; and the worst of them are those who have degenerated altogether into the hunting state. As old ploughmen and new men of the woods, as Europeans and new made Indians, they contract the vices of both; they adopt the moroseness and ferocity of a native, without his mildness, or even his industry at home. If manners are not refined, at least they are rendered simple and inoffensive by tilling the earth; all our wants are supplied by it, our time is divided between labour and rest, and leaves none for the commission of great misdeeds. As hunters it is divided between the toil of the chase, the idleness of repose, or the indulgence of inebriation. Hunting is but a licentious idle life, and if it does not always pervert good dispositions; yet, when it is united with bad luck, it leads to want: want stimulates that propensity to rapacity and injustice, too natural to needy men, which is the fatal gradation. After this explanation of the effects which follow by living in the woods, shall we yet vainly flatter ourselves with the hope of converting the Indians? We should rather begin with converting our back- settlers; and now if I dare mention the name of religion, its sweet accents would be lost in the immensity of these woods. Men thus placed are not fit either to receive or remember its mild instructions; they want temples and ministers, but as soon as men cease to remain at home, and begin to lead an erratic life, let them be either tawny or white, they cease to be its disciples.

Thus have I faintly and imperfectly endeavoured to trace our society from the sea to our woods! yet you must not imagine that every person who moves back, acts upon the same principles, or falls into the same degeneracy. Many families carry with them all their decency of conduct, purity of morals, and respect of religion; but these are scarce, the power of example is sometimes irresistible. Even among these back-settlers, their depravity is greater or less, according to what nation or province they belong. Were I to adduce proofs of this, I might be accused of partiality. If there happens to be some rich intervals, some fertile bottoms, in those remote districts, the people will there prefer tilling the land to hunting, and will attach themselves to it; but even on these fertile spots you may plainly perceive the inhabitants to acquire a great degree of rusticity and selfishness.

It is in consequence of this straggling situation, and the astonishing power it has on manners, that the back-settlers of both the Carolinas, Virginia, and many other parts, have been long a set of lawless people; it has been even dangerous to travel among them. Government can do nothing in so extensive a country, better it should wink at these irregularities, than that it should use means inconsistent with its usual mildness. Time will efface those stains: in proportion as the great body of population approaches them they will reform, and become polished and subordinate. Whatever has been said of the four New England provinces, no such degeneracy of manners has ever tarnished their annals; their back-settlers have been kept within the bounds of decency, and government, by means of wise laws, and by the influence of religion. What a detestable idea such people must have given to the natives of the Europeans! They trade with them, the worst of people are permitted to do that which none but persons of the best characters should be employed in. They get drunk with them, and often defraud the Indians. Their avarice, removed from the eyes of their superiors, knows no bounds; and aided by the little superiority of knowledge, these traders deceive them, and even sometimes shed blood. Hence those shocking violations, those sudden devastations which have so often stained our frontiers, when hundreds of innocent people have been sacrificed for the crimes of a few. It was in consequence of such behaviour, that the Indians took the hatchet against the Virginians in 1774. Thus are our first steps trod, thus are our first trees felled, in general, by the most vicious of our people; and thus the path is opened for the arrival of a second and better class, the true American freeholders; the most respectable set of people in this part of the world: respectable for their industry, their happy independence, the great share of freedom they possess, the good regulation of their families, and for extending the trade and the dominion of our mother country.

Europe contains hardly any other distinctions but lords and tenants; this fair country alone is settled by freeholders, the possessors of the soil they cultivate, members of the government they obey, and the framers of their own laws, by means of their representatives. This is a thought which you have taught me to cherish; our difference from Europe, far from diminishing, rather adds to our usefulness and consequence as men and subjects. Had our forefathers remained there, they would only have crowded it, and perhaps prolonged those convulsions which had shook it so long. Every industrious European who transports himself here, may be compared to a sprout growing at the foot of a great tree; it enjoys and draws but a little portion of sap; wrench it from the parent roots, transplant it, and it will become a tree bearing fruit also. Colonists are therefore entitled to the consideration due to the most useful subjects; a hundred families barely existing in some parts of Scotland, will here in six years, cause an annual exportation of 10,000 bushels of wheat: 100 bushels being but a common quantity for an industrious family to sell, if they cultivate good land. It is here then that the idle may be employed, the useless become useful, and the poor become rich; but by riches I do not mean gold and silver, we have but little of those metals; I mean a better sort of wealth, cleared lands, cattle, good houses, good clothes, and an increase of people to enjoy them.

There is no wonder that this country has so many charms, and presents to Europeans so many temptations to remain in it. A traveller in Europe becomes a stranger as soon as he quits his own kingdom; but it is otherwise here. We know, properly speaking, no strangers; this is every person's country; the variety of our soils, situations, climates, governments, and produce, hath something which must please everybody. No sooner does an European arrive, no matter of what condition, than his eyes are opened upon the fair prospect; he hears his language spoke, he retraces many of his own country manners, he perpetually hears the names of families and towns with which he is acquainted; he sees happiness and prosperity in all places disseminated; he meets with hospitality, kindness, and plenty everywhere; he beholds hardly any poor, he seldom hears of punishments and executions; and he wonders at the elegance of our towns, those miracles of industry and freedom. He cannot admire enough our rural districts, our convenient roads, good taverns, and our many accommodations; he involuntarily loves a country where everything is so lovely. When in England, he was a mere Englishman; here he stands on a larger portion of the globe, not less than its fourth part, and may see the productions of the north, in iron and naval stores; the provisions of Ireland, the grain of Egypt, the indigo, the rice of China. He does not find, as in Europe, a crowded society, where every place is over-stocked; he does not feel that perpetual collision of parties, that difficulty of beginning, that contention which oversets so many. There is room for everybody in America; has he any particular talent, or industry? he exerts it in order to procure a livelihood, and it succeeds. Is he a merchant? the avenues of trade are infinite; is he eminent in any respect? he will be employed and respected. Does he love a country life? pleasant farms present themselves; he may purchase what he wants, and thereby become an American farmer. Is he a labourer, sober and industrious? he need not go many miles, nor receive many informations before he will be hired, well fed at the table of his employer, and paid four or five times more than he can get in Europe. Does he want uncultivated lands? thousands of acres present themselves, which he may purchase cheap. Whatever be his talents or inclinations, if they are moderate, he may satisfy them. I do not mean that every one who comes will grow rich in a little time; no, but he may procure an easy, decent maintenance, by his industry. Instead of starving he will be fed, instead of being idle he will have employment; and these are riches enough for such men as come over here. The rich stay in Europe, it is only the middling and the poor that emigrate. Would you wish to travel in independent idleness, from north to south, you will find easy access, and the most cheerful reception at every house; society without ostentation, good cheer without pride, and every decent diversion which the country affords, with little expense. It is no wonder that the European who has lived here a few years, is desirous to remain; Europe with all its pomp, is not to be compared to this continent, for men of middle stations, or labourers.

An European, when he first arrives, seems limited in his intentions, as well as in his views; but he very suddenly alters his scale; two hundred miles formerly appeared a very great distance, it is now but a trifle; he no sooner breathes our air than he forms schemes, and embarks in designs he never would have thought of in his own country. There the plenitude of society confines many useful ideas, and often extinguishes the most laudable schemes which here ripen into maturity. Thus Europeans become Americans.

But how is this accomplished in that crowd of low, indigent people, who flock here every year from all parts of Europe? I will tell you; they no sooner arrive than they immediately feel the good effects of that plenty of provisions we possess: they fare on our best food, and they are kindly entertained; their talents, character, and peculiar industry are immediately inquired into; they find countrymen everywhere disseminated, let them come from whatever part of Europe. Let me select one as an epitome of the rest; he is hired, he goes to work, and works moderately; instead of being employed by a haughty person, he finds himself with his equal, placed at the substantial table of the farmer, or else at an inferior one as good; his wages are high, his bed is not like that bed of sorrow on which he used to lie: if he behaves with propriety, and is faithful, he is caressed, and becomes as it were a member of the family. He begins to feel the effects of a sort of resurrection; hitherto he had not lived, but simply vegetated; he now feels himself a man, because he is treated as such; the laws of his own country had overlooked him in his insignificancy; the laws of this cover him with their mantle. Judge what an alteration there must arise in the mind and thoughts of this man; he begins to forget his former servitude and dependence, his heart involuntarily swells and glows; this first swell inspires him with those new thoughts which constitute an American. What love can he entertain for a country where his existence was a burthen to him; if he is a generous good man, the love of this new adoptive parent will sink deep into his heart. He looks around, and sees many a prosperous person, who but a few years before was as poor as himself. This encourages him much, he begins to form some little scheme, the first, alas, he ever formed in his life. If he is wise he thus spends two or three years, in which time he acquires knowledge, the use of tools, the modes of working the lands, felling trees, etc. This prepares the foundation of a good name, the most useful acquisition he can make. He is encouraged, he has gained friends; he is advised and directed, he feels bold, he purchases some land; he gives all the money he has brought over, as well as what he has earned, and trusts to the God of harvests for the discharge of the rest. His good name procures him credit. He is now possessed of the deed, conveying to him and his posterity the fee simple and absolute property of two hundred acres of land, situated on such a river. What an epocha in this man's life! He is become a freeholder, from perhaps a German boor—he is now an American, a Pennsylvanian, an English subject. He is naturalised, his name is enrolled with those of the other citizens of the province. Instead of being a vagrant, he has a place of residence; he is called the inhabitant of such a county, or of such a district, and for the first time in his life counts for something; for hitherto he has been a cypher. I only repeat what I have heard many say, and no wonder their hearts should glow, and be agitated with a multitude of feelings, not easy to describe. From nothing to start into being; from a servant to the rank of a master; from being the slave of some despotic prince, to become a free man, invested with lands, to which every municipal blessing is annexed! What a change indeed! It is in consequence of that change that he becomes an American. This great metamorphosis has a double effect, it extinguishes all his European prejudices, he forgets that mechanism of subordination, that servility of disposition which poverty had taught him; and sometimes he is apt to forget too much, often passing from one extreme to the other. If he is a good man, he forms schemes of future prosperity, he proposes to educate his children better than he has been educated himself; he thinks of future modes of conduct, feels an ardour to labour he never felt before. Pride steps in and leads him to everything that the laws do not forbid: he respects them; with a heart-felt gratitude he looks toward the east, toward that insular government from whose wisdom all his new felicity is derived, and under whose wings and protection he now lives. These reflections constitute him the good man and the good subject. Ye poor Europeans, ye, who sweat, and work for the great— ye, who are obliged to give so many sheaves to the church, so many to your lords, so many to your government, and have hardly any left for yourselves—ye, who are held in less estimation than favourite hunters or useless lap-dogs—ye, who only breathe the air of nature, because it cannot be withheld from you; it is here that ye can conceive the possibility of those feelings I have been describing; it is here the laws of naturalisation invite every one to partake of our great labours and felicity, to till unrented, untaxed lands! Many, corrupted beyond the power of amendment, have brought with them all their vices, and disregarding the advantages held to them, have gone on in their former career of iniquity, until they have been overtaken and punished by our laws. It is not every emigrant who succeeds; no, it is only the sober, the honest, and industrious: happy those to whom this transition has served as a powerful spur to labour, to prosperity, and to the good establishment of children, born in the days of their poverty; and who had no other portion to expect but the rags of their parents, had it not been for their happy emigration. Others again, have been led astray by this enchanting scene; their new pride, instead of leading them to the fields, has kept them in idleness; the idea of possessing lands is all that satisfies them—though surrounded with fertility, they have mouldered away their time in inactivity, misinformed husbandry, and ineffectual endeavours. How much wiser, in general, the honest Germans than almost all other Europeans; they hire themselves to some of their wealthy landsmen, and in that apprenticeship learn everything that is necessary. They attentively consider the prosperous industry of others, which imprints in their minds a strong desire of possessing the same advantages. This forcible idea never quits them, they launch forth, and by dint of sobriety, rigid parsimony, and the most persevering industry, they commonly succeed. Their astonishment at their first arrival from Germany is very great—it is to them a dream; the contrast must be powerful indeed; they observe their countrymen flourishing in every place; they travel through whole counties where not a word of English is spoken; and in the names and the language of the people, they retrace Germany. They have been an useful acquisition to this continent, and to Pennsylvania in particular; to them it owes some share of its prosperity: to their mechanical knowledge and patience it owes the finest mills in all America, the best teams of horses, and many other advantages. The recollection of their former poverty and slavery never quits them as long as they live.

The Scotch and the Irish might have lived in their own country perhaps as poor, but enjoying more civil advantages, the effects of their new situation do not strike them so forcibly, nor has it so lasting an effect. From whence the difference arises I know not, but out of twelve families of emigrants of each country, generally seven Scotch will succeed, nine German, and four Irish. The Scotch are frugal and laborious, but their wives cannot work so hard as German women, who on the contrary vie with their husbands, and often share with them the most severe toils of the field, which they understand better. They have therefore nothing to struggle against, but the common casualties of nature. The Irish do not prosper so well; they love to drink and to quarrel; they are litigious, and soon take to the gun, which is the ruin of everything; they seem beside to labour under a greater degree of ignorance in husbandry than the others; perhaps it is that their industry had less scope, and was less exercised at home. I have heard many relate, how the land was parcelled out in that kingdom; their ancient conquest has been a great detriment to them, by over-setting their landed property. The lands possessed by a few, are leased down ad infinitum, and the occupiers often pay five guineas an acre. The poor are worse lodged there than anywhere else in Europe; their potatoes, which are easily raised, are perhaps an inducement to laziness: their wages are too low, and their whisky too cheap.

There is no tracing observations of this kind, without making at the same time very great allowances, as there are everywhere to be found, a great many exceptions. The Irish themselves, from different parts of that kingdom, are very different. It is difficult to account for this surprising locality, one would think on so small an island an Irishman must be an Irishman: yet it is not so, they are different in their aptitude to, and in their love of labour.

The Scotch on the contrary are all industrious and saving; they want nothing more than a field to exert themselves in, and they are commonly sure of succeeding. The only difficulty they labour under is, that technical American knowledge which requires some time to obtain; it is not easy for those who seldom saw a tree, to conceive how it is to be felled, cut up, and split into rails and posts.

As I am fond of seeing and talking of prosperous families, I intend to finish this letter by relating to you the history of an honest Scotch Hebridean, who came here in 1774, which will show you in epitome what the Scotch can do, wherever they have room for the exertion of their industry. Whenever I hear of any new settlement, I pay it a visit once or twice a year, on purpose to observe the different steps each settler takes, the gradual improvements, the different tempers of each family, on which their prosperity in a great nature depends; their different modifications of industry, their ingenuity, and contrivance; for being all poor, their life requires sagacity and prudence. In the evening I love to hear them tell their stories, they furnish me with new ideas; I sit still and listen to their ancient misfortunes, observing in many of them a strong degree of gratitude to God, and the government. Many a well meant sermon have I preached to some of them. When I found laziness and inattention to prevail, who could refrain from wishing well to these new countrymen, after having undergone so many fatigues. Who could withhold good advice? What a happy change it must be, to descend from the high, sterile, bleak lands of Scotland, where everything is barren and cold, to rest on some fertile farms in these middle provinces! Such a transition must have afforded the most pleasing satisfaction.

The following dialogue passed at an out-settlement, where I lately paid a visit:

Well, friend, how do you do now; I am come fifty odd miles on purpose to see you; how do you go on with your new cutting and slashing? Very well, good Sir, we learn the use of the axe bravely, we shall make it out; we have a belly full of victuals every day, our cows run about, and come home full of milk, our hogs get fat of themselves in the woods: Oh, this is a good country! God bless the king, and William Penn; we shall do very well by and by, if we keep our healths. Your loghouse looks neat and light, where did you get these shingles? One of our neighbours is a New-England man, and he showed us how to split them out of chestnut-trees. Now for a barn, but all in good time, here are fine trees to build with. Who is to frame it, sure you don't understand that work yet? A countryman of ours who has been in America these ten years, offers to wait for his money until the second crop is lodged in it. What did you give for your land? Thirty-five shillings per acre, payable in seven years. How many acres have you got? An hundred and fifty. That is enough to begin with; is not your land pretty hard to clear? Yes, Sir, hard enough, but it would be harder still if it were ready cleared, for then we should have no timber, and I love the woods much; the land is nothing without them. Have not you found out any bees yet? No, Sir; and if we had we should not know what to do with them. I will tell you by and by. You are very kind. Farewell, honest man, God prosper you; whenever you travel toward——, inquire for J.S. He will entertain you kindly, provided you bring him good tidings from your family and farm. In this manner I often visit them, and carefully examine their houses, their modes of ingenuity, their different ways; and make them all relate all they know, and describe all they feel. These are scenes which I believe you would willingly share with me. I well remember your philanthropic turn of mind. Is it not better to contemplate under these humble roofs, the rudiments of future wealth and population, than to behold the accumulated bundles of litigious papers in the office of a lawyer? To examine how the world is gradually settled, how the howling swamp is converted into a pleasing meadow, the rough ridge into a fine field; and to hear the cheerful whistling, the rural song, where there was no sound heard before, save the yell of the savage, the screech of the owl or the hissing of the snake? Here an European, fatigued with luxury, riches, and pleasures, may find a sweet relaxation in a series of interesting scenes, as affecting as they are new. England, which now contains so many domes, so many castles, was once like this; a place woody and marshy; its inhabitants, now the favourite nation for arts and commerce, were once painted like our neighbours. The country will nourish in its turn, and the same observations will be made which I have just delineated. Posterity will look back with avidity and pleasure, to trace, if possible, the era of this or that particular settlement.

Pray, what is the reason that the Scots are in general more religious, more faithful, more honest, and industrious than the Irish? I do not mean to insinuate national reflections, God forbid! It ill becomes any man, and much less an American; but as I know men are nothing of themselves, and that they owe all their different modifications either to government or other local circumstances, there must be some powerful causes which constitute this great national difference.

Agreeable to the account which several Scotchmen have given me of the north of Britain, of the Orkneys, and the Hebride Islands, they seem, on many accounts, to be unfit for the habitation of men; they appear to be calculated only for great sheep pastures. Who then can blame the inhabitants of these countries for transporting themselves hither? This great continent must in time absorb the poorest part of Europe; and this will happen in proportion as it becomes better known; and as war, taxation, oppression, and misery increase there. The Hebrides appear to be fit only for the residence of malefactors, and it would be much better to send felons there than either to Virginia or Maryland. What a strange compliment has our mother country paid to two of the finest provinces in America! England has entertained in that respect very mistaken ideas; what was intended as a punishment, is become the good fortune of several; many of those who have been transported as felons, are now rich, and strangers to the stings of those wants that urged them to violations of the law: they are become industrious, exemplary, and useful citizens. The English government should purchase the most northern and barren of those islands; it should send over to us the honest, primitive Hebrideans, settle them here on good lands, as a reward for their virtue and ancient poverty; and replace them with a colony of her wicked sons. The severity of the climate, the inclemency of the seasons, the sterility of the soil, the tempestuousness of the sea, would afflict and punish enough. Could there be found a spot better adapted to retaliate the injury it had received by their crimes? Some of those islands might be considered as the hell of Great Britain, where all evil spirits should be sent. Two essential ends would be answered by this simple operation. The good people, by emigration, would be rendered happier; the bad ones would be placed where they ought to be. In a few years the dread of being sent to that wintry region would have a much stronger effect than that of transportation.—This is no place of punishment; were I a poor hopeless, breadless Englishman, and not restrained by the power of shame, I should be very thankful for the passage. It is of very little importance how, and in what manner an indigent man arrives; for if he is but sober, honest, and industrious, he has nothing more to ask of heaven. Let him go to work, he will have opportunities enough to earn a comfortable support, and even the means of procuring some land; which ought to be the utmost wish of every person who has health and hands to work. I knew a man who came to this country, in the literal sense of the expression, stark naked; I think he was a Frenchman, and a sailor on board an English man-of- war. Being discontented, he had stripped himself and swam ashore; where, finding clothes and friends, he settled afterwards at Maraneck, in the county of Chester, in the province of New York: he married and left a good farm to each of his sons. I knew another person who was but twelve years old when he was taken on the frontiers of Canada, by the Indians; at his arrival at Albany he was purchased by a gentleman, who generously bound him apprentice to a tailor. He lived to the age of ninety, and left behind him a fine estate and a numerous family, all well settled; many of them I am acquainted with.—Where is then the industrious European who ought to despair?

After a foreigner from any part of Europe is arrived, and become a citizen; let him devoutly listen to the voice of our great parent, which says to him, ""Welcome to my shores, distressed European; bless the hour in which thou didst see my verdant fields, my fair navigable rivers, and my green mountains!—If thou wilt work, I have bread for thee; if thou wilt be honest, sober, and industrious, I have greater rewards to confer on thee—ease and independence. I will give thee fields to feed and clothe thee; a comfortable fireside to sit by, and tell thy children by what means thou hast prospered; and a decent bed to repose on. I shall endow thee beside with the immunities of a freeman. If thou wilt carefully educate thy children, teach them gratitude to God, and reverence to that government, that philanthropic government, which has collected here so many men and made them happy. I will also provide for thy progeny; and to every good man this ought to be the most holy, the most powerful, the most earnest wish he can possibly form, as well as the most consolatory prospect when he dies. Go thou and work and till; thou shalt prosper, provided thou be just, grateful, and industrious.""

HISTORY OF ANDREW, THE HEBRIDEAN

Let historians give the detail of our charters, the succession of our several governors, and of their administrations; of our political struggles, and of the foundation of our towns: let annalists amuse themselves with collecting anecdotes of the establishment of our modern provinces: eagles soar high—I, a feebler bird, cheerfully content myself with skipping from bush to bush, and living on insignificant insects. I am so habituated to draw all my food and pleasure from the surface of the earth which I till, that I cannot, nor indeed am I able to quit it—I therefore present you with the short history of a simple Scotchman; though it contain not a single remarkable event to amaze the reader; no tragical scene to convulse the heart, or pathetic narrative to draw tears from sympathetic eyes. All I wish to delineate is, the progressive steps of a poor man, advancing from indigence to ease; from oppression to freedom; from obscurity and contumely to some degree of consequence—not by virtue of any freaks of fortune, but by the gradual operation of sobriety, honesty, and emigration. These are the limited fields, through which I love to wander; sure to find in some parts, the smile of new-born happiness, the glad heart, inspiring the cheerful song, the glow of manly pride excited by vivid hopes and rising independence. I always return from my neighbourly excursions extremely happy, because there I see good living almost under every roof, and prosperous endeavours almost in every field. But you may say, why don't you describe some of the more ancient, opulent settlements of our country, where even the eye of an European has something to admire? It is true, our American fields are in general pleasing to behold, adorned and intermixed as they are with so many substantial houses, flourishing orchards, and copses of woodlands; the pride of our farms, the source of every good we possess. But what I might observe there is but natural and common; for to draw comfortable subsistence from well fenced cultivated fields, is easy to conceive. A father dies and leaves a decent house and rich farm to his son; the son modernises the one, and carefully tills the other; marries the daughter of a friend and neighbour: this is the common prospect; but though it is rich and pleasant, yet it is far from being so entertaining and instructive as the one now in my view.

I had rather attend on the shore to welcome the poor European when he arrives, I observe him in his first moments of embarrassment, trace him throughout his primary difficulties, follow him step by step, until he pitches his tent on some piece of land, and realises that energetic wish which has made him quit his native land, his kindred, and induced him to traverse a boisterous ocean. It is there I want to observe his first thoughts and feelings, the first essays of an industry, which hitherto has been suppressed. I wish to see men cut down the first trees, erect their new buildings, till their first fields, reap their first crops, and say for the first time in their lives, ""This is our own grain, raised from American soil—on it we shall feed and grow fat, and convert the rest into gold and silver."" I want to see how the happy effects of their sobriety, honesty, and industry are first displayed: and who would not take a pleasure in seeing these strangers settling as new countrymen, struggling with arduous difficulties, overcoming them, and becoming happy.

Landing on this great continent is like going to sea, they must have a compass, some friendly directing needle; or else they will uselessly err and wander for a long time, even with a fair wind: yet these are the struggles through which our forefathers have waded; and they have left us no other records of them, but the possession of our farms. The reflections I make on these new settlers recall to my mind what my grandfather did in his days; they fill me with gratitude to his memory as well as to that government, which invited him to come, and helped him when he arrived, as well as many others. Can I pass over these reflections without remembering thy name, O Penn! thou best of legislators; who by the wisdom of thy laws hast endowed human nature, within the bounds of thy province, with every dignity it can possibly enjoy in a civilised state; and showed by thy singular establishment, what all men might be if they would follow thy example!

In the year 1770, I purchased some lands in the county of——, which I intended for one of my sons; and was obliged to go there in order to see them properly surveyed and marked out: the soil is good, but the country has a very wild aspect. However I observed with pleasure, that land sells very fast; and I am in hopes when the lad gets a wife, it will be a well-settled decent country. Agreeable to our customs, which indeed are those of nature, it is our duty to provide for our eldest children while we live, in order that our homesteads may be left to the youngest, who are the most helpless. Some people are apt to regard the portions given to daughters as so much lost to the family; but this is selfish, and is not agreeable to my way of thinking; they cannot work as men do; they marry young: I have given an honest European a farm to till for himself, rent free, provided he clears an acre of swamp every year, and that he quits it whenever my daughter shall marry. It will procure her a substantial husband, a good farmer—and that is all my ambition.

Whilst I was in the woods I met with a party of Indians; I shook hands with them, and I perceived they had killed a cub; I had a little Peach brandy, they perceived it also, we therefore joined company, kindled a large fire, and ate an hearty supper. I made their hearts glad, and we all reposed on good beds of leaves. Soon after dark, I was surprised to hear a prodigious hooting through the woods; the Indians laughed heartily. One of them, more skilful than the rest, mimicked the owls so exactly, that a very large one perched on a high tree over our fire. We soon brought him down; he measured five feet seven inches from one extremity of the wings to the other. By Captain——I have sent you the talons, on which I have had the heads of small candlesticks fixed. Pray keep them on the table of your study for my sake.

Contrary to my expectation, I found myself under the necessity of going to Philadelphia, in order to pay the purchase money, and to have the deeds properly recorded. I thought little of the journey, though it was above two hundred miles, because I was well acquainted with many friends, at whose houses I intended to stop. The third night after I left the woods, I put up at Mr.——'s, the most worthy citizen I know; he happened to lodge at my house when you was there.—He kindly inquired after your welfare, and desired I would make a friendly mention of him to you. The neatness of these good people is no phenomenon, yet I think this excellent family surpasses everything I know. No sooner did I lie down to rest than I thought myself in a most odoriferous arbour, so sweet and fragrant were the sheets. Next morning I found my host in the orchard destroying caterpillars. I think, friend B., said I, that thee art greatly departed from the good rules of the society; thee seemeth to have quitted that happy simplicity for which it hath hitherto been so remarkable. Thy rebuke, friend James, is a pretty heavy one; what motive canst thee have for thus accusing us? Thy kind wife made a mistake last evening, I said; she put me on a bed of roses, instead of a common one; I am not used to such delicacies. And is that all, friend James, that thee hast to reproach us with?—Thee wilt not call it luxury I hope? thee canst but know that it is the produce of our garden; and friend Pope sayeth, that ""to enjoy is to obey."" This is a most learned excuse indeed, friend B., and must be valued because it is founded upon truth. James, my wife hath done nothing more to thy bed than what is done all the year round to all the beds in the family; she sprinkles her linen with rose-water before she puts it under the press; it is her fancy, and I have nought to say. But thee shalt not escape so, verily I will send for her; thee and she must settle the matter, whilst I proceed on my work, before the sun gets too high.—Tom, go thou and call thy mistress Philadelphia. What. said I, is thy wife called by that name? I did not know that before. I'll tell thee, James, how it came to pass: her grandmother was the first female child born after William Penn landed with the rest of our brethren; and in compliment to the city he intended to build, she was called after the name he intended to give it; and so there is always one of the daughters of her family known by the name of Philadelphia. She soon came, and after a most friendly altercation, I gave up the point; breakfasted, departed, and in four days reached the city.

A week after news came that a vessel was arrived with Scotch emigrants. Mr. C. and I went to the dock to see them disembark. It was a scene which inspired me with a variety of thoughts; here are, said I to my friend, a number of people, driven by poverty, and other adverse causes, to a foreign land, in which they know nobody. The name of a stranger, instead of implying relief, assistance, and kindness, on the contrary, conveys very different ideas. They are now distressed; their minds are racked by a variety of apprehensions, fears, and hopes. It was this last powerful sentiment which has brought them here. If they are good people, I pray that heaven may realise them. Whoever were to see them thus gathered again in five or six years, would behold a more pleasing sight, to which this would serve as a very powerful contrast. By their honesty, the vigour of their arms, and the benignity of government, their condition will be greatly improved; they will be well clad, fat, possessed of that manly confidence which property confers; they will become useful citizens. Some of the posterity may act conspicuous parts in our future American transactions. Most of them appeared pale and emaciated, from the length of the passage, and the indifferent provision on which they had lived. The number of children seemed as great as that of the people; they had all paid for being conveyed here. The captain told us they were a quiet, peaceable, and harmless people, who had never dwelt in cities. This was a valuable cargo; they seemed, a few excepted, to be in the full vigour of their lives. Several citizens, impelled either by spontaneous attachments, or motives of humanity, took many of them to their houses; the city, agreeable to its usual wisdom and humanity, ordered them all to be lodged in the barracks, and plenty of provisions to be given them. My friend pitched upon one also and led him to his house, with his wife, and a son about fourteen years of age. The majority of them had contracted for land the year before, by means of an agent; the rest depended entirely upon chance; and the one who followed us was of this last class. Poor man, he smiled on receiving the invitation, and gladly accepted it, bidding his wife and son do the same, in a language which I did not understand. He gazed with uninterrupted attention on everything he saw; the houses, the inhabitants, the negroes, and carriages: everything appeared equally new to him; and we went slow, in order to give him time to feed on this pleasing variety. Good God! said he, is this Philadelphia, that blessed city of bread and provisions, of which we have heard so much? I am told it was founded the same year in which my father was born; why, it is finer than Greenock and Glasgow, which are ten times as old. It is so, said my friend to him, and when thee hast been here a month, thee will soon see that it is the capital of a fine province, of which thee art going to be a citizen: Greenock enjoys neither such a climate nor such a soil. Thus we slowly proceeded along, when we met several large Lancaster six-horse waggons, just arrived from the country. At this stupendous sight he stopped short, and with great diffidence asked us what was the use of these great moving houses, and where those big horses came from? Have you none such at home, I asked him? Oh, no; these huge animals would eat all the grass of our island! We at last reached my friend's house, who in the glow of well-meant hospitality, made them all three sit down to a good dinner, and gave them as much cider as they could drink. God bless this country, and the good people it contains, said he; this is the best meal's victuals I have made a long time.—I thank you kindly.

What part of Scotland dost thee come from, friend Andrew, said Mr. C.? Some of us come from the main, some from the island of Barra, he answered—I myself am a Barra man. I looked on the map, and by its latitude, easily guessed that it must be an inhospitable climate. What sort of land have you got there, I asked him? Bad enough, said he; we have no such trees as I see here, no wheat, no kine, no apples. Then, I observed, that it must be hard for the poor to live. We have no poor, he answered, we are all alike, except our laird; but he cannot help everybody. Pray what is the name of your laird? Mr. Neiel, said Andrew; the like of him is not to be found in any of the isles; his forefathers have lived there thirty generations ago, as we are told. Now, gentlemen, you may judge what an ancient family estate it must be. But it is cold, the land is thin, and there were too many of us, which are the reasons that some are come to seek their fortunes here. Well, Andrew, what step do you intend to take in order to become rich? I do not know, Sir; I am but an ignorant man, a stranger besides—I must rely on the advice of good Christians, they would not deceive me, I am sure. I have brought with me a character from our Barra minister, can it do me any good here? Oh, yes; but your future success will depend entirely on your own conduct; if you are a sober man, as the certificate says, laborious, and honest, there is no fear but that you will do well. Have you brought any money with you, Andrew? Yes, Sir, eleven guineas and an half. Upon my word it is a considerable sum for a Barra man; how came you by so much money? Why seven years ago I received a legacy of thirty-seven pounds from an uncle, who loved me much; my wife brought me two guineas, when the laird gave her to me for a wife, which I have saved ever since. I have sold all I had; I worked in Glasgow for some time. I am glad to hear you are so saving and prudent; be so still; you must go and hire yourself with some good people; what can you do? I can thresh a little, and handle the spade. Can you plough? Yes, Sir, with the little breast plough I have brought with me. These won't do here, Andrew; you are an able man; if you are willing you will soon learn. I'll tell you what I intend to do; I'll send you to my house, where you shall stay two or three weeks, there you must exercise yourself with the axe, that is the principal tool the Americans want, and particularly the back- settlers. Can your wife spin? Yes, she can. Well then as soon as you are able to handle the axe, you shall go and live with Mr. P. R., a particular friend of mine, who will give you four dollars per month, for the first six, and the usual price of five as long as you remain with him. I shall place your wife in another house, where she shall receive half a dollar a week for spinning; and your son a dollar a month to drive the team. You shall have besides good victuals to eat, and good beds to lie on; will all this satisfy you, Andrew? He hardly understood what I said; the honest tears of gratitude fell from his eyes as he looked at me, and its expressions seemed to quiver on his lips.—Though silent, this was saying a great deal; there was besides something extremely moving to see a man six feet high thus shed tears; and they did not lessen the good opinion I had entertained of him. At last he told me, that my offers were more than he deserved, and that he would first begin to work for his victuals. No, no, said I, if you are careful and sober, and do what you can, you shall receive what I told you, after you have served a short apprenticeship at my house. May God repay you for all your kindnesses, said Andrew; as long as I live I shall thank you, and do what I can for you. A few days after I sent them all three to——, by the return of some waggons, that he might have an opportunity of viewing, and convincing himself of the utility of those machines which he had at first so much admired.

The further descriptions he gave us of the Hebrides in general, and of his native island in particular; of the customs and modes of living of the inhabitants; greatly entertained me. Pray is the sterility of the soil the cause that there are no trees, or is it because there are none planted? What are the modern families of all the kings of the earth, compared to the date of that of Mr. Neiel? Admitting that each generation should last but forty years, this makes a period of 1200; an extraordinary duration for the uninterrupted descent of any family! Agreeably to the description he gave us of those countries, they seem to live according to the rules of nature, which gives them but bare subsistence; their constitutions are uncontaminated by any excess or effeminacy, which their soil refuses. If their allowance of food is not too scanty, they must all be healthy by perpetual temperance and exercise; if so, they are amply rewarded for their poverty. Could they have obtained but necessary food, they would not have left it; for it was not in consequence of oppression, either from their patriarch or the government, that they had emigrated. I wish we had a colony of these honest people settled in some parts of this province; their morals, their religion, seem to be as simple as their manners. This society would present an interesting spectacle could they be transported on a richer soil. But perhaps that soil would soon alter everything; for our opinions, vices, and virtues, are altogether local: we are machines fashioned by every circumstance around us.

Andrew arrived at my house a week before I did, and I found my wife, agreeable to my instructions, had placed the axe in his hands, as his first task. For some time he was very awkward, but he was so docile, so willing, and grateful, as well as his wife, that I foresaw he would succeed. Agreeably to my promise, I put them all with different families, where they were well liked, and all parties were pleased. Andrew worked hard, lived well, grew fat, and every Sunday came to pay me a visit on a good horse, which Mr. P. R. lent him. Poor man, it took him a long time ere he could sit on the saddle and hold the bridle properly. I believe he had never before mounted such a beast, though I did not choose to ask him that question, for fear it might suggest some mortifying ideas. After having been twelve months at Mr. P. R.'s, and having received his own and his family's wages, which amounted to eighty-four dollars; he came to see me on a week-day, and told me, that he was a man of middle age, and would willingly have land of his own, in order to procure him a home, as a shelter against old age: that whenever this period should come, his son, to whom he would give his land, would then maintain him, and thus live altogether; he therefore required my advice and assistance. I thought his desire very natural and praiseworthy, and told him that I should think of it, but that he must remain one month longer with Mr. P. R., who had 3000 rails to split. He immediately consented. The spring was not far advanced enough yet for Andrew to begin clearing any land even supposing that he had made a purchase; as it is always necessary that the leaves should be out, in order that this additional combustible may serve to burn the heaps of brush more readily.

A few days after, it happened that the whole family of Mr. P. R. went to meeting, and left Andrew to take care of the house. While he was at the door, attentively reading the Bible, nine Indians just come from the mountains, suddenly made their appearance, and unloaded their packs of furs on the floor of the piazza. Conceive, if you can, what was Andrew's consternation at this extraordinary sight! From the singular appearance of these people, the honest Hebridean took them for a lawless band come to rob his master's house. He therefore, like a faithful guardian, precipitately withdrew and shut the doors, but as most of our houses are without locks, he was reduced to the necessity of fixing his knife over the latch, and then flew upstairs in quest of a broadsword he had brought from Scotland. The Indians, who were Mr. P. R.'s particular friends, guessed at his suspicions and fears; they forcibly lifted the door, and suddenly took possession of the house, got all the bread and meat they wanted, and sat themselves down by the fire. At this instant Andrew, with his broadsword in his hand, entered the room; the Indians earnestly looking at him, and attentively watching his motions. After a very few reflections, Andrew found that his weapon was useless, when opposed to nine tomahawks; but this did not diminish his anger, on the contrary; it grew greater on observing the calm impudence with which they were devouring the family provisions. Unable to resist, he called them names in broad Scotch, and ordered them to desist and be gone; to which the Indians (as they told me afterwards) replied in their equally broad idiom. It must have been a most unintelligible altercation between this honest Barra man, and nine Indians who did not much care for anything he could say. At last he ventured to lay his hands on one of them, in order to turn him out of the house. Here Andrew's fidelity got the better of his prudence; for the Indian, by his motions, threatened to scalp him, while the rest gave the war hoop. This horrid noise so effectually frightened poor Andrew, that, unmindful of his courage, of his broadsword, and his intentions, he rushed out, left them masters of the house, and disappeared. I have heard one of the Indians say since, that he never laughed so heartily in his life. Andrew at a distance, soon recovered from the fears which had been inspired by this infernal yell, and thought of no other remedy than to go to the meeting-house, which was about two miles distant. In the eagerness of his honest intentions, with looks of affright still marked on his countenance, he called Mr. P. R. out, and told him with great vehemence of style, that nine monsters were come to his house—some blue, some red, and some black; that they had little axes in their hands out of which they smoked; and that like highlanders, they had no breeches; that they were devouring all his victuals, and that God only knew what they would do more. Pacify yourself, said Mr. P. R., my house is as safe with these people, as if I was there myself; as for the victuals, they are heartily welcome, honest Andrew; they are not people of much ceremony; they help themselves thus whenever they are among their friends; I do so too in their wigwams, whenever I go to their village: you had better therefore step in and hear the remainder of the sermon, and when the meeting is over we will all go back in the waggon together.

At their return, Mr. P. R., who speaks the Indian language very well, explained the whole matter; the Indians renewed their laugh, and shook hands with honest Andrew, whom they made to smoke out of their pipes; and thus peace was made, and ratified according to the Indian custom, by the calumet.

Soon after this adventure, the time approached when I had promised Andrew my best assistance to settle him; for that purpose I went to Mr. A. V. in the county of——, who, I was informed, had purchased a tract of land, contiguous to——settlement. I gave him a faithful detail of the progress Andrew had made in the rural arts; of his honesty, sobriety, and gratitude, and pressed him to sell him an hundred acres. This I cannot comply with, said Mr. A. V., but at the same time I will do better; I love to encourage honest Europeans as much as you do, and to see them prosper: you tell me he has but one son; I will lease them an hundred acres for any term of years you please, and make it more valuable to your Scotchman than if he was possessed of the fee simple. By that means he may, with what little money he has, buy a plough, a team, and some stock; he will not be incumbered with debts and mortgages; what he raises will be his own; had he two or three sons as able as himself, then I should think it more eligible for him to purchase the fee simple. I join with you in opinion, and will bring Andrew along with me in a few days.

Well, honest Andrew, said Mr. A. V., in consideration of your good name, I will let you have an hundred acres of good arable land, that shall be laid out along a new road; there is a bridge already erected on the creek that passes through the land, and a fine swamp of about twenty acres. These are my terms, I cannot sell, but I will lease you the quantity that Mr. James, your friend, has asked; the first seven years you shall pay no rent, whatever you sow and reap, and plant and gather, shall be entirely your own; neither the king, government, nor church, will have any claim on your future property: the remaining part of the time you must give me twelve dollars and an half a year; and that is all you will have to pay me. Within the three first years you must plant fifty apple trees, and clear seven acres of swamp within the first part of the lease; it will be your own advantage: whatever you do more within that time, I will pay you for it, at the common rate of the country. The term of the lease shall be thirty years; how do you like it, Andrew? Oh, Sir, it is very good, but I am afraid, that the king or his ministers, or the governor, or some of our great men, will come and take the land from me; your son may say to me, by and by, this is my father's land, Andrew, you must quit it. No, no, said Mr. A. V., there is no such danger; the king and his ministers are too just to take the labour of a poor settler; here we have no great men, but what are subordinate to our laws; but to calm all your fears, I will give you a lease, so that none can make you afraid. If ever you are dissatisfied with the land, a jury of your own neighbourhood shall value all your improvements, and you shall be paid agreeably to their verdict. You may sell the lease, or if you die, you may previously dispose of it, as if the land was your own. Expressive, yet inarticulate joy, was mixed in his countenance, which seemed impressed with astonishment and confusion. Do you understand me well, said Mr. A. V.? No, Sir, replied Andrew, I know nothing of what you mean about lease, improvement, will, jury, etc. That is honest, we will explain these things to you by and by. It must be confessed that those were hard words, which he had never heard in his life; for by his own account, the ideas they convey would be totally useless in the island of Barra. No wonder, therefore, that he was embarrassed; for how could the man who had hardly a will of his own since he was born, imagine he could have one after his death? How could the person who never possessed anything, conceive that he could extend his new dominion over this land, even after he should be laid in his grave? For my part, I think Andrew's amazement did not imply any extraordinary degree of ignorance; he was an actor introduced upon a new scene, it required some time ere he could reconcile himself to the part he was to perform. However he was soon enlightened, and introduced into those mysteries with which we native Americans are but too well acquainted.

Here then is honest Andrew, invested with every municipal advantage they confer; become a freeholder, possessed of a vote, of a place of residence, a citizen of the province of Pennsylvania. Andrew's original hopes and the distant prospects he had formed in the island of Barra, were at the eve of being realised; we therefore can easily forgive him a few spontaneous ejaculations, which would be useless to repeat. This short tale is easily told; few words are sufficient to describe this sudden change of situation; but in his mind it was gradual, and took him above a week before he could be sure, that without disturbing any money he could possess lands. Soon after he prepared himself; I lent him a barrel of pork, and 200 lb. weight of meal, and made him purchase what was necessary besides.

He set out, and hired a room in the house of a settler who lived the most contiguous to his own land. His first work was to clear some acres of swamp, that he might have a supply of hay the following year for his two horses and cows. From the first day he began to work, he was indefatigable; his honesty procured him friends, and his industry the esteem of his new neighbours. One of them offered him two acres of cleared land, whereon he might plant corn, pumpkins, squashes, and a few potatoes, that very season. It is astonishing how quick men will learn when they work for themselves. I saw with pleasure two months after, Andrew holding a two-horse plough and tracing his furrows quite straight; thus the spade man of the island of Barra was become the tiller of American soil. Well done, said I, Andrew, well done; I see that God speeds and directs your works; I see prosperity delineated in all your furrows and head lands. Raise this crop of corn with attention and care, and then you will be master of the art.

As he had neither mowing nor reaping to do that year, I told him that the time was come to build his house; and that for the purpose I would myself invite the neighbourhood to a frolic; that thus he would have a large dwelling erected, and some upland cleared in one day. Mr. P. R., his old friend, came at the time appointed, with all his hands, and brought victuals in plenty: I did the same. About forty people repaired to the spot; the songs, and merry stories, went round the woods from cluster to cluster, as the people had gathered to their different works; trees fell on all sides, bushes were cut up and heaped; and while many were thus employed, others with their teams hauled the big logs to the spot which Andrew had pitched upon for the erection of his new dwelling. We all dined in the woods; in the afternoon the logs were placed with skids, and the usual contrivances: thus the rude house was raised, and above two acres of land cut up, cleared, and heaped.

Whilst all these different operations were performing, Andrew was absolutely incapable of working; it was to him the most solemn holiday he had ever seen; it would have been sacrilegious in him to have denied it with menial labour. Poor man, he sanctified it with joy and thanksgiving, and honest libations—he went from one to the other with the bottle in his hand, pressing everybody to drink, and drinking himself to show the example. He spent the whole day in smiling, laughing, and uttering monosyllables: his wife and son were there also, but as they could not understand the language, their pleasure must have been altogether that of the imagination. The powerful lord, the wealthy merchant, on seeing the superb mansion finished, never can feel half the joy and real happiness which was felt and enjoyed on that day by this honest Hebridean: though this new dwelling, erected in the midst of the woods, was nothing more than a square inclosure, composed of twenty-four large clumsy logs, let in at the ends. When the work was finished, the company made the woods resound with the noise of their three cheers, and the honest wishes they formed for Andrew's prosperity. He could say nothing, but with thankful tears he shook hands with them all. Thus from the first day he had landed, Andrew marched towards this important event: this memorable day made the sun shine on that land on which he was to sow wheat and other grain. What swamp he had cleared lay before his door; the essence of future bread, milk, and meat, were scattered all round him. Soon after he hired a carpenter, who put on a roof and laid the floors; in a week more the house was properly plastered, and the chimney finished. He moved into it, and purchased two cows, which found plenty of food in the woods—his hogs had the same advantage. That very year, he and his son sowed three bushels of wheat, from which he reaped ninety-one and a half; for I had ordered him to keep an exact account of all he should raise. His first crop of other corn would have been as good, had it not been for the squirrels, which were enemies not to be dispersed by the broadsword. The fourth year I took an inventory of the wheat this man possessed, which I send you. Soon after, further settlements were made on that road, and Andrew, instead of being the last man towards the wilderness, found himself in a few years in the middle of a numerous society. He helped others as generously as others had helped him; and I have dined many times at his table with several of his neighbours. The second year he was made overseer of the road, and served on two petty juries, performing as a citizen all the duties required of him. The historiographer of some great prince or general, does not bring his hero victorious to the end of a successful campaign, with one half of the heart-felt pleasure with which I have conducted Andrew to the situation he now enjoys: he is independent and easy. Triumph and military honours do not always imply those two blessings. He is unencumbered with debts, services, rents, or any other dues; the successes of a campaign, the laurels of war, must be purchased at the dearest rate, which makes every cool reflecting citizen to tremble and shudder. By the literal account hereunto annexed, you will easily be made acquainted with the happy effects which constantly flow, in this country, from sobriety and industry, when united with good land and freedom.

And keep the grass low when the snakes slither
Grave dig ya a hole and let your homies lay with ya
Paint thinner the track and wipe the sleigh clean

""Is this happening to me""

Problems that won't shift
It's hard to admit that we are afraid
When we're hit in the head with
Unanswered questions that repeat
""How could I ever live after this day?""

We can take the hits and grow tougher
Collect ourselves to live longer
And find there is no need to be afraid

And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Bridge]
One day maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day she'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking, she'll call him mine
One day he'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet face to face
One day he'll look into her eyes
And say that, ""You're my only light""

[Chorus]
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I understand that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside",Tate McRae,1961,"[94, 53, 60, 77, 90]",5

You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all

388,Nature Boy,"There was a boy
A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far, over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
While we spoke of many things
Fools and Kings
This he said to me:

""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

389,Hello Walls,"[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Is anybody listening?
It's like I'm yelling, but I'm whispering
It's like it doesn't even matter
(I'm talking fast), but it's idle chatter
If you can feel me, hear me out
I got something to talk about
I promise I won't waste your time
Nevermind, I'm lying

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Hello walls, hello ceiling
No one's home, and I'm feeling
All alone
Hello bed, hello pillow
When I'm high, I still feel low
No one knows me like my things
But no one answers when I scream:
""Hello walls!""

(And I keep feeling invisible)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Laying in this bed I fear
Me filling my brain with some leads right near
I think if I do this my head I clear
Or maybe I should overdose on these meds right here?
Everytime I get ahead a wall hits me, fall quick
Do y'all history, when it came to my artistry it was all iffy
The laws just be raw, this we call shifty
Tall chips to fix me, ball, stalled, it be all thrifty
I don't let nobody see my pain behind these walls
Bet this blade will help me see my veins
Cause these walls are caving in and the ceiling's getting closer to me
Everybody is unhappy with me and taking away all dough's a doozy
I feel so, helpless and nervous that I will go ill
So freaking real though and spill slow
Caribou Coffee tryna stop my 'Bou Lou mill
So my grill show daily, but nightly tears upon my pillow
Right now I'm real low
So..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
My life looks like a party that never ends
I can't tell what's business and what's friends
I think they pretend to like me
And then I'm slightly get thrown off my look now
Why they phone of the hook, huh?
It's getting harder, to make it through the weekend
I try to push it farther, they act like I ain't speaking
I walk to the door, there's no one else to walk to
I talk to the wall, there's no one else to talk to

391,Watch Your Step,"[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
My guns are bigger than a baby's arm
With Agent Orange like I was raised in ‘Nam
The bullets stay inside your brain like it's your favorite song
I don't give a fuck who they hitting, they can graze your mom
I load the motherfucking clip in, they like baby bombs
I see it as something beautiful when the metal fly
Around the way call me Lucifer, a hell of a guy
I'm a motherfucking veteran I'm telling you why
Beat his head until there's red in them I'm letting 'em die
City of brotherly thugs, the home of filthy living
You ain't fucking around with Vinnie, Percee, and Guilty Simpson
Unless you wanna be the target that we dump the clip in
I do the shit during the day, I like the gun to glisten
You a backwards motherfucker you run prison
You think that being locked with males in jail's a fun position
You should kill yourself rapper and be stuck in the earth
To be honest ain't no rapper that can fuck with you, Perc

[Hook]
For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept
In the waistline where the roscoe's kept
I'm on the edge nigga watch yo' step
I'm on the edge nigga watch your step
We here to eat till there's no food left
In the waistline where the roscoe's kept
I'm on the edge nigga watch yo' step

[Verse 2: Percee P]
Fast or slow pace my flow lace tracks this cat'll throw bass
And don't waste steps and go chase broads to no place
Master streets, impress the freaks, pimps dressed for weeks
Hoes left to me I guess to cheat and test the sheets
Ripping shows from here to Britain yo I'm hitting hoes
Skipping those women that sniffin' blow and not getting dough
First degree murder rhymes disturbing mind like urban lies
And quote words only science to Percee P
Amateurs know they can't stand with the pro
My Los Angeles flow cause damages most scandalous foes better handle it yo
I'm getting that food that are steady ripping blacks
Spitting raps, hitting cats for kicking wack lyrics to bitten tracks
My interviews say I said a few lines to diminish crews
Some men'll do shit like bending rules
Go for the kill I'll still finish you
I'm so hot we gotta close shop, you know not to open your spot
While I patrol blocks you getting no props

[Hook]
For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept
In the waistline where the roscoe's kept

In the waistline where the roscoe's kept
I'm on the edge nigga watch yo' step

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Guilty Simpson damage is beyond word descriptions
Rough verse inscriptions wrote by cutthroats
Smoke in the alley where the young cats bust toast
Pinching pennies to pay up his truck note
My various techniques compare with Jet Li
I'll chop with an AK and kick when it's pay day
Let's see how many men must test me
Deadly with a pen, let the rest beware
Face down in the playground six feet deep
In the sandbox when my right hand cocks back on the hammer
You rest in peace
I pray on wack cats when I bless the beats
Like priests in the Vatican heat rat-a-tattling
And sprayed up the vehicle your homeboy traveled in
Fuck the spots they brag about
We kick your front door way in and drag em out",Percee P,1961,"[70, 51, 56, 65, 77, 92]",6

The tears filling the question of why

I don't want you to disappear
A memory forgotten in blackened stains

I don't want you to end, I don't want you to end
I don't want you to end, I don't want you to end
I don't want you to end, I don't want you to end
I don't want you to end, I don't want you to end

A flash of warmth across their names
It fades as quickly as it came
Black circles and grey skin
Impossible to feel warmth once again

No more blue tomorrows
Come and gone were your sorrows

I'm sorry it ended like this
I'm sorry it ended like this

404,Point Of No Return,"[Intro]
Yeah, it's that real this time around
Immortal Technique, Revolutionary Vol. 2
It's on now, motherfucker, lock and load!

[Verse 1]
This is the point of no return, I could never go back
Life without parole, up state, shackled and trapped
Livin' in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no comin' back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the Spanish exterminatin' Tainos
Rapin' the black and Indian women, creatin' Latinos
Motherfuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred
And now you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection, strapped down, ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace?
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle pitch fork and machete
The end of the world, motherfucker, you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changin' the Earth
They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you misusin' them, nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem, nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's temple
Al-Aqsa, the name is not coincidental
I know too much, the government is tryin' to murder me
No comin' back, like cuttin' your wrists open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country?
Genetic engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog rippin' off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm not comin' back

[Hook]
This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now, then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore

[Verse 2]
This is the point of no return, nigga, you better believe this
Mary Magdalene givin' birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killin' monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine-gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians: criminal-minded
Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it
Southpaw, murderous methodology, nigga
Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me, nigga
'Cause once you past the point, you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dyin' alone
So tell me, motherfucker, how could you die for the throne
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own?
It rains acid, one day the Earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world, livin' inside of a dome
Computerized humanity livin' inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is livin' and real
Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
'Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie

[Hook]
This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now, then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore",Immortal Technique,1961,"[85, 89, 91, 93]",4
405,I Feel So Bad,"[Verse]
I feel so bad
That I might have led you wrong

Thought they’d go back to how they were
Should’ve been honest sooner

""The beast lives out of the raging storm in the dead of night

Only the satisfaction of slaughter will cause it to return to
The darkness from which it came""

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Boys and girls, it's nighty night time
Happy J the Clown has a nursery rhyme
It's about The Boogie Woogie Man
Keep your light on as long as you can
Cuz when it cuts off, so does your head
Boogie Woogie Woogie waits under your bed
With a shank, splah!, up through the bottom
Little Jimmy Jimmy?

He creeps, he hides, he sneaks, he slides
If your little feetsies are hanging off the edge of the bed
You're running on stumps motherfucker!!!""

Well, moonlight fills the room that you sleep in
Things go bump in the night, me creepin
Ouch! Fuck! I stubbed my toe
If you'd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor
Fuck it, you're dead anyway
And I'm gonna leave your head smack dead in the hallway
In the morning, when your daddy walks out
AAAAHHH!!! His foots in your mouth, thanks to the Boogie Man

""Does the Boogie Man really exist?""
Well, is your mother a bald-headed freak bitch? (yes)
You fall asleep and you wake up dead
With a broken broom sticking out your forehead
I sing lullabies until you doze off
Tie you down and chew your fuckin toes off
And then spit em out back in your face
(spits) Fuck! Wash your feet, bitch!

""The world's famous Boogie Woogie Wu will come to you
Slumber parties, sleepovers, intimate nights
What the occasion for the midnight hour
He will gladly come and fuck that shit up""

[Verse 4: Violent J]
I don't beat woman, fuck that, I'm above it (no no)
But I'll cut her fucking neck and think nothing of it
""You didn't know the Boogie Man was a clown
But when you see the Juggla, your holding your jugular""

You're holding your neck together, but your nuts drop

They pull the axe out your face and say
""Was it the Boogie Man?""

Cuz the Boogie Man will creep
Through my window in my room
Stab me with a broken broom
Please don't let me fall sleep
Cuz the Boogie Man will creep
Through my window in my room

""It's the incredible, undeadable Boogie Man
Go ahead, pull the covers over your head
Hide under them, he don't give a fuck
It'll just make it that much more easier
For him to suffocate your face!""

There's three ways to stop me from doing what I do
What? You think Imma tell you?
""Mom, can you leave the door open a bit?""
Thanks, an easy way in, you fucking idiot
Now I stretch your neck out and play in like a banjo
Boomchicka boomchicka like that shit, yo?
Then I stretch it out more and fling your head through the wall

Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, often I'm caught up in confusion, in need of dissolution
They tell me the solution to see through this illusion I'm living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mamas tried to warn us, but few tend to listen
See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gena face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
That's the reason why my niggas can't find me, good golly
Look, shawty, ain't no need for games
I know a nigga still young, but I don' seen some things
If it's cool to talk, let me ease your pain
This is food for thought, let me feed your brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?
When them losers talk, tell 'em ""please refrain.""
I refuse to stop, don't freeze the frame
Cause tonight, I got you calling out Jesus name, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Often I'm caught up in confusion in tryna find solutions
To try and pimp the system that's a form of prostitution, I'm ready
The city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
Singing the Devil's song in a repetitive medley, I know
But shorty fire and she admire that I'm a pyro
Maniac, I said ""Where you at, and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best.""
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then ""ding ding,"" the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard
I'm starting off with that Cuevo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the Dagos
We like to fuck and watch the day go by
Hasta luego, drop the potato
She's hot, what can I say, yo?

[Hook: J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, JaVonte]
Left side, left side, hey

Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

413,A Scottish Soldier (Green Hills of Tyrol),"There was a soldier
A Scottish soldier
Who wandered far away
And soldiered far away

There was none bolder
With good broad shoulder
He's fought in many a fray
And fought and won

He's seen the glory
He told the story
Of battles glorious
And deeds victorious

But now he's sighing
His heart is crying
To leave those
Green hills of Tyrol

[Chorus:]
Because these green hills
Are not Highland hills
Or the island hills
They're not my land's hills
And fair as these
Green foreign hills may be
They are not the hills of home

And now this soldier
This Scottish soldier
Who wandered far away
And soldiered far away

Sees leaves are falling
And death is calling
And he will fade away
In that far land

He's called his piper
His trusty piper
And bade him sound alay
A pi-broch sad to play

Upon a hillside
A Scottish hillside
Not on these
Green hills of Tyrol

[Repeat Chorus]
And now this soldier
This Scottish soldier
Will wander far no more
And soldier far no more

And on a hillside
A Scottish hillside
You'll see a piper
Play his soldier home

He's told the story
Of battles glorious
And deeds victorious

The bugles cease now
He is at peace now

You've been around so long, you must be strong
And single life really has its fine points
Like friends to help you out when things go wrong

Hold back the tears that you've been crying
Push off the fears when they come around
Hold back the tears and keep on trying
Just around the next corner may be waiting your true love

Two lying fools and then four crying eyes
Counting on one another to survive
Crazy love must surely have this pain
If getting up means going down again

Hold back the tears that you've been crying
Push off the fears when they come around
Hold back the tears and keep on trying
Just around the next corner may be waiting your true love

Hold back the tears that you've been crying
Push off the fears when they come around
Hold back the tears and keep on trying
Just around the next corner may be waiting your true love

Hold back the tears that you've been crying
Push off the fears when they come around
Hold back the tears and keep on trying

Cause reality's fading
(Daydreaming)
So I sit here and daydream

[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Nightmares & dreamscapes
Sylvia invented that word, she's my dream date
She'd leave me keepsakes
And asked me if I'd keep her safe, I found a way
Now I'm out of place, high without a trace
I'm in outer space, a downward spiral state
...A sequoia in a flower vase
Roots reaching like a mile away
Either way, I don't wait
Lie Awake, eyes are weights
Visions of a smiling face
Imprinted on a prism with his dying traits
I'll close my eyes I can fly today
So high I can stay, away from everybody
Away from all the mirrors, safe from any judgement
They don't want me here, maybe heaven loves me
The night-terrors make me daydream
And lately it's the same thing

[Hook: JMSN]
(Daydreaming)
Cause reality's fading
(Daydreaming)
So I sit here and daydream

[Verse 2: Sadistik]
I don't need my head, the body it's connected with
The world that surrounds or the god that neglected it
Credulence that I lost with my temperament
Tempers get flared when they're impaired
In pairs when I exited an exodus
From excellence deafened by the deficit
I care but it's effortless
I get electric in my chair when it's mentioned like when Edison killed that elephant
Yea, Evil Eve got me to eat a apple core
I tried to drown my sorrows but they swam to shore
I feel so fragile for a second when I astral soar
Above The Matterhorn & Capricorn
I walk the line like a matador
On borrowed time that I can't afford
That's a category type that I can't ignore
The night-terrors make me daydream
And lately it's the same thing

[Outro: JMSN]
I'm daydreaming
What I think I can do
I'm daydreaming, yeah
I'm daydreaming, yeah

It's bedtime on Fed time it's lights-out and you're done
So lay it down, no mouth
Can hear you well, first time felon Tyrone
Was shouting until the door opened
Mess with Calhoun if you want
Pull up the covers, turn over like alligators, you're caught
I hear another remark, Take off my belt, no more talk
I tried being nice, nerves shot like
Hit in the back, I pop you two
Now go to sleep in the dark

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Entity]
I speak your dream probably cause my words are laced
With barbiturates, sleep now I start to replace
Everything you know no longer staying awake
So dream a little dream for a couple of days
Envision all my words and listen to my voice
And visualize what I've written cause you don't have a choice
You're hypnotized to the rhythm cause it strikes with a force
To paralyze so relax and just follow my voice

A breath of fresh air, my ear, nose, and throat is clear
I feel like my angels is near
Cooler than the northern hemisphere
No stress, no fear, the sky is clear
I'm in my underwear
Plenty of shade, nice babe, glass of lemonade
I'm paid am I dreaming?
For a better life I'm fiending
What's a meaningful life?
If you don't know yourself you'll never know
So I grab a dream, grab a pillow
Off to sleep I'll go, Tonight

417,I'll Never Be Free,"Each time I hold somebody new
My arms go cold thinking of you
No one can take your place, darling, in my embrace
I'll never be free

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss can put out the fire
Though I may try and try, no one can satisfy
This longing in me

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes

I cannot be free when I remember
How you fill me with desire
Just like a train tracks through my heart
Your love remains while we're apart
That kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free

That kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free",Van Morrison,1961,"[94, 96, 100]",3
418,Broken Hearted,"[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

[Bridge]
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

423,Mama Said,"[Chorus]
When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

[Verse 1]
Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never travelled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

[Chorus]
When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

[Verse 2]
Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don’t think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I'd be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids, they started bugging me
But now they're all standing right in front of me

When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright

I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I’m in doubt and struggling
That’s where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That’s why I always keep them tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?

My mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright

432,Jimmy Martinez,"The story began in Renosa
A village in old Mexico
A girl and a Mexican soldier
Were sweethearts, a long time ago
They made big plans for a wedding
The town of Renosa would go
And there would see Jimmy Martinez
Married to Sarah Sero
Oh-oh-oh

One day there came a message
It said that Jimmy must go
As Jimmy was leavin' Renosa
To fight at the Alamo
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh

Jimmy's last letter to Sarah
Began with a message like this
Oh dear one, how sweet is the memory
The memory of our parting kiss
I send my heart in this letter
I pray to the one up above
Oh Sarah, don't ever forget me
Stay just as pure as the dove
Oh-oh-oh

I'm like the dove in your window
It's chosen just one mate for life
And you are the one I have chosen
The one that I want for my wife
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh

Sarah refused to believe them
She prayed for Jimmy's return
And there ever night in her window
A small little candle would burn
Years turned her dark hair to silver
She prayed for Jimmy so long
Then one night the village was saddened
The light in her window was gone

Oh, can't she be a little straight?

Looking right through me like I wasn't there
Could've bowled me over when I realized
She was cooking me breakfast what a surprise

What a surprise baby, oh what a night
Looking real good, she was moving just right
I can't begin to describe all the charms
I held in my arms what a surprise

OOHH, OOHH, she didn't say nothing, not a word
OOHH, OOHH, I knew she was telling me something
Had to go back for a second helping

Out of the blue and right into my heart

In a lonely shack by a rail-road track
He spent his younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made me a slave to his wandering ways

He vowed we'd never part
Though he tried his best to settle down
Now I'm alone with a broken heart

And then that elevator starts it's slide
Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide
I should stay away but what can I do

I hear your name, and I'm aflame
A flame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
'cause you're the lover I have waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

443,How Many Tears,"A lot of things occur each day
We've got to live with on our way
There's so much misery on the screen
With commercials in between

And the Russians won't be so late
Uncle Sam don't wanna wait
No matter if you're black or white
You never ever had a right

And look up to the eternal skies
See warfare even there
What once has been a paradise
Now destruction and despair

In other worlds the children die
Lacking food ill from a fly
Oppressed by troops to tame their land
It's all the same again

If any man is free on earth
Then tormentors steal his birth
They slam gun butts in his face
And leave his woman choked in mace

So stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise you voice pass on the light
Unite! it's not too late

How many tears flow away
To become a sea of fears
How many hearts are torn apart
Till another torment starts

But before the world
Turns into a sun
All cruelty and violence
On earth will be dead and gone

So stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise you voice pass on the light
Unite! It's not too late

To become a sea of fears
How many hearts are torn apart

Spicy chicken sandwich, some burgers and French fries

Tell em bring the liquor, some mixers, and high heels
I'm half naked and all these ladies is as well
And you would be if you burn like we burnin', I'm hot as hell

Laissez-vous faire, Milord
Et prenez bien vos aises
Vos peines sur mon coeur
Et vos pieds sur une chaise
Je vous connais, Milord
Vous ne m'avez jamais vue
Je ne suis qu'une fille du port
Qu'une ombre de la rue...

Pourtant je vous ai frôlé
Quand vous passiez hier
Vous n'étiez pas peu fier
Dame! Le ciel vous comblait:
Votre foulard de soie
Flottant sur vos épaules
Vous aviez le beau rôle
On aurait dit le roi...
Vous marchiez en vainqueur
Au bras d'une demoiselle
Mon Dieu!... Qu'elle était belle...
J'en ai froid dans le coeur...

Allez, venez, Milord!
Vous asseoir à ma table;
Il fait si froid, dehors
Ici c'est confortable
Laissez-vous faire, Milord
Et prenez bien vos aises
Vos peines sur mon coeur
Et vos pieds sur une chaise
Je vous connais, Milord
Vous ne m'avez jamais vue
Je ne suis qu'une fille du port
Qu'une ombre de la rue...

Dire qu'il suffit parfois
Qu'il y ait un navire
Pour que tout se déchire
Quand le navire s'en va...
Il emmenait avec lui
La douce aux yeux si tendres
Qui n'a pas su comprendre
Qu'elle brisait votre vie
L'amour, ça fait pleurer
Comme quoi l'existence
Ça vous donne toutes les chances
Pour les reprendre après...

Allez, venez, Milord!
Vous avez l'air d'un môme!
Laissez-vous faire, Milord
Venez dans mon royaume:
Je soigne les remords
Je chante la romance
Je chante les milords
Qui n'ont pas eu de chance!
Regardez-moi, Milord
Vous ne m'avez jamais vue...
...Mais vous pleurez, Milord?
Ça je l'aurais jamais cru!

Eh bien, voyons, Milord!
Souriez-moi, Milord!
...Mieux que ça! Un petit effort...
Voilà, c'est ça!
Allez, riez, Milord!
Allez, chantez, Milord!
La-la-la...

Mais oui, dansez, Milord!
La-la-la...
Bravo Milord!
La-la-la...
Encore Milord!

456,Summertime,"[Intro]
Drums Please!

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

458,Lonesome Whistle Blues,"I was riding number 9
Heading south from Carolina
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow
Got in trouble, had to roam
Left my girl, left my home
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my baby's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off that Georgia Main
And locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow

All I do is sit and cry
As the evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my head turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that girl of mine
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my head turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that girl of mine

459,(I've Got) Spring Fever,"Well I walk in a cold reality
But I live inside a dream
Moderation never works for me
I take things to extremes
The only way I know to go
Is take it way too far
But I never speak a killer's name
Unless he plays guitar

I've got everything I'll ever need
Nothin' left at all
I've got warm winds in winter
Spring fever in the fall
Summer lightning in a bottle
I keep snowflakes in a jar
But I never speak a killer's name
Unless he plays guitar
I said
But I never speak a killer's name
Unless he plays guitar

Well I don't believe in magic
And I see it every day
You can travel all around the world
And never get away
You can stand here right like this
And fly beyond the stars
But I never speak a killer's name
Unless he plays guitar
I said
But I never speak a killer's name
Unless he plays guitar
I said
But I never speak a killer's name
Unless he plays guitar",Kim Mitchell,1961,"[93, 71, 73, 74, 78]",5

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns

Ahora estamos abrumados

Que tus sueños rigen tus días
Que lo perdido te encuentre
Que tu hablar sea una melodía, que de tus sombras no te lamentes

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Said without you girl ahh
Listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Oh yeah that without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything
And everything
To hear you say
That you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

He knows his time, his time has come

Verbal couture
Parkour
With the metaphors
The flow house of horror
Dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch
Six sense
With a nose drip
Mind skydive
Sniffing bumps
In the cockpit
Locksmith of Hip Hop
Appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size
As the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic
Prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends
Cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke
Just to sniff need a ski lift
Flip your table over
If you cut it with the bullshit
Nose bleeds red carpets
But it just blend in
Snapping pictures
Feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life
Seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left
So I try to seize the moment

Take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket
Savage with bad habits
Broke serving fiends
Got rich became a addict

Nose running right now
Could ya pass me a napkin
Managed to somehow
To have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone
And nobody is answering
Ain’t it funny how it happens

Ain't it funny how it happens
No way to mask it
A lot became has beens
Rolling up that 100 dollar bill
Till they cash in

Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down
Cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can’t stop laughing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can't stop laughing
It’s a living nightmare
That most of us might share
Inherited in our blood
It's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use
Or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to
Tell you what I’m gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems
With this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me
So popping them Xannies
Might need rehab
But to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y’all
Cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8 ball of coke
And my nigga on the way
Got 3 hoes with him
And they all tryna play

479,On The Rebound,"[Verse 1]
From the tantrum of teapots & coffee spoons
To the sigh when you turn out your bed light
From the wound in the side to the day a loved one dies
You know there is nothing you can do to make it right
So you don't call - as you fall
With closed eyes - further behind
And it responds, in a way, to the things that you say
At the dying of the day
(Don’t take your life for granted)

[Chorus]
Open up and lift those pennies from my eyes
I'm on the rebound, the same as you
Open up from your traditional disguise
I'm on the rebound, the same as you
From the badly chosen path to the tears when you laugh
From your yesterdays to all of your tomorrows
From the chains that you strap 'round yourself by the stone
To the song in a moment of sorrow
You take heed - from what you need
And blame it all - on tradition
It responds, in a way, to the things that you say
At the dying of the day

[Chorus]
I'm on the rebound
From tradition",Venerea,1961,"[63, 23, 17, 10, 10, 5, 4, 5, 7, 11, 15, 24, 51]",13
480,The Touchables In Brooklyn,"Brooklyn, New York, July 4th, 1939 - A day for fireworks
Murder Incorporated received a contract to rub out Elliott Fress
Stuttering Sam Goldman gave the order:

[From 'Blue Moon' by The Marcels]
Bomp-a-bomp-bomp....
Dang-a-dang.....

The job was given to Babyface Latka, notorious East New York trigger man
As Fress stepped from his headquarters.....[machine gun fire]
His gun still smoking, Babyface called
Stuttering Sam and gave his report:

[From 'Baby Sittin' Boogie' by Buzz Clifford]
Boogie, boogie, boogie, all night

Hearing the good news, Stuttering Sam rewarded
Him with Gangland's highest tribute:

[From 'Baby Blue' by The Echoes]
You're my baby blue

But Elliott Fress was still alive
Murder Incorporated took care of Babyface
New York police found his body buried in:

[From 'A Hundred Pounds of Clay' by Gene McDaniels]
A hundred pounds of clay

The following day, Canary Cone, another killer
Disguised as a messenger, delivered a small package
To the home of Elliott Fress
As the door opened, Canary sang:

[From 'Dedicated To the One I Love' by The Shirelles]
This is dedicated to the one I love

[sound of explosion]

Realizing he was in the wrong house
The killer looked down at his victim and said:

[From 'Pony Time' by Chubby Checker]
It's Pony time, get up!

Taken into custody, Cone made a full confession
Armed with this evidence, the Touchables
Surrounded a Brooklyn warehouse
Headquarters of Murder Incorporated
Fress called to Stuttering Sam:

[From 'Surrender' by Elvis Presley]
Oh my darling, please surrender

From inside came the answer....[sound of machine gun fire]

After a brief gun battle, Stuttering Sam stumbled
From the building, screaming:

[From 'That's It-I Quit-I'm Movon' On' by Sam Cooke]
That's it. I Quit

Aftraid he might talk, the National Crime Syndicate
Sent two killers disguised as police to the hotel where
He was being held. Terrified he pleaded:

[From 'I Don't Want To Cry' by Chuck Jackson]
I don't want to cry

He cried but not for long.....[sound of machine gun fire]

Mortally wounded, Stuttering Sam fell from
A seventeenth story window. His final words were:

[From 'Blue Moon' by The Marcels]
Bomp-a-bomp-bomp.......
Dang-a-dang.....

This was the end of Murder Incorporated
Called to Washington for official ceremonies
The Touchables were asked what dangerous assignment
They would like next

What if I told you that it was all in vain?
Would it still hurt you?
Would you still feel the same?
Said its impossible, possible
So impossible

[Chorus]
But you're still waiting on the moment
Breath is bated
I wish I could hold you, I can't take it
Tell you all my secrets
I'm too faded
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Maybe I can tell you, maybe we can do this
Kisses on my forehead, we can fall into it
Love you like the rain, it falls much faster
Living in a piece of ever after
Forever after
Living in the piece of ever after
Ever after, ever after

[Verse 2]
If you will have me
I'll make you happy
Need someone to whom I can belong
Here's my confession
Saving it special
Hoped it would be you all along
All along
All along
All along

But you're still waiting on the moment
Breath is bated
I wish I could hold you, I can't take it
Tell you all my secrets

Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (igh!)

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?

492,Lullaby Of The Leaves,"Rustling of the leaves used to be my lullaby
In the sunny South when I was a tot so high
And now that I have grown
And myself alone

Cradle me where Southern skies
Can watch me with a million eyes
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

Cover me with heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
I'm hearing a song, a song thru the trees
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
That fine melody caressing the shore
Familiar to me, I've heard it before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, that's Southland

Don't I feel it in my soul
And don't I know I've reached my goal
Sing me to sleep

[Verse 1]
The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Here's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Bridge]
I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved

494,I Can't Do It By Myself,"I can't do it by myself
I can't do it by myself
I need somebody else to help me
I need willing arms to share
And a loving heart to care
I just can't do it by myself

I wanna know just what a heart is for
And all the thrills that someone's kiss can bring
I wanna know just what love has in store
I wanna know so many things

I can't do it by myself
I can't do it by myself
I need somebody else to help me
I need willing arms to share
And a loving heart to care
I just can't do it by myself

The many wonders I have read of love
Have made me long to know that feeling too
But I find lonelieness instead of love
And though I've done
All I can do

I can't do it by myself
I can't do it by myself
I need somebody else to help me
I need willing arms to share

495,I'm In The Mood For Love,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh, is it any wonder that
I'm in the mood for love

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We put our hearts together
Now we are one don't be afraid

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain, we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it and get with it
I'm in the mood for love",Sam Cooke,1961,"[88, 38, 47, 41, 51, 45, 53, 75, 92]",9
496,Our Love Is Here To Stay,"(Verse)
The more I read the papers
The less I comprehend
The world and all its capers
And how it all will end
Nothing seems to be lasting
But that isn't our affair
We've got something permanent
I mean in the way we care

(Chorus)
It's very clear
Our love is here
To stay ;
Not for a year
But ever and a day
The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go!
But, oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're
Going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
There're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",George Gershwin,1961,"[89, 93, 99]",3
497,A Cross Stands Alone,"There is love or there is fear
It's up to you which will appear
You ask for the truth to make yourself clear
But you are stronger
You are wiser
Than you ever realized that you could be

[Chorus:]
So don't worry baby, no you'll be alright
About a million angels surround you tonight
You can't escape them even if you try
You are protected
You stand in the light
In the light
There comes a time in every man's life
He walks the line across his own strife
He stands alone
He lives then he dies
But you are chosen
One of the lucky few
And you're headed towards the purpose that you'll do

[Chorus:]
So don't worry baby, no you'll be alright
About a million angels surround you tonight
You can't escape them even if you try
You are protected
You stand in the light

In the la la la la .la la la la la la light

498,Pick Me Up On Your Way Down,"You were mine for just awhile
Now you're putting on the style
And you've never once looked back
At your home across the track

You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When there glamour starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath your still the same

When you learn these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When there glamour starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You maybe their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down",Charlie Walker,1961,[91],1

I know I vowed to never do this again, but, uh
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at
Got something that you need to know
Be the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note
Yeah, yeah, listen baby

[Verse 1]
Let me start by saying that the way I feel for you has never once changed
And the games I played, mistakes I made leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got a problem, baby, I can't lie
'Cause lately, I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that it was wrong, but we (let it be)
And I know you never knew when you said I do
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Verse 2]
Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And that spotlight feel like the right light
When it's really just my fears and I still don't dry your tears
When I say, ""She ain't you and I really love you more""
And you say, ""If it's true, why you do it for?""
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Bridge]
What I feel, I don't even gotta write it
It's like poison in my body and there's no way to deny
That my heart is a time bomb with seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what I'm offering

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?

If you ain't 'bout money, then I don't mess with y'all
Y'all think I don't get girls, cause I ain't very tall
If she see my stacks, I bet you that she calls

I have four hundred cars
I have four hundred scars and four hundred guitars
I have four hundred houses
I have four hundred mouses and four hundred houses
Bet you I can dance better than you
I bet you you don't know two plus two
It's four! It's four!
Now go and shut the door
Cause nobody wants to see your face no more
I'm tough as nails
You're slower than a snail
I beat up every single person in jail
I dare you to try and punch me
My face is so hard you'll say, ""Ouch, you crunched me""
I fought two lions and won
And I don't even carry a gun
But I never run, but I never run
But I never r-r-r-r, but I never run
You know you know that

I am the baddest of them all
If you ain't 'bout money, then I don't mess with y'all
Y'all think I don't get girls, cause I ain't very tall

Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty

[Verse 1]
11 years old I was sitting on the block
Yeah, my family had a little so I hid it in my sock
Sold them pills like they was Skittles, yeah, I always made a lot
I was always dodging 12, putting work in off the clock
Almost got cuffed, it was too much, it was a lot of drama
It was the streets that raising me, had to be dad and mama
I was young, head strong, wasn't letting up
Disrespectful my demeanor, didn't know who to trust

[Pre-Hook]
Now my mama straight, I ain't gotta push no weight
I came from the dirt, now I'm living great
Said I won't gone make it, look how hard they hated
Never had enough and now the bank, we break it

Who will love you true, true, true

Save her love and kisses just for you
Save her love and kisses just for you

The very first time I fell in love
Got my heart broken then
People would say when I passed their way
""There's a hot young man going there, going there
An unhappy lad going there""

Well one day my mother called me to her side, said
""Son, why you so blue?""
Mother, I lost the girl that I love
Why won't you tell me what to do?
Mother, won't you tell me what to do?

Well, she said
Find yourself another girl
Who will love you true, true, true
Find yourself another girl
Save her love and kisses just for you
Save her love and kisses just for you

I can imagine how you feel, my son
But throw it out of your mind
I'm going to tell you kind of truthfully
True love is hard to find sometimes
It's kinda hard to find

But forget about that girl that broke your heart
And try and start anew
For if there was a guy for her
There's got to be a girl somewhere for you
Got to be a girl somewhere for you

You just go on and
Find yourself another girl
Who will love you true, true, true
Find yourself another girl
Save all her love and kisses just for you
Save all her love for nobody but you

Ooh, another love
Ooh, another love
Ooh, another love
Save her love and kissses just for you

Oh when it rains it always pours
But I have found a friend in Noah
Still the dogs they bite and it's cold at night
And the sharks deep in the water
There's more of us than ever
But we're just lonely altogether
So baby, reach out and remind me that it's real

[Chorus]
I need you to love me tenderly
I need you to touch me gentle, please
'Cause it's cold out there
It's tough enough
So baby, love me tenderly

[Verse 2]
Oh it's a rollercoaster ride
We all need someone to hold onto
A friend who understands exactly what we must be going through
If you can trust a stranger
The go and reach out, touch your neighbour
And do your best to let them know they're not alone

[Chorus]
Why don't you just love me tenderly?
Why don't you just touch me gentle? Please
'Cause it's cold out there
And they like to play rough
So baby, love me tenderly

[Bridge]
Oh please, just close the door behind you, dear
Oh don't you let the cold inside of here
No I don't wanna talk about it
Heard just quite enough about it
Baby, won't you take me outta here?

[Chorus]
Come on and love me tenderly
How about you touch me gentle, please
'Cause it's cold out there
It's tough enough
So baby, love me tenderly
Why don't you just love me tenderly?
Love me gentle, please
'Cause it's cold out there
And they like to play rough
So baby, love me tenderly

I whittled out a fiddle from my wagon seat
I fiddled my fiddle and I rubbed my bow
Play a little tune wherever I go

Sleepy-eyed John, you better your britches on
Sleepy-eyed John, better tie your shoe
Sleepy-eyed John, you better get your britches on
And try to get to heaven 'fore the Devil gets to you

Well, Sleepy-eyed John he stole a goose
The goose he flopped but he couldn't get loose
Said John to the goose ""If you don't be still
We'll miss my supper down in Candyville.""

Well Sleepy-eyed John he had a wooden leg
The little leg was nothing but a little wooden peg
One shoe off and one shoe on
He'll do the double shuffle 'til the cows come home

Now I got twenty dollars for to build a fence
I took my money and I ain't worked since
Sold my buggy and I sold my plow
I wouldn't take a dollar for my journey now

Well over the hickory and down the pine
The raccoon laughed and the old hound whined

518,A Dollar Down,"Throughout history mankind has been plagued with triangles
A there's the eternal triangle
The isosceles triangle
And the schrons flippus (That’s the one! Yeah)

However this song is about a friend of mine
Who bought an automobile
Dollar down and a dollar a week
And everytime he turned the wheel
Dollar down and a dollar a week
He got a credit card for that new machine
Dollar down and a dollar a week
And he kept it full of gasoline
Dollar down and a dollar a week

Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down and a dollar a week

Well he went speeding on down the road
And kissing his gal upon her cheek
They took him to jail but he put up bail
Dollar down and a dollar a week
The judge did fine him fifty bucks
And asked if he would like to speak
He said, 'Judge if I may, I'd like to pay’
Dollar down and a dollar a week

Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down and a dollar a week

When he got out, he married that gal
Dollar down and a dollar a week
He bought a wedding ring that was pretty cheap
Dollar down and a dollar a week
Refridgerator and a washing machine
Dollar down and a dollar a week
And the food stayed cold and the clothes stayed clean
Dollar down and a dollar a week

Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down and a dollar a week

They got themselves a little home
Dollar down and a dollar a week
With a second mortgage and a pretty good loan
Dollar down and a dollar a week
He said to his wife, 'It's a pretty good life'
Dollar down and a dollar a week
And she said, 'Honey we don't need much money'
Dollar down and a dollar a week

Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down and a dollar a week

But six little kids did soon arrive
Dollar down and a dollar a week
He had so many worries that he could not sleep
Dollar down and a dollar a week
As their debts began to mount
They added them up apon a sheet
They said with tears, 'We’ll take a thousand years at a’
Dollar down and a dollar a week

Just a dollar down and a dollar a week
You can get all the things you seek
For a dollar down
And a dollar a week",The Limeliters,1961,"[69, 60, 73]",3

Talking them up about the things they do so well

il dolore che avanza

nella notte mentre spero
cerco ancora di sognare

il dolore è più lieve
anche se il passo è ancora breve

I'm 'bout to lose patience
Said this in the basement

So much fake shit ever since I made it
I won't ever be quiet cause I'm famous
Y'all gon' hate this (yeah, yeah)

This ain't no average Joe shit, this is everyday Russell
Joe got a day job, that's an everyday struggle
This for all the slow rappers who subliminally diss
You can at it, you can text it but you'd rather be bitch
But it's hard to hear the hate over these waves crashing
I think your time is up, I think your waves crashing
All that fade catching you promoting shit is all talk
The difference is my life is still lit when I log off, pussy go head

Fuck these fake alliances
I don't be buying shit, it's not in my interest
You be window shopping, I be buying it
I'm fly as shit

If you lucky I might make a song and diss you again
And when I say you, I meant you too
They call me Bono

Rappers feeling jumpy
Then bounce pussy, pogo

This for rappers who need other rappers hooks to go bronze
This for rappers who need other rappers shows to go on

These for rappers who still suck still
Six years later you still stuck still
Still on the uphill
There's some rappers who won't be here by the next June
There's some rappers who still asking for some leg room

I kick back and watch these losers go and kill themselves

And call Calicoe over like, ""Rip the tags off.""
You the 4th dirtiest nigga in battling, {points to Calicoe}
You 3rd
But got the nerve to tell niggas they swag off
And it's been 5 battles straight and you have yet to take that hat off
Now either Blind Fury is your barber, he zipped you and took the back off
Or you have a hairline that'll make Lebron happy but piss Smack off
You know what, fuck the jokes, I ain't got time for all the extra kidding
So I don't wanna hear how you been hard
Which one of y'all niggas got his SIM card?
Cause his texts/Tec's is missing, not mine
I got Mobs, throw that extra clip in
You'll get Roc'd cause I let my K-Shine without Rex permission
Aye Mook! He wanna be a Ruff Ryder
Y'all should let this bitch take Eve's spot
Knock his wig off, he'll get the same scalp Jada' and Styles P got
I show up in Detroit with a gun that's big enough to take Sheek's spot
So when it's shooting you better tell everybody in the D-Block
Before I kill you with more lines like that, it's some real shit I gotta address
X-Factor, the new old nigga, I'm sorry y'all but I'm not all that impressed
Cause in order to be a champion you gotta defeat a champion
Be ready to give and take a beat down
And under no circumstance do you get scared
And demand to go under three rounds
Smack and Beasley called your phone, am I lying?
And you was like, ""I mean, I mean, I mean
I'm not fearing shit, a fat bitch bungee cord snapped on Richie
So I'm not scared and shit
But it's just, it's Charlie Clips we're talking about
And I need a whole lot of time to prepare and shit.""
You bitch ass nigga, you gotta be ready to give and take that contact
Smack and Beasley should have a meeting and then jump you
Cause going 3 rounds was in our contract
But you begged to go one
And then you asked if I can only rap for five minutes
My reply, ""Five minutes? Suck my dick! I rap until I'm finished!""
They paid $100 per ticket, plus tax, everybody in here gotta be hating you
But this ain't the first time you did some sucka shit X
I been seen the fake in you
DNA said let's battle, you said ""no""
Then when 2 weeks left you said, ""I'm taking you.""
You made your 3 rounds, yeah, and you accepted the challenge
I see the snake in you
DNA only had two weeks to prepare
You had a whole month, he was flaming you
Cause you had to get the priorities theme
From Quest McCody to even make it debatable
You know how many niggas wanna battle me?
How many niggas dream of killing Clips?
I give you the fucking opportunity
And you ask for one round, you fucking idiot!
So for the fans that wanted you to kill me in three
And was hoping to see your stock rise
You subconsciously stabbed them in the back
And for that, you will never be top five
Now back to these bars...ain't you a reverend or some shit?
So what you know about throwing that chrome on styling?
Or your moms buying Idaho potatoes
But you using them to put your chrome on silent
No sound it's just...I let that chrome off smiling
Cause when it ring he'll get the Tec's/text but never know it, like his phone on silent
This is what you wanted nigga? You wanted me to be disrespectful
Put my dick in your niece fish tank, dump the water on your nephew
I Tsu Surf lock pick the door, like ""errrr"" show your family what that Tec do
Send 'em all in the sky for cheap, my hammer Jet Blue
Little message for you Detroit niggas that wanna get Clips
Scope on, one eye open, but it ain't Slick Rick
I don't wanna hear how y'all go in y'all Arsonal
To grab Shotgun's until they click click
Cause the only nigga that went to Arsonal for that Shotgun was Trick Trick
Arsonal and Shotgun would probably knock you the fuck out
So I don't wanna hear how you grip the Glock
You bird ass nigga
Since you a chicken I'd rather kill you using a chicken's pot
Like you better roll if you don't pay me, I throw that Idaho on that .380
Them shots steam, send you to Heaven with hot wings
Cause I mash potatoes for the gravy
We feeling on your chicken's breasts but you in love with that old whore
And you be snacking on her box but you don't know she a cold slaw
You ain't nothing but an old chicken that Smack threw in some new grease
Against a new beast that come with that biscuit, I'm like a two piece
If I catch you in that drop, I throw that biscuit to your top
You get your memory five
Since you riding like John F, it's only right I get Kennedy fried
You mentioning me in your blogs and your battles
It's like you can't go a day without me
So I called Ms. Cleo and she told me
""Every ting you plan to say about me.""
He gon' be like, ""I blame bloah again and soak him up like Shamwow again
And make him suffer, how you plan to get a deal? You fat motherfucker
You wore salmon pink against Ave Verb?"" but I'm still good in the gutter
See I'm a hustler
So I wore salmon to let you know I was good with the butter
He gon' be like, ""You ain't got no haircut in your blogs
How you expect to get your chicks wet?
We always see you in Harlem, but never see you with the Dipset
You got the image of a plumber
That's the only way you giving bitches pipe
And in ya battle with Verb you got more dislikes than likes.""
Now that's true, I do got more dislikes than likes, but that ain't shit to me
My 2nd battle, got paid more than you and 10 other niggas that night, I made history
You know how I'm that nigga?
Cause in your last two battles you had to mention me
You almost lost to Surf convincingly
So I made you battle DNA and Rich Dolarz just to get to me
Little nigga, how you expect to hold it down when you gon' correct me
And tell me how Street Fighter 1 ain't never had a bonus round?
It don't have a bonus round, see I be saucy when I say things
So if I fuck up a Street Fighter line
It must make you think that I play games
But if you do wanna play games, let's just make sure it's all action
A UFC type of game where it's kicking or all capping
We can throw the gloves on, play Fight Night with all jabbing
Cause if I throw a bullet you'll need a Raven's defense on All Madden
You might wanna hit Clips cause these offense lines get you mad as hell
But if I grip that hit stick, your helmet fly, you get a shit bag as well
If I bare/bear arms, you better turn Devon Hester running fast as hell
Or get this red circle in your head like Hines Ward in Madden 12
I am not a Game Boy
And you blacker than a PSP, you never seen cash
Your flow 16 bit, mine 32 that's why it seem fast
Catch 'em while he sleep, PlayStation 3 on the way that beam flash
Head shot, let his brains rest in his pillow, now that's a Dreamcast
I'm the controller, I leave squares like you so dead
So if X plan to try angles/triangles like Verb
He'll get an L 2/too and have to battle O-Red
Say it again? I said...
I'm the controller, I leave squares like you so dead
So if X plan to try angles/triangles like Verb
He'll get an L 2/too and have to battle O-Red
Speaking of my nigga O-Red, ""manama, malala, manamama
Mala malama, manamma, manama, malama, manamma
Mama, manamama!""
Now my niggas behind me is like ""What the fuck was my man saying?""
My bad it's only two niggas that can speak this language
I'ma hit y'all with my translation...I said
Lil' nigga you better get low as possible before I let that mag hit you
ICU, your monitor on but your shit showing mad scribble
Your soul leaving your body, cause that's what happens when a mag hit you
So you brain dead, don't even know you travelling
You Lebron when he crab dribble
Now I done murdered you bar for bar and exposed you
The crowd was applauding me nigga, but it's something I forgot to do
Not the translation, I did the Lebron shit, now I remember
I gotta address your priorities, nigga
Two weeks ago I put you in my top 5 and like that I was in disbelief
And had to take you right out of my top five
Cause I found out that he a fucking thief
Remember when he told DNA ""You basic
Get a face lift when that 8 spit
Cause it'll blast and put DNA in a bag like a rape kid""
Now at that time I was like ""Woooo!"" cause that line was certainly fresh
But I realized you stole that from Dizaster
Cause he said he told Swave Sevah
""I'll put DNA in a box like a paternity test""
DNA, paternity test, rape kid, we all watch Law & Order SVU
That shit is the same my nigga
So for you being black stealing punchlines from an Arab
That makes you a lame my nigga
Next time you wanna steal bars get some authority nigga
I'm not trying to be funny
I'm trying to help you with your...priorities, nigga!
Or how 'bout when he told Rich Dolarz, ""I run up in ya state property
Properly, you ain't hot as me cause when it flash
It'll put Rich Dolarz in a bag like a bank robbery,"" right?
Now when I heard that I was like, ""woooh!"" cause that line was crazy then
I realized you stole that from DNA cause he battled Rich and said
""My shotgun will take Dolarz out like an ATM""
Dolarz, ATM, bank robbery, we all seen Set It Off
That shit is the same my nigga
So for you being 40, stealing lines from a 20 year old
That just makes you a lame my nigga
The next time you wanna steal bars, just get some authority nigga
I'm not trying to be funny, I'm trying to help you with your priorities nigga
You fucking thief, you should end up dead in an alley like Raheem
Since you don't know how to keep it real
How do you ever expect to be Bishop if all you know a steal
Just cause a nigga bar cold don't mean you should go rap it
Just cause a nigga bar cold don't mean you should go and jack it/jacket
So the next time you wanna steal bars, just get some authority nigga
And I really freestyled those last 4 lines but I hoped they helped you with your priorities nigga
Now this priority right here is some real shit that I gotta address
I thought you was a great father, but the way you treat your son is a mess
Remember when you wrote on Twitter how you be getting drunk
And be getting saucy off the dark
And you got so drunk that you lost your little son in the park?
Or what about when you battled Amzilla
And you said how you crazy and something wrong
And how you'll punch your son in the face if he stare at you for too long
You look like you get drunk
Beat you son and then leave him with the neighbors
Since you whipping your son ass, I""m whipping my son ass
But doing your son ass a favor
So the next time I hear you fucking with him
Or you raise your hand to fucking hit him
I'ma take a flight to Detroit
Pistol whip you and have ACS come and get him
So the next time you wanna beat him
You call me to get the authority nigga
Cause he's not yours no more, now he's my priority nigga
I hope you got a whole new scheme when you go to battle me nigga
Cause the priority shit is worn out now, it's time for reality nigga
If you battled Nemesis when DNA had a tooth
Then that means that was awhile ago
You been under Miles and Marv Won for years
And out of nowhere came Calicoe, you trying to be top 5 in battling
You not even top three in your own city
If they redid Bad Boy in Detroit, he'll be Biggie you'll be an old Diddy
You had your chance to be Biggie, then Miles took on T-Rex
You lost to Nemesis then got demoted to G-Dep
That nigga Miles got destroyed by Loaded Lux
We all seen the expression on you and your boss face
So you did have your chance to be Biggie cause that night you lost Faith
So I hope you go to do you thing when you go battle me nigga
Cause if you lose tonight, JC will be over you by tomorrow
And that's reality nigga
You said Rich Dolarz got on a stanky Yankee
I can't believe this is the same cat
In two blogs and three battles I caught you wearing the same hat
Type in QP versus B Magic he got on a black and purple Coogi sweater
Looking aight, so I was like, ""Yo my nigga getting his change better.""
Then I typed in ""X-Factor Summer Madness recap""
And the dirty nigga had on the same sweater
Now for all my hustlers in the trap
Y'all know wearing the same clothes twice ain't no thing
But they zoomed in on his sneakers and his Air Max had no strings
You wore the same sneakers, the same hat and the same stanky Coogi
But I know you don't know no better
Smack, lend him $250, buy a metro card, go to 14th and Main
Tell 'em I sent you and put you in a Polo sweater
Go burn that fucking Coogi the next time you come and battle me nigga
Cause now they all know you dirty and that's reality nigga
I'm glad you talking to me while I'm rapping
So now I go this lil' tune that I'm hearing the same
About how you ate Shooney the Rapper's ass
From out of Queen Of The Ring
You know what's funny? That's not even a joke, that shit is real fact
You ate a bitch that got more bars than you, that shit is real wack
I'm a freak myself, but under no circumstance do I feel that
A man's tongue should hang in the same hood that [?] and Scott chill at
So I know you gon' click and spray
You probably got a rhyme for every different day
I mean you eat ass, I'm pretty sure you got some shit to say
I thought this nigga here
You know what I fucked up, I forgot my damn line
Sike! You must be out your damn mind!
What do I look like choking?
Tell this nigga that's not cool
Get in a battle and go, ""I fuck with the boy Surf"" nigga I am not you
So the next time you go choke when you battle me nigga
Bizarre will never co-sign you again and that's reality nigga
Now I want you to get on Twitter right, tell 'em how you killed me
Tell a lie to those folks
But you know what's gon' hurt you?
When they watch this whole battle
And realize I ain't ever crack a nose joke
Time, nigga! Sike! I lied nigga!
Listen', don't worry 'bout why I ain't do three
Why you keep talking while I'm rapping?
They wouldn't call you if they wanted to see they father rap
My bars is crazy I make Detroit niggas have heart attacks
Now I said sike, I lied nigga, your nose look like a field goal's good
That shit is ""this"" wide nigga
It look like you could take a deep breath and smell what's outside nigga
If ya nose is that big, how could you tell your niggas, ""Good looking?""
Hold on see y'all niggas keep talking while I'm rapping
In the hood I learned to slaughter this work
He the first nigga that go on Phat Farm Nautica shirt
Get Calicoe? I mean y'all told me that awhile ago
Math said you ate Ms. Hustle pussy on her period
Nah, I'm just joke, I'm just joking...I mean serious
Now I'm to the hood where my troops control the block
Cause I just fat bitch bungee cord
Cut that shit short I got a Superbowl to watch

[Round 1: X-Factor]
I swear I'ma put an end to this bitch
And he lied on 90% of that shit, and you know that right
Ya fags off swag sauce
You got a fat back, skinny legs with man breast that sag off
With no bitch so Charlie Clips gotta rub a stick to blast off
X-Factor versus DNA, shit, my bad, I mean Charlie Clips
But I already off DNA using Charlie clip
Since we all know DNA be on Charlie clip
I give you a different way of looking at it
See I run up on Charlie like, ""What's popping?"" Charlie Clip
Up that 4-5th and snatch that ratchet off of Charlie hip
Smack the shit out Charlie's lip, probably knock the tooth out him
He spit it out, now we see DNA in Charlie Clips
But that's only the half of it, now it's blood all over that ratchet
So again, you'll see DNA on Charlie Clip
I'm a motherfucking veteran, varsity, Letterman
He all talk, Letterman, Verb, who let him in?
I'm on every fucking top 5 list to every men
On a list with the veterans, all niggas you're not better than
Mook, Rex, Lux, Miles, Math, Solomon, all niggas that's ahead of him
Fat gut chump, I give a fuck cause NY rank him like he so live
You got 2 battles on camera, I had that in '05
Now add that there, imaginary deal with Cam'
Fam' what? Chuck Philly so major?
But you know me, fuck is you? I'm doing the favor
NYC all I ask is y'all give a nigga props
And if he say some shit that's hot and it's hot, then let it rock
But if he say some shit that's not hot and y'all gas it and give it props
The cameras never lie, so the fans gon' see it's not
Now I""m not battling Charlie Clips because I think this nigga nice
It's cause the fans got him hype and to me you just aight
But I had a talk with my conscience in public, fuck it
We was deep in, I'm reasoning with these mahfuckas
Cars riding by, beeping, but see the talk I had with my conscience
My conscience spoke a lil' knowledge
That reasonable me said he was nice
But the arrogant side said he was garbage
Reasonable me: ""X I ain't gon' lie, that boy Charlie Clips is nice
And if you take that nigga light, he'll probably put an end to your night
And you done came too far to be on top of this battle shit
To battle Clips and not let that whole 'matic clip spit at average Clips
I said, ""You right"" but before I could get a word out
The asshole tapped me and said, ""X can I please have my words now?""
He said, ""Man that nigga trash, that nigga butt, that nigga ass
He couldn't see you if you lived in a crib in Time Square and it was glass
You did legendary shit, killed DNA and bodied Rich
Priorities nigga, that's a hit, how many round he had? Six
And see three of which he battled a nigga that was sick
But Tay took a two year break so he swung back and he didn't hit
The other three in which he battled a nigga that had some shit
But Verb didn't just battle Clips
But like 3,000 fans that was riding this nigga's dick
I said, ""Shit, y'all both right, and take sides is kind of hard to
So I'll take advice from both and show niggas I'm impartial
I""ll give 'em bars like I'm 'bout to go 30 rounds with Marshall
But still feel you don't deserve these small bars that I've [?] you
Now bars I got 'em often, he been doing a lot of barking
He must be high so it's only right he's taking an L for talking
Jump in that 40 it's hearse day
Your trunk that's where your skirt and your purse stay
That .38 Special, a retard two years before his 40th birthday
Clips is on that walk of fame, putting in a lot of hard work
But be careful what you say out your mouth spitting them bars jerk
Cause if it's beef and my niggas peep you in that car first
They Dial us (Dallas) we come with them cal' boy (Cowboys)
For thinking we candy I'll leave that Star burst
I bet you 10 times outta 10 under your left titty stink
And since you've waken, you've eaten 5 guys about 5 times
Wendy's fries and a Big Mac
I'm off the hip, two cans when I blow
So if that's first one miss you
Your kids will die from the cig' off the 2nd hand smoke
Uh oh, I'm back on my shit again
Clips done took that bait like a fisherman
Reel 'em in, what's on my waist mean black can sing, Aunt Vivian
You see Uncle Phil, I'm Fresh and the Prince of Michigan
I told my killer Jeffrey I'll give you/U K's, now send him 10
Hit him from this waist to his neck
You button then I'll bend ya men (Benjamin)
You're not a man in my eyes, your vagina trying to play hard
When that 4 on me, no sorority but I'll cap a/Kappa
I'll ride through Harlem comfortable with them guys with me
Charlie's nowhere in sight unless the bakery's giving pies for free
But if you do see me, be easy giving that eye to me
Because 16 from that Charger will bust, no Ryan Leaf
I take the pound, run up on him, lay him down, face the ground
I figure he ain't built so why would I waste a round?
I say Conceited slow that down
I take the pound, run up on him, lay him down, face the ground
I figure he ain't built (belt) so why would I waste/waist a round/around
You a fat nigga bugging, who ain't seen below his waist since a kid
The first time he saw his toes he thought they was chicken nuggets
Fat nigga start spazzing, damn near had a heart attack
Cause he couldn't grab 'em
I got bars, I got jokes, my stage presence is a gift
I control that crowd beautifully
I planned your eulogy for the fifth
He tried to run and was open so I blew one through his shit
And told the judge, ""You aren't supposed to put bullets into clips""
Start a show and I'll get to clapping
Tonight it all ends, I'm 'bout to silence this nigga, Charlie Chaplin
Leave that whip smoking til it's rolling, it'll look like the Marley's passing
Run up on it, break the glass, clap half his back in
Til his lap catches his abdomen and that whip slip and hit, crash and bend
You the type to get mangled with them bars
Fuck around and wanna tangle (tango)
Well I'll send you Dancing With The Stars
In that court singing, get carried/Carey'd when that Cannon go off
Then I squirt until it earth, my seed planted in her jaws
I be going HAM, up dumping, squeezing that pump
Clips be going HAM, add bacon, cheese...
No remorse I'll even slump his lil' cunt
Let that fif' swisher, sheesh I had to be blunt
From what I heard you be begging bitches to get off in they vagina
But I also heard bitches is never on your tip cause it's tiny
Just ask your whore, she love when slam her raw
She told me when my Thing get rocked it's what I'm Fantastic 4/for
Fuck this battling shit, you'll think that chrome was his clone
The way I'll have Charlie battling Clips
I'm usually mild mannered but act in this damn place
I'll slap this man face til his jaw snap like blacks after a handshake
I won't even put the heater to him
Niggas start yapping to the coppers cause they'll be locked up
Before the choppers get to squeezing through him
Now I gotta skip town, a couple pounds I bet C'll do him
Cause soon as I touchdown TD, Jakes, he'll be preaching to 'em
I tried to listen to his album, Calicoe was like, ""Why fam'?""
I'ma keep it a buck and a half, it's trash, I ain't gon' lie fam'
I said, ""Fuck it"" I even tried to listen to it fried then
I played 2 and 5, damn near committed suicide
I couldn't feel/fill this high
I got that Shotty in, I'll let that Shotty spin
And let his wig hold the whole clip like a Bobby pen
My bottom bitch thick as a steak, boy stop that
You saucy cause your A1 bitch couldn't top that
I'm at my girls house watching battles
I said, ""Come here baby, this 'bout to be some shit.""
She said, ""Ohh, Fatman Scoop?!""
I said, ""No, that's Charlie Clips""
But anyway, that nigga there can spit
Halfway in his third against Aye Verb
That's when I witnessed some shit
Now it was on some gay shit but he said Verb be on some gay shit
And right after Verb say some gay shit, he licks his lips
Now that's when I seen some gay shit
But you said Verb lick his lips every time he say some gay shit
And right in the middle of you talking 'bout all that gayness
Charlie Clips turned around and licked his lips
As y'all see I'm getting bored with this nigga
But y'all know I wasn't gonna end it without addressing at least one of your priorities nigga
Against Tay Roc - 200, against Verb - about 305
Nigga, that's growth at a rapid rate
Easy on the cheeseburgers and chili cheese steaks
These your niggas right?
Y'all down to ride? Righter there letting that .380 fly
Who gon' be down to right with helping this mahfucka stay alive?
No that's real shit, I'm being honest, that' my word A
You got no kids, you're not married, I know you want that in your old age
But at the rate that you're going you'll probably die in your sleep by 38
High blood pressure by 31, diabetes by 33, congestive heart failure by 36
I'm saying you my mans and I'm just worried Clips
But you been in the gym, I can tell you trying to get back
Pull ups for your delts, couple dips for your las
I'm backing you 100%, that's all I gotta say scrap
But just remember just because you're ate fat you don't have to stay that
Now soon you gon' walk in that spot and see cones with the ice cream
Freshly baked German chocolate cake topped with the icing
Now for you that's probably high torture my nigga
But before you go make a slice and take a bite
Think life and how got to live a lot more of it my nigga
Now I'm not saying this to be funny
Or try to wipe the floor with this nigga
But I feel like this is real life and Clips it's priorities nigga
When that mac buck duck you lil' fat gut fuck
As y'all see I just spazzed on this nigga and y'all niggas know
I just fat bitch bungee cord snapped on this nigga",URLtv,1961,"[61, 50, 37, 43, 57, 61, 75]",7

529,(Theme from) My Three Sons,"[Intro]
We were sitting out on a step, you know

[Verse 1]
Now I'm a say this one time boy and that's my word
We rockin' shots and not fire through the Hindenburg
The contribution is clear
You add water to bone
And get the Jurassic 5 on the microphone
Now if you like the tone
And how the harmony's done
And the sucka MC's die before they've begun
Well I'd like to know if
You've got the notion
'Cause we're number one
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours
I'm just on some other shit
I'm all about the beats and the lyrics
So when you hear it you can feel it
The vibe is energized by the presence of my spirit
No interference we persevere
The purpose is clear
We're here to leave your ear hurtin' severe
You're lurking in fear
'Cause we take it back like Robin Loxley
Rockin' from country sides to spots where hard rocks be
I often wonder if these MC's even know how it feels
To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel
It's not about the bills
That's not keeping it real
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
'Cause it's the 100 watt bloodshot Game of Death
'Cause we're protected by the covenant of words and beats
Rewind and feel the heat
Recline and take a seat
So ah...

[Hook:]
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live mc's
Playground tactics
No rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic
Rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live mc's
Playground tactics
No rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic
Rap shit from Jurassic


[Verse 2]
Now I walk from Tanzania
Earthquake Transylvania
And on my way I kicked a hole through the wall of China
Just to get the right blend
'Cause it's schizophrenic of the pathway to livin'
I fell into the deep end
You shouldn't have told me
The pyramids can hold me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your beats pull out your cuts
Give us a mic, whattup
And we gon' tear shit up
I'm on some old and forgotten
Sun up to sun down
Like picking cotton
The nutty professor science droppin'
Rockin' Robin's hood
From New York to Compton
Me and my three sons
Jabari, Shakir, and Kahsum

Hey, I'm 2na-Fish from U-N-I-T-Y

Do the liquid from my vocals
Make the ghetto start swimming
Forever winning I'm in it

I get goosebumps
When the bassline thumps
A sucka MC freestyle
He had mine for lunch
Marc 7even get you open like an attache
Briefcase in this case
The victor is no way
Ah, ah the tool spinners
Cooking the full dinner
Killing the firstborn of lyrical Yul Brynners
When is it the academy
Rattling your anatomy
That'll be J5 so kill all of your fake flattery
That'll be the day
When labels pay our way
2na what you say
When MC's come to play
Man fi dead
'Cause we take it back like Spinal Tap
Preparing your intellect before your final nap

You got beef now watch how I settle it
I'll fuck around and arrest your whole development

From here to Brooklyn
Your shit's annoying like fat-ass Bookman
On Good Times
When I rhyme
I hit the designated area
I hope you got your shots 'cause this is lyrical malaria
Spreading, beheading fools with the punishment
I live in America but fuck this government
A hundred and fifty times over silk with lead
While y'all drink the Similac
My rhymes are breast-fed
No artificial nipples
I flip the real skills
I thought I told you once
I kick the lyrical windmills
And backspin Benedict

And I hope you say ""good buy"" when they ask was it worth for you to pay
For my music, for pressin' play
For all the stress that went into my songs
My love and hate
The most honest I could be with you to date
Is to say thank you Shady
For lettin' me be me with no holds bar'd
Thank you for the chance to enhance this old car
This old jar of moonshine is but two fine lines on a blank sheet but so far
These two lines point directly to my home on the mothership sonar
Valet UFOs, I go park
The dirty south needs a soap bar
In the mouth of these MCs but
But who am I to judge on what they love?
I guess they enjoy being broken co-stars
And I'm soakin' so hard
From the sweat that I could take my clothes off
I done fuckin' raked the whole yard
Should sit back and shake the gold off
But I'm already gone
I got a vision like Tela
Songs, in an envelope like letters
Lettuce, green, money, long
Wolf pack send the cow's home
And I'll keep makin' these albums
Yeah you might have heard a dial tone
But I was on the other line when I hung up the phone
I'll send a postcard when I leave
And think about you when I dream
And when I'm up under them high beams
I'll reflect that shining
So you can feel the heat of light
And life of father, son of Diane
Yeah I've done come a long way from Dixie Land
Take my hand

Three times in a row you've been late on the rent (three...)
Four times before you did the same old shit, yeah

Baby done grown up, rockin' that beard like a grown up
Fuck gettin' toned up, let the Glock talk
I'm on gone and hush
Just like daddy taught me, wait I didn't have one
Fuck it, I'm happy for him, cause he caught a bad one
I popped outta that Easy Bake, landed in 'Bama, clean and safe
Dropped outta high school, reason, hey
I'm already high from a seedless eighth
And they wonder why I speak this way

Fifteen bands, diamonds fallin' off my neck
Where the rest? Where the rest? You talkin' 'bout baguettes? (Where it at?)
'Til the homies catch you slippin', rip the Cuban off ya neck
Know you don't wanna move back to DC
Shake it, daddy has ya drippin' like Fiji
Kill the pussy 'til I'm talkin' like ouija
You got a Range, why you talkin' like you need me? (Bitch)

Singin' through the block, singin' through the block
Cookin' like the Rock, I'm cookin' like I'm Bach
Serve it to my sons, I serve it 'til it's done
I just do my dance when they wanna see me run (See me run, see me run)
Bitch, I am Shawn Mendes
I just touched down like the mothafuckin' Jets (Like the mothafuckin' Jets)
Now I'm in Paris, smokin' baguettes (Poppin' pills)
Eating calamari with Ellen, gettin' rich (Gettin' rich, gettin' rich)
I hop off the train, I hop off the plane
Ain't nothin' wrong, baby, ain't nothin' changed
I talk to dogs and the dogs talk to me
I got the sauce, it's bolognese

[Verse 4: Rich Brian & Joji]
Ayy, uh
It's bolognese, bitch (Ayy), I'm chillin' with your chick (Ayy)
And we crying, watchin' Les Mis'
She got me something, let's just say she left my hotel brainless (Ayy)
I like my women short and loud, like the movie trailers (Ayy)
My money tall, it's lookin' like it's playin' for the Lakers (Yuh)
Cameras on me everywhere I move (When I move)
Joji in the booth, he lookin' cute (He cute as fuck)
She comin' over, we gon' cook some food (Cook some food)
Even though we know I'm only eatin' cooch (Ayy)
Shoutout to August even though we never hang when I'm in town (Bitch)
Gettin' top by flight attendants, call that shit head in the clouds (Ayy)
I get motivated when they talkin' down and give me doubt (Woo)
I don't call it paradise, man, I just call that shit my house (Woo, woo)
Three bedrooms, two bath, one pool, one fireplace
Two palm trees, 37 bitches smashed, uh
One driveway, deep voice, good dick
Don't be surprised that she chose me, I provided what you lacked (Ayy)

Got the flu with the tea remedy for my boo thang

Ask me why she said goodbye, why baby dyin' white walls
Cigarettes over skyfall, writing this like it's my song

I could see that she loves me, I know her heart is heavy

549,Spanish Harlem,"[Verse 1]
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street
Right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

[Verse 2]
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal
That looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon
I'm going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in my garden

I'm going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Bewildered, lost in a dream
In the love I need why did we part

Wishing your heart could feel
What's in my heart
Must i have sleepless night
And endless days
Oh love why did you keep my soul
Without a spark I'm in the dark
Bewildered
I need your, i need your i need your guiding hand

How you can love me, how you can love me

Merry go round...
Look...

[Verse 1]
Summer day
Bobby and this girl would wake up every summer day
This boy and girl had nothing, they were runaways
So in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
Never had a silver spoon present in the past
Now at last, the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
Told her bring him a slab, a cotton swab, and a match
And told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
Like “baby I have a plan, come with me to this place
Baby give me your hand, now flip it give me a vein
Baby take off your belt, we’ll use it as a restraint”
She sees that it starts to melt, he reaches inside a case
Fills the needle with food, flicks the needle with haste
Brings the needle to her, she isn’t right in the face
The boy can tell that she’s scared, he says “I love you, okay?”
Then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby?!”

[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown

Merry, merry, merry go round

[Verse 2]
Her dress drops, her head drops
Swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle, he just watches
But he was not Bobby, see Bobby had joined the army
Been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
Everyone of the dealers, everyone hears her squealing
Trading pussy for product, she did anything for that feeling
But then she started that feeling, early morning she’s kneelin’
In front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
That she’s expecting a child
This woman is living foul
She’s only 20 years old
And hardly can even smile
Ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
Sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
News of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
Now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
No mattress, so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
As a letter’s at the door reading:
“I’ll be home tomorrow. love, Bobby”

Merry, merry, merry go round

[Verse 3]
Knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
Bobby’s nervous, his heart starts to beat faster
He hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
She sold his phone for a hit, damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
But his drug hit her like a cancer
And he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
Passenger seat in his Acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
Under the words ""happily ever after”
He walks into the house, it’s a fuckin’ disaster
Every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
Holds his breath, he knows what he smells isn’t natural
Looks down, it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“Baby please, baby please!!!""
""Wake up!!!”
He screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
Inside was a child
And realizes it was his…
*gun shot*
Summer day, 
An entire family died on that summer day
‘cause a facade made a girl give her love away
But those were Bobby’s consequences that he had to pay
Love is pain

Like how many papers is this man signin', I'm back wit' the backpack rap
Man I'm thinkin' that this shit finna make them scat, got a bag full of cash if we talkin' 'bout that
Run, run it like Forrest Gump can you feel that, ayy
I'm a renaissance man, if you wanna get a feat you not gon' get response man
I be hotter than some shit your mom cook in a sauce pan
Don't be jealous, don't be rude, go back to rollin' up grams
People think I'm sick as shit but I'm just eatin' on ham
Wanna beat me in my game then bitch I'm settin' up camp
When the females hear my name I know they pussy all damp
Mr. Veterinarian I make that kitty go ham (Damn)

Ballin', only seventeen, my skin is green
Watching numbers goin' up that's just the everyday routine
All my old friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube I always hit 'em with no vaseline

Always sayin' no when you ask 'em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin' up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin' on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin' all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie

You got cash, buy some chains, I buy houses ain't that strange
You ain't shit, I get lit, all you do is counterfeit

Shit I'm thirsty give it back, and she blondy just like Zac
(""Who the fuck is Zac?"" ""high school musical"")
Bitch hold my stacks I'm 30 minutes late to France
Gotta get this cash, never give no chance, better bounce that ass, paid her an advance
Got me through this day, sippin' on Bombay, I don't trust you gotta take this survey
Man I don't look back, never cut no slack, better get way back, 'fore yo ass get smacked, uh
Memphis flow but I'm from Jakarta ho, never understood my hustle but I guess the more you know
Checkin' on your Instagram I see that shit is going slow, always hating on the progress man yo ass has gotta go

Come along, catch a Heffalump
Sit with me on a muddy clump
We'll sing a song of days gone by
Run along now, don’t be glum
Get you gone, now, have some fun
Don't be long, for the end is nigh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't let moments pass along
And waste before your eyes
March with me and the borogoves
Come with me and the slithy toves
And never ask us why

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

[Bridge]
We'll be here when the world slows down
And the sunbeams fade away
Keeping time by a pendulum
As the fabric starts to fray
There’s no such thing as time to kill
Nor time to throw away
So, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty
Thrice for another day

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

[Verse 2]
Come with me, catch a rare type specimen
Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton
We'll break our fast with friends
Once we're fed, we shall disappear rapidly
Many moons to the west of here and happily
Our journey never ends

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shut your ears when sirens sing,
Tie armbands to your feet
Listen up and you won't go wrong again
Float along on a verse-less song and then
Get to where the two ends meet

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom

That I'm leaving town tomorrow
I'll cause you no more sorrow
I'll just have a cup of coffee then I'll go
I brought the money like the lawyer said to do
It won't replace all the heartaches I've caused you
It won't take the place of loving you, I know-ow-ow-ow
I'll just have a cup of coffee then I'll go
Tell the kids I came by awhile last night
And I kissed them while they slept so tight
Make my cup of coffee sweet and make it warm
Just the way you used to be here in my arms
I'll have another half a cup and then I'll go",Claude Gray,1961,"[84, 86]",2
556,The Very Thought Of You,"The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do

I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me, that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you…
You'll never know how slow the moments go
‘til I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you
My love

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you…
You'll never know how slow the moments go
‘til I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower

The very thought of you

Me dijeron que no hay nada igual
Allí todo lo podés

Estás siempre en el medio
No sabés lo que querés

No tenés tiempo para ver
Te digo que estoy loce pero vos no me creés
Yo no se si te vas a ir
Yo sólo te pido, yo solo te digo salí

You could have been all I wanted
But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the surest of favors
But if you really loved me
You would have endured my world
Well if you're just as I presumed
A whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do
And if so here we stop
Then never again
Will you see this in your life

[Chorus]
Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

[Verse 2]
You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played letter
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep
But if you could just write me out
To neverless wonder, happy will I become
Be true that this is no option
So with sin, I condemn you
Demon play, demon out

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

Always and always
Gladly I vow
To love you madly
To need you badly

563,Ground Hog,"[Intro]
""What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare.""

[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri for Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone, put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitchin’, her rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
Pretendin' to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it became my new religion

[Interlude]
""I remember it clearly, even today.""

[Verse 2]
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to The Wizard
You ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones
All I remember doing's wishin' for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas, bitch!
It's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' system
Made that final manoeuvre to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this
That's how I knew my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed
To do this shit; never quit, too persistent

[Interlude]
""Carved an underground empire.""

[Verse 3]
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
You, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, I fuckin' got that bitch in
A headlock, cut off its oxygen, Slim
Is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cinder blocks in the wind
Now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
Is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts – shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement, but discouragin'
The rappers, the rap game's god
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
More merciless than the first is
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
To get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka

[Interlude]
""That you'll not escape my vengeance.""

[Verse 4]
But the dumpy kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into a non-humble Don
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo
On the fuckin' Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
So mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path
And take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood
Was burnin', return of the no good and I won't quit

[Interlude]
""And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed...""

[Hook]
And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head

[Bridge]
I'm a monster, mutt
I'ma turn into a monster
I'm a monster, mutt
With my dick in your mouth all day!

Took a short step forward
And he's turnin' around
He saw the bull comin' at his feet
He grabbed the red sombrero
And his bag he packed
And he headed for the nearest backstreet

As he started to charge
He hit the hard concrete wall
Said that there was a smile on his face
And that was the end of it all

A rockin type a boogie is the kind a song
That makes this little baby wanna sing along
And though he maybe gets the tune alittle wrong
He still goes (boogie-on-na-day)

He isn't too young to really feel the beat
He rocks back and forth in his little seat
He claps both his hands and he taps his feet

I know there isnt anyone to take a bet
But surely hes the youngest teenager yet
And probably the hippest of the diaper set
Cause he goes (go man, I like that!)

He strolls in his stroller with the radio on
He doesn't go to sleep until the musics gone
He imitates the singer in the group
With a low down voice (dug-a-dug-a)

571,Mr. Pride,"How much hundred seats in parliament
Its so unfair but so clear
Don't none of them represent me
And ain't one of them represent my peers
And it don't matter who we vote for, nor who gets in
The poor keep dying and the rich keep living
Mothers keep losing their children to the system
They stay strong while we remain victims
Telling us to hope for higher things
Educate yourself ain't that how ya'll say it
But they keep increasing the fee
Knowing full well that we can't pay it
And did you stop and listen before you started dishing
Our tax for ammunition to kill innocent children
When right in front of you we can't cope
We hungry, homeless, unemployed and broke
Were dying, the health service is a joke
You said things would change when you wanted our votes

And we continue to die

But yet who's gonna protect me from the beasts
They ain't got my interest at heart
They ain't my friends
Ain't got a enemy alive as evil as the system
So much corruption and this gun shit won't end
And all they sit and f***ing do is blame 50 Cent
Please, now take responsibility
Who's putting them runs on our streets
And who's pumping drugs into our community
Controlling the propaganda on my T.V
And who's molding our children's ideologies
And taking away their opportunity
Were killing each other so we can live above our means
Cause what we earn can't even buy a fraction of our dreams
And wonder why so many have become fiends
Its so hard to live poor and keep your hands clean
So I am keeping mind together
And pray that god forgives my sins
Its real hard living the life were living

Whiskey sour lemonade
Fences up my barricade
I had heart, you had spades
I could see the color in your face as it fades
And that's how it is, ain't no riddle
Crunchy on the edge but soft in the middle (middle)
I got a lot, you got a little
I'mma play war drums, you play the fiddle
Play it real slow, lean on the bow
Everybody sad when they miss a free throw
Lost your control, I'm on a roll
Right all along and I knew it in my soul

[Chorus: Amy & Nick]
I told you so
Don't wanna brag, but you already know, oh-oh
I told you so
Don't wanna brag, but you already know
You already know
I told you, I told you
I told you so, oh
I told you, I told you

[Verse 2: Amy]
Fa-fa-fa
Feels so good, doesn't it?
Winnin' while they flubbin' it
I was right, you was wrong
Figured I'd write it in a hip hop song
Was it so hard to believe
I can make it bein' me?
Drank too much ouzo
My gosh, you know
People say a lot of things, make you feel real small
Push them out the way, iced latte tall
I don't really care, I'm already there
Caffeinated up to my eyes, I swear
I'm on the top, you on the flop
Going so long, and I'm never gonna stop
Lost your control, I'm on a roll
Right all along and I knew it in my soul

[Chorus: Amy & Nick]
I told you so
Don't wanna brag, but you already know, oh-oh
I told you so
Don't wanna brag, but you already know

I told you so, oh
I told you, I told you
I told you so

[Verse 3: Amy]
La-la-la
Look at me now, fifteen rounds
Bottle in my hand, pour a little on the ground
Next time you wanna talk trash I'mma put it on blast
You can get it if you ask for it
Put it in the middle finger of the fat ladies singing out
Shatter every glass house, ni hao (oops, uh, ha!)
Meanwhile, I smile (oh? ooh)
Then I go animal style (ooh!)
I be racking up another million
Making me another killin' superwoman on the top dollar bill
And yeah, I muster up a lot of feelings
Tell me what you really think about it
Kidding, I don't even care
Nobody listens to a full gold-coated hater
Be a baller, not a traitor
Please, got me on my knees
Talk to you later, na-na-na-na
Whoop, there it go!
Right all along and I knew it in my soul

Don't wanna brag, but you already know, oh-oh

573,Hearts Of Stone,"(B. Springsteen)

You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face
And you try so hard to see, girl
The way things were when we were at your place
Everyday was just you and me, girl
And you cry because things ain't like before
Well, don't you know it can't be that way anymore
But don't worry baby

I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
This is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone

If there was something, baby, that I could do
Something that would last, honey, I would
But you should know better than to think that you
Can return to the past
So close your eyes and I'll be there
Hold you once more,not go anywhere
I wish I could, babe

But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
This is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone

And you cry because things get so strange so fast
And you cry because nothing good ever lasts
Well, I know babe
Yes, I know, babe

But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
'Cause this is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone

This is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone

I used to have this girl, let's say her name was Mona
Mona, fine young sugar comin out of Arizona
5 ft. 6 straight thick with a switch
And a set of them juicy-ass lips (Mmh...)
Kinky, just like me
She can take a straight gee
And put him down for the count 1, 2, 3
Needless to say I was kickin it
Cause I know when I'm the only one gettin it
But - ooh, things change when you don't maintain
The same game you got her with, mayn
Flew back home, and I was slippin
Cause as soon as I left, another brother starts spittin
Throwin drag about wantin a family
Tryin to front because he wanna be manly
Tellin my girl how I'm playin the field
Boy, you'se a jake for real
Now a player I like, but you know I can't stand no snitch
Tryin to front like he rich
Done shot your credit, cause you bought you a new E
320, and you wanna be a hoe like me
Now you done salted my game
Told my girl I'm a player, and you bought her a ring
You paid a lotta money just to grab her
I'ma tell you like this, trick: you can have her

(You can have her)

I gotta do what I gotta do
Baby girl's through, so I need somethin new
You can't keep a good mack down
I get around cause I got a tight thing up in Sea-Town
5'9"" with dimples
Caramel skin, straight fine, hella tight, no pimples
Thinkin my game was concrete
But I gotta watch for them other entertainers and athletes
Especially the ones who wanna settle down
Cause they'll beg and drink out your shoes and get they nose brown
Just the kinda man you wanted, ain't it, honey?
A big buff dumb-ass fool with hella money
Down to spend till his knees bend
Then the athlete's broke and his girl's in the wind
And my girl gets mad, cause I never spend time like I'm s'posed to
Plus I'm a boaster
Shaggin up too damn quick, now she's lookin for a sugar daddy
Just to get a '96 Caddy
A big truck she found
You young scrub on the bench for the Cleveland Browns
He never had nothin, thicker than a cheerleader
Now he got juice, so he eats her
And treats her to a big wad of cash
Too weak, so she left his ass
You can have her

I smack it with the whiffle ball bat, remember that?
One happy black man I be
When my L.A. bunny wanna trip with me
Her name is Teresa
She was freakier than me, but I figured I could please her
She had the long braids
Chocolate sister, loved to cuff men like slaves
Arrived at the house at last
Seen two shades of lipstick on the same wine glass
Provocative artwork around me
Four pink slippers on the floor surround me
One pair's for her, the other pair's for who?
Plus she only lives in a one bedroom
Well hm - it might be on

[Verse 1: G-Riot]

I said, you remind me of the moon, see
I know that you're usually out late partying with stars like a groupie
When it comes to dating, I know that you'd rather not
Only into fly guys, typically an astronaut
But speaking of the last guy that you let close to you
All he did was brag bout how he walked over you
I don't even blame him, what was he supposed to do
You're always acting stuck up, don't deny you know it's true
Every single place you go, People always notice you
But you ain't down to Earth, so you ain't approachable
On top of that you know you cute, so you make it damn tough
Always on that you can look shit but you can't touch
You be getting waves like the center of parades
But never have the decency to lift your fucking hands up
Always out late night, type of girl you can't trust
Always been above the law so you know you can't cuff her like

[Hook: G-Riot]
I hate the way you act, you know it ain't right
The only time I ever see you out is late night
You're not a star but you never have stage fright
Guess the universe is your stage, right? Right
X2

[Verse 2: G-Riot]
See I hate to have to say this, but you're complicated
First you get mad close, then you drift away quick
Always acting brand new, never on the same shit
And everybody knows you be going through your phases
You got Mars and Venus looking at you chasing
Always on a mission to get up in Uranus
Pluto wants to get you open like a flesh wound
Just so he can try to beat it up like the Neptunes
You even got Jupiter saying he could bless you
And he got mad moons but he couldn't get you
Saturn got whips just to make you feel special
Even he don't got enough rings to impress you, I guess you
Got to keep your head up in the clouds
Type to act too fly to ever settle down
So there's really nothing left but to move on to the next
And I'm glad I found a new chick that's better than you now, cuz

[Hook: G-Riot]
I hate the way you act, you know it ain't right
The only time I ever see you out is late night
You're not a star but you never have stage fright
Guess the universe is your stage, right? Right
X2

[Verse 3: G-Riot]
See I got a new chick
Bossy and she run shit
She don't even make bread
She be making sun chips
Everybody feels her
When we out in public
Clouds get darker everytime that hun dips
She can be a hot head
Not the one to fuck with
But she always brightens up my day, no discussion
Body shaped curvy
Call her miss seduction
Hot enough to dry the river Brittney cried for Justin
A lot of people sweat her, but I tell them move on
You can take a glance but I wouldn't look for too long
Usually she shining, people say its too strong
I just love the fact that she does it wit no jewels on
Never call her luke warm, call her Mrs. Flamer
If we had a daughter, I bet you we would name her
Little miss sunshine, no lie you gotta be the one
And irreplaceable cuz' you the sun",G-Riot,1961,"[70, 72, 78, 83, 92]",5

We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction

And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times

Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

Go tell your friends about it (About it)

This year I'ma focus on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen

Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know

[Verse 3]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

It's not easy to conceal
When you're so touchable
People will hide indifference
Just to be touchable

When they are touchable

Sincerely touchable

Guilt, compassion, or Achilles Heel
Little feet march down grey matter hill
Then panic occurs, no seeds to spill
What's the matter now
Please look up and speak

I wonder when and I wonder how

585,(Theme from) The Great Impostor,"IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF the reign of Aurungzebe, Abdalla, King of the Lesser Bucharia, a lineal descendant from the Great Zingis, having abdicated the throne in favor of his son, set out on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Prophet; and, passing into India through the delightful valley of Cashmere, rested for a short time at Delhi on his way. He was entertained by Aurungzebe in a style of magnificent hospitality, worthy alike of the visitor and the host, and was afterwards escorted with the same splendor to Surat, where he embarked for Arabia. During the stay of the Royal Pilgrim at Delhi, a marriage was agreed upon between the Prince, his son, and the youngest daughter of the Emperor, LALLA ROOKH; a Princess described by the poets of her time as more beautiful than Leila, Shirine, Dewildé, or any of those heroines whose names and loves embellish the songs of Persia and Hindostan. It was intended that the nuptials should be celebrated at Cashmere; where the young King, as soon as the cares of the empire would permit, was to meet, for the first time, his lovely bride, and, after a few months' repose in that enchanting valley, conduct her over the snowy hills into Bucharia.

The day of LALLA ROOKH'S departure from Delhi was as splendid as sunshine and pageantry could make it. The bazaars and baths were all covered with the richest tapestry; hundreds of gilded barges upon the Jumna floated with their banners shining in the water; while through the streets groups of beautiful children went strewing the most delicious flowers around, as in that Persian festival called the Scattering of the Roses; till every part of the city was as fragrant as if a caravan of musk from Khoten had passed through it. The Princess, having taken leave of her kind father, who at parting hung a cornelian of Yemen round her neck, on which was inscribed a verse from the Koran, and having sent a considerable present to the Fakirs, who kept up the Perpetual Lamp in her sister's tomb, meekly ascended the palankeen prepared for her; and while Aurungzebe stood to take a last look from his balcony, the procession moved slowly on the road to Lahore.

Seldom had the Eastern world seen a cavalcade so superb. From the gardens in the suburbs to the Imperial palace, it was one unbroken line of splendor. The gallant appearance of the Rajahs and Mogul lords, distinguished by those insignia of the Emperor's favor, the feathers of the egret of Cashmere in their turbans, and the small silver-rimm'd kettle-drums at the bows of their saddles; --the costly armor of their cavaliers, who vied, on this occasion, with the guards of the great Keder Khan, in the brightness of their silver battle-axes and the massiness of their maces of gold; --the glittering of the gilt pine-apple on the tops of the palankeens; --the embroidered trappings of the elephants, bearing on their backs small turrets, in the shape of little antique temples, within which the Ladies of LALLA ROOKH lay as it were enshrined; --the rose-colored veils of the Princess's own sumptuous litter, at the front of which a fair young female slave sat fanning her through the curtains, with feathers of the Argus pheasant's wing; and the lovely troop of Tartarian and Cashmerian maids of honor, whom the young King had sent to accompany his bride, and who rode on each side of the litter, upon small Arabian horses; --all was brilliant, tasteful, and magnificent, and pleased even the critical and fastidious FADLADEEN, Great Nazir or Chamberlain of the Haram, who was borne in his palankeen immediately after the Princess, and considered himself not the least important personage of the pageant.

FADLADEEN was a judge of everything, --from the pencilling of a Circassian's eyelids to the deepest questions of science and literature; from the mixture of a conserve of rose-leaves to the composition of an epic poem: and such influence had his opinion upon the various tastes of the day, that all the cooks and poets of Delhi stood in awe of him. His political conduct and opinions were founded upon that line of Sadi, --""Should the Prince at noon-day say, It is night, declare that you behold the moon and stars."" --And his zeal for religion, of which Aurungzebe was a munificent protector, was about as disinterested as that of the goldsmith who fell in love with the diamond eyes of the idol of Jaghernaut.

During the first days of their journey, LALLA ROOKH, who had passed all her life within the shadow of the Royal Gardens of Delhi, found enough in the beauty of the scenery through which they passed to interest her mind, and delight her imagination; and when at evening or in the heat of the day they turned off from the high road to those retired and romantic places which had been selected for her encampments,--sometimes, on the banks of a small rivulet, as clear as the waters of the Lake of Pearl; sometimes under the sacred shade of a Banyan tree, from which the view opened upon a glade covered with antelopes; and often in those hidden, embowered spots, described by one from the Isles of the West, as ""places of melancholy, delight, and safety, where all the company around was wild peacocks and turtle-doves;"" --she felt a charm in these scenes, so lovely and so new to her, which, for a time, made her indifferent to every other amusement. But LALLA ROOKH was young, and the young love variety; nor could the conversation of her Ladies and the Great Chamberlain FADLADEEN (the only persons, of course, admitted to her pavilion) sufficiently enliven those many vacant hours, which were devoted neither to the pillow nor the palankeen. There was a little Persian slave who sung sweetly to the Vina, and who, now and then, lulled the Princess to sleep with the ancient ditties of her country, about the loves of Wamak and Ezra, the fair-haired Zal and his mistress Rodahver, not forgetting the combat of Rustam with the terrible White Demon. At other times she was amused by those graceful dancing-girls of Delhi, who had been permitted by the Bramins of the Great Pagoda to attend her, much to the horror of the good Mussulman FADLADEEN, who could see nothing graceful or agreeable in idolaters, and to whom the very tinkling of their golden anklets was an abomination.

But these and many other diversions were repeated till they lost all their charm, and the nights and noon-days were beginning to move heavily, when at length it was recollected that among the attendants sent by the bridegroom, was a young poet of Cashmere, much celebrated throughout the Valley for his manner of reciting the Stories of the East, on whom his Royal Master had conferred the privilege of being admitted to the pavilion of the Princess, that he might help to beguile the tediousness of the journey by some of his most agreeable recitals. At the mention of a poet, FADLADEEN elevated his critical eyebrows and, having refreshed his faculties with a dose of that delicious opium which is distilled from the black poppy of the Thebais, gave orders for the minstrel to be forthwith introduced into the Presence.

The Princess, who had once in her life seen a poet from behind the screens of gauze in her father's hall, and had conceived from that specimen no very favorable ideas of the Caste, expected but little in this new exhibition to interest her; --she felt inclined, however, to alter her opinion on the very first appearance of FERAMORZ. He was a youth about LALLA ROOKH'S own age, and graceful as that idol of women, Crishna, such as he appears to their young imaginations, heroic, beautiful, breathing music from his very eyes, and exalting the religion of his worshippers into love. His dress was simple, yet not without some marks of costliness; and the Ladies of the Princess were not long in discovering that the cloth which encircled his high Tartarian cap, was of the most delicate kind that the shawl-goats of Tibet supply. Here and there, too, over his vest, which was confined by a flowered girdle of Kashan, hung strings of fine pearl, disposed with an air of studied negligence;--nor did the exquisite embroidery of his sandals escape the observation of these fair critics; who, however they might give way to FADLADEEN upon the unimportant topics of religion and government, had the spirit of martyrs in everything relating to such momentous matters as jewels and embroidery.

For the purpose of relieving the pauses of recitation by music, the young Cashmerian held in his hand a kitar; --such as, in old times, the Arab maids of the West used to listen to by moonlight in the gardens of the Alhambra-- and, having premised, with much humility, that the story he was about to relate was founded on the adventures of that Veiled Prophet of Khorassan, who, in the year of the Hegira 163, created such alarm throughout the Eastern Empire, made an obeisance to the Princess, and thus began:--


THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.

In that delightful Province of the Sun,
The first of Persian lands he shines upon.
Where all the loveliest children of his beam,
Flowerets and fruits, blush over every stream,
And, fairest of all streams, the MURGA roves
Among MEROU'S bright palaces and groves;--
There on that throne, to which the blind belief
Of millions raised him, sat the Prophet-Chief,
The Great MOKANNA. O'er his features hung
The Veil, the Silver Veil, which he had flung
In mercy there, to hide from mortal sight
His dazzling brow, till man could bear its light.
For, far less luminous, his votaries said,
Were even the gleams, miraculously shed
O'er MOUSSA'S cheek, when down the Mount he trod
All glowing from the presence of his God!

On either side, with ready hearts and hands,
His chosen guard of bold Believers stands;
Young fire-eyed disputants, who deem their swords,
On points of faith, more eloquent than words;
And such their zeal, there's not a youth with brand
Uplifted there, but at the Chief's command,
Would make his own devoted heart its sheath,
And bless the lips that doomed so dear a death!
In hatred to the Caliph's hue of night,
Their vesture, helms and all, is snowy white;
Their weapons various-- some equipt for speed,
With javelins of the light Kathaian reed;
Or bows of buffalo horn and shining quivers
Filled with the stems that bloom on IRAN'S rivers;
While some, for war's more terrible attacks,
Wield the huge mace and ponderous battle-axe;
And as they wave aloft in morning's beam
The milk-white plumage of their helms, they seem
Like a chenar-tree grove when winter throws
O'er all its tufted heads his feathery snows.

Between the porphyry pillars that uphold
The rich moresque-work of the roof of gold,
Aloft the Haram's curtained galleries rise,
Where thro' the silken net-work, glancing eyes,
From time to time, like sudden gleams that glow
Thro' autumn clouds, shine o'er the pomp below.--
What impious tongue, ye blushing saints, would dare
To hint that aught but Heaven hath placed you there?
Or that the loves of this light world could bind,
In their gross chain, your Prophet's soaring mind?
No-- wrongful thought!-- commissioned from above
To people Eden's bowers with shapes of love,
(Creatures so bright, that the same lips and eyes
They wear on earth will serve in Paradise,)
There to recline among Heaven's native maids,
And crown the Elect with bliss that never fades--
Well hath the Prophet-Chief his bidding done;
And every beauteous race beneath the sun,
From those who kneel at BRAHMA'S burning founts,
To the fresh nymphs bounding o'er YEMEN'S mounts;
From PERSIA'S eyes of full and fawnlike ray,
To the small, half-shut glances of KATHAY;
And GEORGIA'S bloom, and AZAB'S darker smiles,
And the gold ringlets of the Western Isles;
All, all are there; --each Land its flower hath given,
To form that fair young Nursery for Heaven!

But why this pageant now? this armed array?
What triumph crowds the rich Divan to-day
With turbaned heads of every hue and race,
Bowing before that veiled and awful face,
Like tulip-beds, of different shape and dyes,
Bending beneath the invisible West-wind's sighs!
What new-made mystery now for Faith to sign
And blood to seal, as genuine and divine,
What dazzling mimicry of God's own power
Hath the bold Prophet planned to grace this hour?

Not such the pageant now, tho' not less proud;
Yon warrior youth advancing from the crowd
With silver bow, with belt of broidered crape
And fur-bound bonnet of Bucharian shape.
So fiercely beautiful in form and eye,
Like war's wild planet in a summer sky;
That youth to-day, --a proselyte, worth hordes
Of cooler spirits and less practised swords,--
Is come to join, all bravery and belief,
The creed and standard of the heaven-sent Chief.

Tho' few his years, the West already knows
Young AZIM'S fame; --beyond the Olympian snows
Ere manhood darkened o'er his downy cheek,
O'erwhelmed in fight and captive to the Greek,
He lingered there, till peace dissolved his chains;--
Oh! who could even in bondage tread the plains
Of glorious GREECE nor feel his spirit rise
Kindling within him? who with heart and eyes
Could walk where Liberty had been nor see
The shining foot-prints of her Deity,
Nor feel those god-like breathings in the air
Which mutely told her spirit had been there?
Not he, that youthful warrior, --no, too well
For his soul's quiet worked the awakening spell;
And now, returning to his own dear land,
Full of those dreams of good that, vainly grand,
Haunt the young heart, --proud views of human-kind,
Of men to Gods exalted and refined,--
False views like that horizon's fair deceit
Where earth and heaven but seem, alas, to meet!--
Soon as he heard an Arm Divine was raised
To right the nations, and beheld, emblazed
On the white flag MOKANNA'S host unfurled,
Those words of sunshine, ""Freedom to the World,""
At once his faith, his sword, his soul obeyed
The inspiring summons; every chosen blade
That fought beneath that banner's sacred text
Seemed doubly edged for this world and the next;
And ne'er did Faith with her smooth bandage bind
Eyes more devoutly willing to be blind,
In virtue's cause; --never was soul inspired
With livelier trust in what it most desired,
Than his, the enthusiast there, who kneeling, pale
With pious awe before that Silver Veil,
Believes the form to which he bends his knee
Some pure, redeeming angel sent to free
This fettered world from every bond and stain,
And bring its primal glories back again!

Low as young AZIM knelt, that motley crowd
Of all earth's nations sunk the knee and bowed,
With shouts of ""ALLA!"" echoing long and loud;
Which high in air, above the Prophet's head,
Hundreds of banners to the sunbeam spread
Waved, like the wings of the white birds that fan
The flying throne of star-taught SOLIMAN.
Then thus he spoke: ""Stranger, tho' new the frame
""Thy soul inhabits now. I've trackt its flame
""For many an age in every chance and change
""Of that existence, thro' whose varied range,--
""As thro' a torch-race where from hand to hand
""The flying youths transmit their shining brand,
""From frame to frame the unextinguisht soul
""Rapidly passes till it reach the goal!

""Nor think 'tis only the gross Spirits warmed
""With duskier fire and for earth's medium formed
""That run this course; --Beings the most divine
""Thus deign thro' dark mortality to shine.
""Such was the Essence that in ADAM dwelt,
""To which all Heaven except the Proud One knelt:
""Such the refined Intelligence that glowed
""In MOUSSA'S frame,--and thence descending flowed
""Thro' many a Prophet's breast;--in ISSA shone
""And in MOHAMMED burned; till hastening on.
""(As a bright river that from fall to fall
""In many a maze descending bright thro' all,
""Finds some fair region where, each labyrinth past,
""In one full lake of light it rests at last)
""That Holy Spirit settling calm and free
""From lapse or shadow centres all in me!

Again throughout the assembly at these words
Thousands of voices rung: the warrior's swords
Were pointed up at heaven; a sudden wind
In the open banners played, and from behind
Those Persian hangings that but ill could screen
The Harem's loveliness, white hands were seen
Waving embroidered scarves whose motion gave
A perfume forth--like those the Houris wave
When beckoning to their bowers the immortal Brave.

""But these,"" pursued the Chief ""are truths sublime,
""That claim a holier mood and calmer time
""Than earth allows us now; --this sword must first
""The darkling prison-house of mankind burst.
""Ere Peace can visit them or Truth let in
""Her wakening daylight on a world of sin.
""But then, --celestial warriors, then when all
""Earth's shrines and thrones before our banner fall,
""When the glad Slave shall at these feet lay down
""His broken chain, the tyrant Lord his crown,
""The Priest his book, the Conqueror his wreath,
""And from the lips of Truth one mighty breath
""Shall like a whirlwind scatter in its breeze
""That whole dark pile of human mockeries:--
""Then shall the reign of mind commence on earth,
""And starting fresh as from a second birth,
""Man in the sunshine of the world's new spring
""Shall walk transparent like some holy thing!
""Then too your Prophet from his angel brow
""Shall cast the Veil that hides its splendors now,
""And gladdened Earth shall thro' her wide expanse
""Bask in the glories of this countenance!

""For thee, young warrior, welcome! --thou hast yet
""Some tasks to learn, some frailties to forget,
""Ere the white war-plume o'er thy brow can wave;--
""But, once my own, mine all till in the grave!""

The pomp is at an end--the crowds are gone--
Each ear and heart still haunted by the tone
Of that deep voice, which thrilled like ALLA'S own!
The Young all dazzled by the plumes and lances,
The glittering throne and Haram's half-caught glances,
The Old deep pondering on the promised reign
Of peace and truth, and all the female train
Ready to risk their eyes could they but gaze
A moment on that brow's miraculous blaze!

But there was one among the chosen maids
Who blushed behind the gallery's silken shades,
One, to whose soul the pageant of to-day
Has been like death: --you saw her pale dismay,
Ye wondering sisterhood, and heard the burst
Of exclamation from her lips when first
She saw that youth, too well, too dearly known,
Silently kneeling at the Prophet's throne.

Ah ZELICA! there was a time when bliss
Shone o'er thy heart from every look of his,
When but to see him, hear him, breathe the air
In which he dwelt was thy soul's fondest prayer;
When round him hung such a perpetual spell,
Whate'er he did, none ever did so well.
Too happy days! when, if he touched a flower
Or gem of thine, 'twas sacred from that hour;
When thou didst study him till every tone
And gesture and dear look became thy own.--
Thy voice like his, the changes of his face
In thine reflected with still lovelier grace,
Like echo, sending back sweet music, fraught
With twice the aerial sweetness it had brought!
Yet now he comes, --brighter than even he
E'er beamed before, --but, ah! not bright for thee;
No-- dread, unlookt for, like a visitant
From the other world he comes as if to haunt
Thy guilty soul with dreams of lost delight,
Long lost to all but memory's aching sight:--
Sad dreams! as when the Spirit of our Youth
Returns in sleep, sparkling with all the truth
And innocence once ours and leads us back,
In mournful mockery o'er the shining track
Of our young life and points out every ray
Of hope and peace we've lost upon the way!

Once happy pair! --In proud BOKHARA'S groves,
Who had not heard of their first youthful loves?
Born by that ancient flood, which from its spring
In the dark Mountains swiftly wandering,
Enriched by every pilgrim brook that shines
With relics from BUCHARIA'S ruby mines.
And, lending to the CASPIAN half its strength,
In the cold Lake of Eagles sinks at length;--
There, on the banks of that bright river born,
The flowers that hung above its wave at morn
Blest not the waters as they murmured by
With holier scent and lustre than the sigh
And virgin-glance of first affection cast
Upon their youth's smooth current as it past!
But war disturbed this vision, --far away
From her fond eyes summoned to join the array
Of PERSIA'S warriors on the hills of THRACE,
The youth exchanged his sylvan dwelling-place
For the rude tent and war-field's deathful clash;
His ZELICA'S sweet glances for the flash
Of Grecian wild-fire, and Love's gentle chains
For bleeding bondage on BYZANTIUM'S plains.

Month after month in widowhood of soul
Drooping the maiden saw two summers roll
Their suns away-- but, ah, how cold and dim
Even summer suns when not beheld with him!
From time to time ill-omened rumors came
Like spirit-tongues muttering the sick man's name
Just ere he dies: --at length those sounds of dread
Fell withering on her soul, ""AZIM is dead!""
Oh Grief beyond all other griefs when fate
First leaves the young heart lone and desolate
In the wide world without that only tie
For which it loved to live or feared to die;--
Lorn as the hung-up lute, that near hath spoken
Since the sad day its master-chord was broken!

Fond maid, the sorrow of her soul was such,
Even reason sunk, --blighted beneath its touch;
And tho' ere long her sanguine spirit rose
Above the first dead pressure of its woes,
Tho' health and bloom returned, the delicate chain
Of thought once tangled never cleared again.
Warm, lively, soft as in youth's happiest day,
The mind was still all there, but turned astray,--
A wandering bark upon whose pathway shone
All stars of heaven except the guiding one!
Again she smiled, nay, much and brightly smiled,
But 'twas a lustre, strange, unreal, wild;
And when she sung to her lute's touching strain,
'Twas like the notes, half ecstasy, half pain,
The bulbul utters ere her soul depart,
When, vanquisht by some minstrel's powerful art,
She dies upon the lute whose sweetness broke her heart!

Such was the mood in which that mission found,
Young ZELICA, --that mission which around
The Eastern world in every region blest
With woman's smile sought out its loveliest
To grace that galaxy of lips and eyes
Which the Veiled Prophet destined for the skies:--
And such quick welcome as a spark receives
Dropt on a bed of Autumn's withered leaves,
Did every tale of these enthusiasts find
In the wild maiden's sorrow-blighted mind.
All fire at once the maddening zeal she caught:--
Elect of Paradise! blest, rapturous thought!
Predestined bride, in heaven's eternal dome,
Of some brave youth-- ha! durst they say ""of some?""
No-- of the one, one only object traced
In her heart's core too deep to be effaced;
The one whose memory, fresh as life, is twined
With every broken link of her lost mind;
Whose image lives tho' Reason's self be wreckt
Safe mid the ruins of her intellect!

Alas, poor ZELICA! it needed all
The fantasy which held thy mind in thrall
To see in that gay Haram's glowing maids
A sainted colony for Eden's shades;
Or dream that he, --of whose unholy flame
Thou wert too soon the victim, --shining came
From Paradise to people its pure sphere
With souls like thine which he hath ruined here!
No-- had not reason's light totally set,
And left thee dark thou hadst an amulet
In the loved image graven on thy heart
Which would have saved thee from the tempter's art,
And kept alive in all its bloom of breath
That purity whose fading is love's death!--
But lost, inflamed, --a restless zeal took place
Of the mild virgin's still and feminine grace;
First of the Prophets favorites, proudly first
In zeal and charms, too well the Impostor nurst
Her soul's delirium in whose active flame,
Thus lighting up a young, luxuriant frame,
He saw more potent sorceries to bind
To his dark yoke the spirits of mankind,
More subtle chains than hell itself e'er twined.
No art was spared, no witchery; --all the skill
His demons taught him was employed to fill
Her mind with gloom and ecstasy by turns--
That gloom, thro' which Frenzy but fiercer burns,
That ecstasy which from the depth of sadness
Glares like the maniac's moon whose light is madness!

'Twas from a brilliant banquet where the sound
Of poesy and music breathed around,
Together picturing to her mind and ear
The glories of that heaven, her destined sphere,
Where all was pure, where every stain that lay
Upon the spirit's light should pass away,
And realizing more than youthful love
E'er wisht or dreamed, she should for ever rove
Thro' fields of fragrance by her AZIM'S side,
His own blest, purified, eternal bride!--
T was from a scene, a witching trance like this,
He hurried her away, yet breathing bliss,
To the dim charnel-house; --thro' all its steams
Of damp and death led only by those gleams
Which foul Corruption lights, as with design
To show the gay and proud she too can shine--
And passing on thro' upright ranks of Dead
Which to the maiden, doubly crazed by dread,
Seemed, thro' the bluish death-light round them cast,
To move their lips in mutterings as she past--
There in that awful place, when each had quaft
And pledged in silence such a fearful draught,
Such-- oh! the look and taste of that red bowl
Will haunt her till she dies-- he bound her soul
By a dark oath, in hell's own language framed,
Never, while earth his mystic presence claimed,
While the blue arch of day hung o'er them both,
Never, by that all-imprecating oath,
In joy or sorrow from his side to sever.--
She swore and the wide charnel echoed ""Never, never!""

From that dread hour, entirely, wildly given
To him and-- she believed, lost maid!-- to heaven;
Her brain, her heart, her passions all inflamed,
How proud she stood, when in full Haram named
The Priestess of the Faith! --how flasht her eyes
With light, alas, that was not of the skies,
When round in trances only less than hers
She saw the Haram kneel, her prostrate worshippers.
Well might MOKANNA think that form alone
Had spells enough to make the world his own:--
Light, lovely limbs to which the spirit's play
Gave motion, airy as the dancing spray,
When from its stem the small bird wings away;
Lips in whose rosy labyrinth when she smiled
The soul was lost, and blushes, swift and wild
As are the momentary meteors sent
Across the uncalm but beauteous firmament.
And then her look-- oh! where's the heart so wise
Could unbewildered meet those matchless eyes?
Quick, restless, strange, but exquisite withal,
Like those of angels just before their fall;
Now shadowed with the shames of earth-- now crost
By glimpses of the Heaven her heart had lost;
In every glance there broke without control,
The flashes of a bright but troubled soul,
Where sensibility still wildly played
Like lightning round the ruins it had made!

And such was now young ZELICA-- so changed
From her who some years since delighted ranged
The almond groves that shade BOKHARA'S tide
All life and bliss with AZIM by her side!
So altered was she now, this festal day,
When, mid the proud Divan's dazzling array,
The vision of that Youth whom she had loved,
Had wept as dead, before her breathed and moved;--
When-- bright, she thought, as if from Eden's track
But half-way trodden, he had wandered back
Again to earth, glistening with Eden's light--
Her beauteous AZIM shone before her sight.

O Reason! who shall say what spells renew,
When least we look for it, thy broken clew!
Thro' what small vistas o'er the darkened brain
Thy intellectual day-beam bursts again;
And how like forts to which beleaguerers win
Unhoped-for entrance thro' some friend within,
One clear idea, wakened in the breast
By memory's magic, lets in all the rest.
Would it were thus, unhappy girl, with thee!
But tho' light came, it came but partially;
Enough to show the maze, in which thy sense
Wandered about, --but not to guide it thence;
Enough to glimmer o'er the yawning wave,
But not to point the harbor which might save.
Hours of delight and peace, long left behind,
With that dear form came rushing o'er her mind;
But, oh! to think how deep her soul had gone
In shame and falsehood since those moments shone;
And then her oath-- there madness lay again,
And shuddering, back she sunk into her chain
Of mental darkness, as if blest to flee
From light whose every glimpse was agony!
Yet one relief this glance of former years
Brought mingled with its pain, --tears, floods of tears,
Long frozen at her heart, but now like rills
Let loose in spring-time from the snowy hills,
And gushing warm after a sleep of frost,
Thro' valleys where their flow had long been lost.

Sad and subdued, for the first time her frame
Trembled with horror when the summons came
(A summons proud and rare, which all but she,
And she, till now, had heard with ecstasy,)
To meet MOKANNA at his place of prayer,
A garden oratory cool and fair
By the stream's side, where still at close of day
The Prophet of the Veil retired to pray,
Sometimes alone-- but oftener far with one,
One chosen nymph to share his orison.

Of late none found such favor in his sight
As the young Priestess; and tho', since that night
When the death-caverns echoed every tone
Of the dire oath that made her all his own,
The Impostor sure of his infatuate prize
Had more than once thrown off his soul's disguise,
And uttered such unheavenly, monstrous things,
As even across the desperate wanderings
Of a weak intellect, whose lamp was out,
Threw startling shadows of dismay and doubt;--
Yet zeal, ambition, her tremendous vow,
The thought, still haunting her, of that bright brow,
Whose blaze, as yet from mortal eye concealed,
Would soon, proud triumph! be to her revealed,
To her alone; --and then the hope, most dear,
Most wild of all, that her transgression here
Was but a passage thro' earth's grosser fire,
From which the spirit would at last aspire,
Even purer than before, --as perfumes rise
Thro' flame and smoke, most welcome to the skies--
And that when AZIM's fond, divine embrace
Should circle her in heaven, no darkening trace
Would on that bosom he once loved remain.
But all be bright, be pure, be his again!--
These were the wildering dreams, whose curst deceit
Had chained her soul beneath the tempter's feet,
And made her think even damning falsehood sweet.
But now that Shape, which had appalled her view,
That Semblance-- oh how terrible, if true!
Which came across her frenzy's full career
With shock of consciousness, cold, deep, severe.
As when in northern seas at midnight dark
An isle of ice encounters some swift bark,
And startling all its wretches from their sleep
By one cold impulse hurls them to the deep;--
So came that shock not frenzy's self could bear,
And waking up each long-lulled image there,
But checkt her headlong soul to sink it in despair!

Wan and dejected, thro' the evening dusk,
She now went slowly to that small kiosk,
Where, pondering alone his impious schemes,
MOKANNA waited her-- too wrapt in dreams
Of the fair-ripening future's rich success,
To heed the sorrow, pale and spiritless,
That sat upon his victim's downcast brow,
Or mark how slow her step, how altered now
From the quick, ardent Priestess, whose light bound
Came like a spirit's o'er the unechoing ground,--
From that wild ZELICA whose every glance
Was thrilling fire, whose every thought a trance!

Upon his couch the Veiled MOKANNA lay,
While lamps around-- not such as lend their ray,
Glimmering and cold, to those who nightly pray
In holy KOOM, or MECCA'S dim arcades,--
But brilliant, soft, such lights as lovely maids.
Look loveliest in, shed their luxurious glow
Upon his mystic Veil's white glittering flow.
Beside him, 'stead of beads and books of prayer,
Which the world fondly thought he mused on there,
Stood Vases, filled with KISIIMEE'S golden wine,
And the red weepings of the SHIRAZ vine;
Of which his curtained lips full many a draught
Took zealously, as if each drop they quaft
Like ZEMZEM'S Spring of Holiness had power
To freshen the soul's virtues into flower!
And still he drank and pondered-- nor could see
The approaching maid, so deep his revery;
At length with fiendish laugh like that which broke
From EBLIS at the Fall of Man he spoke:--
""Yes, ye vile race, for hell's amusement given,
""Too mean for earth, yet claiming kin with heaven;
""God's images, forsooth! --such gods as he
""Whom INDIA serves, the monkey deity;
""Ye creatures of a breath, proud things of clay,
""To whom if LUCIFER, as gran-dams say,
""Refused tho' at the forfeit of heaven's light
""To bend in worship, LUCIFER was right!
""Soon shall I plant this foot upon the neck
""Of your foul race and without fear or check,
""Luxuriating in hate, avenge my shame,
""My deep-felt, long-nurst loathing of man's name!--
""Soon at the head of myriads, blind and fierce
""As hooded falcons, thro' the universe
""I'll sweep my darkening, desolating way,
""Weak man my instrument, curst man my prey!

""Ye wise, ye learned, who grope your dull way on
""By the dim twinkling gleams of ages gone,
""Like superstitious thieves who think the light
""From dead men's marrow guides them best at night--
""Ye shall have honors-- wealth-- yes, Sages, yes--
""I know, grave fools, your wisdom's nothingness;
""Undazzled it can track yon starry sphere,
""But a gilt stick, a bauble blinds it here.
""How I shall laugh, when trumpeted along
""In lying speech and still more lying song,
""By these learned slaves, the meanest of the throng;
""Their wits brought up, their wisdom shrunk so small,
""A sceptre's puny point can wield it all!

""Ye too, believers of incredible creeds,
""Whose faith enshrines the monsters which it breeds;
""Who, bolder even than NEMROD, think to rise
""By nonsense heapt on nonsense to the skies;
""Ye shall have miracles, ay, sound ones too,
""Seen, heard, attested, everything-- but true.
""Your preaching zealots too inspired to seek
""One grace of meaning for the things they speak:
""Your martyrs ready to shed out their blood,
""For truths too heavenly to be understood;
""And your State Priests, sole venders of the lore,
""That works salvation; --as, on AVA'S shore,
""Where none but priests are privileged to trade
""In that best marble of which Gods are made;
""They shall have mysteries-- ay precious stuff
""For knaves to thrive by-- mysteries enough;
""Dark, tangled doctrines, dark as fraud can weave,
""Which simple votaries shall on trust receive,
""While craftier feign belief till they believe.
""A Heaven too ye must have, ye lords of dust,--
""A splendid Paradise, --pure souls, ye must:
""That Prophet ill sustains his holy call,
""Who finds not heavens to suit the tastes of all;
""Houris for boys, omniscience for sages,
""And wings and glories for all ranks and ages.
""Vain things! --as lust or vanity inspires,
""The heaven of each is but what each desires,
""And, soul or sense, whate'er the object be,
""Man would be man to all eternity!
""So let him-- EBLIS! grant this crowning curse,
""But keep him what he is, no Hell were worse.""

""Oh my lost soul!"" exclaimed the shuddering maid,
Whose ears had drunk like poison all he said:
MOKANNA started-- not abasht, afraid,--
He knew no more of fear than one who dwells
Beneath the tropics knows of icicles!
But in those dismal words that reached his ear,
""Oh my lost soul!"" there was a sound so drear,
So like that voice among the sinful dead
In which the legend o'er Hell's Gate is read,
That, new as 'twas from her whom naught could dim
Or sink till now, it startled even him.

""Ha, my fair Priestess!"" --thus, with ready wile,
The impostor turned to greet her-- ""thou whose smile
""Hath inspiration in its rosy beam
""Beyond the Enthusiast's hope or Prophet's dream,
""Light of the Faith! who twin'st religion's zeal
""So close with love's, men know not which they feel,
""Nor which to sigh for, in their trance of heart,
""The heaven thou preachest or the heaven thou art!
""What should I be without thee? without thee
""How dull were power, how joyless victory!
""Tho' borne by angels, if that smile of thine
""Blest not my banner 'twere but half divine.
""But-- why so mournful, child? those eyes that shone
""All life last night-- what!-- is their glory gone?
""Come, come-- this morn's fatigue hath made them pale,
""They want rekindling-- suns themselves would fail
""Did not their comets bring, as I to thee,
""From light's own fount supplies of brilliancy.
""Thou seest this cup-- no juice of earth is here,
""But the pure waters of that upper sphere,
""Whose rills o'er ruby beds and topaz flow,
""Catching the gem's bright color as they go.
""Nightly my Genii come and fill these urns--
""Nay, drink-- in every drop life's essence burns;
""'Twill make that soul all fire, those eyes all light--
""Come, come, I want thy loveliest smiles to-night:
""There is a youth-- why start?-- thou saw'st him then;
""Lookt he not nobly? such the godlike men,
""Thou'lt have to woo thee in the bowers above;--
""Tho' he, I fear, hath thoughts too stern for love,
""Too ruled by that cold enemy of bliss
""The world calls virtue-- we must conquer this;
""Nay, shrink not, pretty sage! 'tis not for thee
""To scan the mazes of Heaven's mystery:
""The steel must pass thro' fire, ere it can yield
""Fit instruments for mighty hands to wield.
""This very night I mean to try the art
""Of powerful beauty on that warrior's heart.
""All that my Haram boasts of bloom and wit,
""Of skill and charms, most rare and exquisite,
""Shall tempt the boy; --young MIRZALA'S blue eyes
""Whose sleepy lid like snow on violets lies;
""AROUYA'S cheeks warm as a spring-day sun
""And lips that like the seal of SOLOMON
""Have magic in their pressure; ZEBA'S lute,
""And LILLA'S dancing feet that gleam and shoot
""Rapid and white as sea-birds o'er the deep--
""All shall combine their witching powers to steep
""My convert's spirit in that softening trance,
""From which to heaven is but the next advance;--
""That glowing, yielding fusion of the breast.
""On which Religion stamps her image best.
""But hear me, Priestess! --tho' each nymph of these
""Hath some peculiar, practised power to please,
""Some glance or step which at the mirror tried
""First charms herself, then all the world beside:
""There still wants one to make the victory sure,
""One who in every look joins every lure,
""Thro' whom all beauty's beams concentred pass,
""Dazzling and warm as thro' love's burning glass;
""Whose gentle lips persuade without a word,
""Whose words, even when unmeaning, are adored.
""Like inarticulate breathings from a shrine,
""Which our faith takes for granted are divine!
""Such is the nymph we want, all warmth and light,
""To crown the rich temptations of to-night;
""Such the refined enchantress that must be
""This hero's vanquisher, --and thou art she!""

With her hands claspt, her lips apart and pale,
The maid had stood gazing upon the Veil
From which these words like south winds thro' a fence
Of Kerzrah flowers, came filled with pestilence;
So boldly uttered too! as if all dread
Of frowns from her, of virtuous frowns, were fled,
And the wretch felt assured that once plunged in,
Her woman's soul would know no pause in sin!

At first, tho' mute she listened, like a dream
Seemed all he said: nor could her mind whose beam
As yet was weak penetrate half his scheme.
But when at length he uttered, ""Thou art she!""
All flasht at once and shrieking piteously,
""Oh not for worlds! ""she cried-- ""Great God! to whom
""I once knelt innocent, is this my doom?
""Are all my dreams, my hopes of heavenly bliss,
""My purity, my pride, then come to this,--
""To live, the wanton of a fiend! to be
""The pander of his guilt-- oh infamy!
""And sunk myself as low as hell can steep
""In its hot flood, drag others down as deep!

""Others-- ha! yes-- that youth who came to-day--
""Not him I loved-- not him-- oh! do but say,
""But swear to me this moment 'tis not he,
""And I will serve, dark fiend, will worship even thee!""

""Beware, young raving thing! --in time beware,
""Nor utter what I can not, must not bear,
""Even from thy lips. Go-- try thy lute, thy voice,
""The boy must feel their magic; --I rejoice
""To see those fires, no matter whence they rise,
""Once more illuming my fait Priestess' eyes;
""And should the youth whom soon those eyes shall warm,
""Indeed resemble thy dead lover's form,
""So much the happier wilt thou find thy doom,
""As one warm lover full of life and bloom
""Excels ten thousand cold ones in the tomb.
""Nay, nay, no frowning, sweet! --those eyes were made
""For love, not anger-- I must be obeyed.""

""Obeyed!- -'tis well --yes, I deserve it all--
""On me, on me Heaven's vengeance can not fall
""Too heavily-- but AZIM, brave and true
""And beautiful-- must he be ruined too?
""Must he too, glorious as he is, be driven
""A renegade like me from Love and Heaven?
""Like me? --weak wretch, I wrong him-- not like me;
""No-- he's all truth and strength and purity!
""Fill up your maddening hell-cup to the brim,
""Its witchery, fiends, will have no charm for him.
""Let loose your glowing wantons from their bowers,
""He loves, he loves, and can defy their powers!
""Wretch as I am, in his heart still I reign
""Pure as when first we met, without a stain!
""Tho' ruined-- lost-- my memory like a charm
""Left by the dead still keeps his soul from harm.
""Oh! never let him know how deep the brow
""He kist at parting is dishonored now;--
""Ne'er tell him how debased, how sunk is she.
""Whom once he loved-- once! --still loves dotingly.
""Thou laugh'st, tormentor, --what! --thou it brand my name?
""Do, do-- in vain-- he'll not believe my shame--
""He thinks me true, that naught beneath God's sky
""Could tempt or change me, and-- so once thought I.
""But this is past-- tho' worse than death my lot,
""Than hell-- 'tis nothing while he knows it not.
""Far off to some benighted land I'll fly,
""Where sunbeam ne'er shall enter till I die;
""Where none will ask the lost one whence she came,
""But I may fade and fall without a name.
""And thou-- curst man or fiend, whate'er thou art,
""Who found'st this burning plague-spot in my heart,
""And spread'st it-- oh, so quick!-- thro' soul and frame,
""With more than demon's art, till I became
""A loathsome thing, all pestilence, all flame!--
""If, when I'm gone""--
""Hold, fearless maniac, hold,
""Nor tempt my rage-- by Heaven, not half so bold
""The puny bird that dares with teasing hum
""Within the crocodile's stretched jaws to come!
""And so thou'lt fly, forsooth? --what!-- give up all
""Thy chaste dominion in the Haram Hall,
""Where now to Love and now to ALLA given,
""Half mistress and half saint, thou hang'st as even
""As doth MEDINA'S tomb, 'twixt hell and heaven!
""Thou'lt fly? --as easily may reptiles run,
""The gaunt snake once hath fixt his eyes upon;
""As easily, when caught, the prey may be
""Pluckt from his loving folds, as thou from me.
""No, no, 'tis fixt-- let good or ill betide,
""Thou'rt mine till death, till death MOKANNA'S bride!
""Hast thou forgot thy oath?"" --At this dread word,
The Maid whose spirit his rude taunts had stirred
Thro' all its depths and roused an anger there,
That burst and lightened even thro' her despair--
Shrunk back as if a blight were in the breath
That spoke that word and staggered pale as death.

""Yes, my sworn bride, let others seek in bowers
""Their bridal place-- the charnel vault was ours!
""Instead of scents and balms, for thee and me
""Rose the rich steams of sweet mortality,
""Gay, flickering death-lights shone while we were wed.
""And for our guests a row of goodly Dead,
""(Immortal spirits in their time, no doubt,)
""From reeking shrouds upon the rite looked out!
""That oath thou heard'st more lips than thine repeat--
""That cup-- thou shudderest, Lady,-- was it sweet?
""That cup we pledged, the charnel's choicest wine,
""Hath bound thee-- ay-- body and soul all mine;
""Bound thee by chains that, whether blest or curst
""No matter now, not hell itself shall burst!
""Hence, woman, to the Haram, and look gay,
""Look wild, look-- anything but sad; yet stay--
""One moment more-- from what this night hath past,
""I see thou know'st me, know'st me well at last.
""Ha! ha! and so, fond thing, thou thought'st all true,
""And that I love mankind? --I do, I do--
""As victims, love them; as the sea-dog dotes
""Upon the small, sweet fry that round him floats;
""Or, as the Nile-bird loves the slime that gives
""That rank and venomous food on which she lives!--

""And, now thou seest my soul's angelic hue,
""'Tis time these features were uncurtained too;--
""This brow, whose light-- oh rare celestial light!
""Hath been reserved to bless thy favored sight;
""These dazzling eyes before whose shrouded might
""Thou'st seen immortal Man kneel down and quake--
""Would that they were heaven's lightnings for his sake!
""But turn and look-- then wonder, if thou wilt,
""That I should hate, should take revenge, by guilt,
""Upon the hand whose mischief or whose mirth
""Sent me thus mained and monstrous upon earth;
""And on that race who, tho' more vile they be
""Than moving apes, are demigods to me!
""Here-- judge if hell, with all its power to damn,
""Can add one curse to the foul thing I am!""--
He raised his veil-- the Maid turned slowly round,
Looked at him-- shrieked-- and sunk upon the ground!",Thomas Moore,1961,[90],1

598,More Than I Can Say,"[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
I'm trying to put it all in words, but it's
More than I can say
It would take a whole lifetime to tell you
More than I can say
Every time I wrote a line it’s still
More than I can say
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
More than I can say

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure
The sickness: dreaming of riches
Reality was the cure. My doctor
Physician was music, I'm sure
The prescription was super-model sandwiches
And suicide doors. I used to stand in my mirror
Fixing up my hat right
DMV don't make licenses for the fast life
Was taught never drop my head when I'm doing right
And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights
I just want the whole world to bop their heads
Someone to stop my bread
If my pops was here, he'd be like ""son, you the one
They gotta crown you, a gift from around you
Know they don't understand you, but what can they handle?
If they was wearing Gucci loafers, they'd be through, over
Just stay on point, do what you do
Soldier: remember I'm with you when the world get colder..

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]

[Verse 2 - Nas]
Keep having the same dream
About a mic, a gun, a cross, they all
In the middle of flames
An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain
Hear a voice that asks what do I claim?
I ask what it means. It's sort of a trance
As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands
I could do what I wish with it, and waking up
To study my dreambook, see if it links up
Looking for some significance, like does the dream
Represent this cold world I'm living in?
Ask my man, then his laughter begin
He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun
Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic
The cross, I had it all my life, the same height
I'm trying to sneak sleep, so that my mind won't find out
Time out: my body won't wind down",Nas,1961,"[69, 61, 80, 84, 96]",5
599,Stayin' In,"[Verse 1]
I wasn't taught how to get a job
But I can remember dissecting a frog
I wasn't taught how to pay tax
But I know loads about Shakespeare's classics
I was never taught how to vote
They devoted that time to defining isotopes
I wasn't taught how to look after my health
But mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell

[Verse 2]
Never spent a lesson on current events
Instead I studied The Old American West
I was never taught what laws there are
I was never taught what laws there are
Let me repeat—I was not taught the laws for the country I live in
But I know how Henry the VIII killed his women
Divorced beheaded died, divorced beheaded survived
Glad that's in my head instead of financial advice

[Verse 3]
I was shown the wavelengths of different hues of light
But I was never taught my human rights
Apparently there's thirty, do you know them? I don't
Why the hell can't we both recite them by rote?
I know igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks
Yet I don't know squat about trading stocks
Or how money works at all—where does it come from?
How does the thing that motivates the world function?
Not taught to budget and disperse my earnings
I was too busy there rehearsing cursive
Didn't learn how much it costs to raise a kid or what an affidavit is
But I spent days on what the quadratic equation is:
Negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared
Minus 4ac over 2a
That's insane, that's absolutely insane
They made me learn that over basic first aid

[Verse 4]
Or how to recognize​ the most deadly mental disorders
Or diseases with preventable causes
Or how to buy a house with a mortgage
If I could afford it 'cause abstract maths was deemed more important
Than advice that would literally save thousands of lives
But it's cool, 'cause now I could tell you if the number of unnecessary deaths caused by that choice was prime
Never taught present-day practical medicines
But I was told what the ancient Hippocratic method is
“I've got a headache, the pain is ceaseless
What should I take?”
Um... maybe try some leeches?
“Could we discuss domestic abuse and get the facts
Or how to help my depressed friend with their mental state?”
Um... no, but learn mental maths
Because “you won't have a calculator with you every day!”
They say it's not the kids, the parents are the problem
Then if you taught the kids to parent that's the problem solved then!
All this advice about using a condom
But none for when you actually have a kid when you want one
I'm only fluent in this language, for serious?
The rest of the world speaks two, do you think I'm an idiot?
They chose the solar over the political system
So like a typical citizen now I don't know what I'm voting on
Which policies exist, or how to make them change
Mais oui, je parle un peu de Francais
So at 18, I was expected to elect a representative
For a system I had never ever ever been presented with

[Chorus]
But I won't take it
I'll tell everyone my childhood was wasted
I'll share it everywhere how I was “educated”
And insist these pointless things don't stay in school",Boyinaband,1961,"[79, 49, 33, 34, 38, 45, 69]",7

601,"Top Forty, News, Weather And Sports","Twelve or thirteen miles from Souillac the main line from Brives to Cahors, which flanks the slope, describes a rather sharp curve. The journey is a particularly picturesque one, and travellers who make it during the daytime have much that is interesting and agreeable to see; but while they are admiring the country, which marks the transition from the severe region of the Limousin to the more laughing landscapes on the confines of the Midi, the train suddenly plunges into a tunnel which runs for half a mile and more through the heart of the mountain slope. Leaving the tunnel, the line continues along the slope, then gradually descends towards Souillac. Two or three miles from that little station, which is a junction, the line runs alongside the highroad to Salignac, skirts for a brief distance the Corrèze, one of the largest tributaries on the right bank of the Dordogne, and then plunges into the heart of Lot.

Torrential winter rains had seriously affected the railway embankment, particularly near the mouth of the tunnel; a succession of heavy storms in the early part of December had so greatly weakened the ballast that the chief engineers of the Company had been hastily summoned to the scene of the mischief. The experts decided that very important repairs were required close to the Souillac end of the tunnel. It was necessary to put in a complete system of drainage, with underground pipes through which the water that came down from the mountain could escape between the ballast and the side of the rock and so pass underneath the permanent way. The sleepers, too, had been loosened by the bad weather, and some of them had perished so much that the chairs were no longer fast, a matter which was all the more serious because the line described a very sharp curve at that precise spot.

Gangs of first-class navvies had been hurriedly requisitioned, but in spite of the fact that an exceptional rate of wages was paid, a local strike had broken out and for some days all work was stopped. Gradually, however, moderate counsels prevailed and for over a week now, nearly all the men had taken up their tools again. Nevertheless, for a month past, these various circumstances had resulted in all the trains running between Brives and Cahors, being regularly half an hour late. Further, in view of the dangerous state of the line, all engine drivers coming from Brives had received orders to stop their trains two hundred yards from the end of the tunnel, and all drivers coming from Cahors to stop their trains five hundred yards before the entrance to the tunnel, so that should a train appear while any work was going on which rendered it dangerous to pass, it could wait until the work was completed. The order was also issued with the primary object of preventing the workers on the line from being taken by surprise.

Day was just breaking this grey December morning, when the gang of navvies set to work under a foreman, fixing on the down line the new sleepers which had been brought up the day before. Suddenly a shrill whistle was heard, and in the gaping black mouth of the tunnel the light of two lamps became visible; a train bound for Cahors had stopped in accordance with orders, and was calling for permission to pass.

The foreman ranged his men on either side of the down line and walked to a small cabin erected at the mouth of the tunnel, where he pulled the hand-signal so as to show the green light, thereby authorising the train to proceed on its way.

There was a second short, sharp whistle; heavy puffs escaped from the engine, and belching forth a dense volume of black smoke it slowly emerged from the tunnel, followed by a long train of carriages, the windows of which were frosted all over by the cold temperature outside.

A man approached the cabin allotted to the plate-layer in charge of that section of the line in which the tunnel was included.

""I suppose this is the train due at Verrières at 6.55?"" he said carelessly.

""Yes,"" the plate-layer answered, ""but it's late, for the clock down there in the valley struck seven several minutes ago.""

The train had gone by: the three red lamps fastened at the end of it were already lost in the morning mist.

The man who spoke to the plate-layer was no other than François Paul, the tramp who had been discharged by the magistrate installed at the château of Beaulieu, at precisely the same time the day before, after a brief examination. In spite of the deep wrinkle furrowed in his brow the man seemed to make an effort to appear friendly and to want to carry on the conversation.

""There aren't many people in this morning train,"" he remarked, ""specially in the first-class carriages.""

The plate-layer appeared in no wise unwilling to postpone for a few moments his tiring and chilly underground patrol; he put down his pick before answering.

""Well, that's not surprising, is it? People who are rich enough to travel first-class always come by the express which gets to Brives at 2.50 a.m.""

""I see,"" said François Paul; ""that's reasonable: and more practical for travellers to Brives or Cahors. But what about the people who want to get out at Gourdon, or Souillac, or Verrières, or any of the small stations where the express doesn't stop?""

""I don't know,"" said the plate-layer; ""but I suppose they have to get out at Brives or Cahors and drive, or else travel by the day trains, which are fast to Brives and slow afterwards.""

François Paul did not press the matter. He lit a pipe and breathed upon his benumbed fingers.

""Hard times, these, and no mistake!""

The plate-layer seemed sorry for him.

""I don't suppose you're an independent gentleman, but why don't you try to get taken on here?"" he suggested. ""They want hands here.""

""Oh, do they?""

""That's the fact; this is the foreman coming along now: would you like me to speak to him for you?""

""No hurry,"" replied François Paul. ""'Course, I'm not saying no, but I should like to see what sort of work it is they're doing here: it might not suit me; I shall still have time to get a couple of words with him,"" and with his eyes on the ground the tramp slowly walked along the embankment away from the plate-layer.

The foreman met and passed him, and came up to the plate-layer at the mouth of the tunnel.

""Well, Michu, how goes it with you? Still got the old complaint?""

""Middling, boss,"" the worthy fellow answered: ""just keeping up, you know. And how's yourself? And the work? When shall you finish? I don't know if you know it, but these trains stopping regularly in my section give me an extra lot of work.""

""How's that?"" the foreman enquired in surprise.

""The engine drivers take advantage of the stop to empty their ash-pans, and they leave a great heap of mess there in my tunnel, which I'm obliged to clear away. In the ordinary way they dump it somewhere else: where, I don't know, but not in my tunnel, and that's all I care about.""

The foreman laughed.

""You're a good 'un, Michu! If I were you I would ask the Company to give me another man or two.""

""And do you suppose the Company would?"" Michu retorted. ""By the way, that poor devil who is going along there, shivering with cold and hunger, was grumbling to me just now, and I advised him to ask you to take him on. What do you think he said? Why, that he would have a look at the work first, and off he went.""

""It's a fact, Michu, that it's mighty difficult to come across people who mean business nowadays. It's quite true that I want more hands. But if that chap doesn't ask me to engage him in another minute, I'll kick him out. The embankment is not public property, and I don't trust these rascals who are for ever coming and going among the workmen to see what mischief they can make. I'll go and cast an eye over the bolts and things, for there are all sorts of vagrants about the neighbourhood just now.""

""And criminals, too,"" said old Michu. ""I suppose you have heard of the murder up at the château of Beaulieu?""

""Rather! My men are talking of nothing else. But you are right, Michu, I will get a closer look at all strangers, and at your friend in particular.""

The foreman stopped abruptly; he had been examining the foot of the embankment, and was standing quite still, watching. The plate-layer followed his glance, and also stood fixed. After a few moments' silence the two men looked at each other and smiled. In the half-light of the valley they had seen the outline of a gendarme; he was on foot and appeared to be looking for somebody, while making no attempt to remain unseen himself.

""Good!"" whispered Michu; ""that's sergeant Doucet: I know him by his stripes. They say the murder was not committed by anyone belonging to this part of the country; everybody was fond of the Marquise de Langrune.""

""Look! Look!"" the foreman broke in, pointing to the gendarme who was slowly climbing up the embankment. ""It looks as if the sergeant were making for the gentleman who was looking for work just now and hoped he would not find it. The sergeant's got a word for him, eh, what?""

""That might be,"" said Michu after a moment's further watching. ""That chap has a villainous, ugly face. One can tell from the way he's dressed that he don't belong to our parts.""

The two men waited with utmost interest to see what was going to happen.

Sergeant Doucet reached the top of the embankment at last and hurried past the navvies, who stopped their work to stare inquisitively after the representative of authority. Fifty yards beyond them, François Paul, wrapped in thought, was walking slowly down towards the station of Verrières. Hearing the sound of steps behind him, he turned. When he saw the sergeant he frowned. He glanced rapidly about him and saw that while he was alone with the gendarme, so that no one could overhear what they said, however loudly they might speak, they were yet in such a position that every sign and movement they made would be perfectly visible to whoever might watch them. And as the gendarme paused a few paces from him and—remarkable fact—seemed to be on the point of bringing his hand to his cap in salute, the mysterious tramp rapped out:

""I thought I said no one was to disturb me, sergeant?""

The sergeant took a pace forward.

""I beg your pardon, Inspector, but I have important news for you.""

For this François Paul, whom the sergeant thus respectfully addressed as Inspector, was no other than an officer of the secret police who had been sent down to Beaulieu the day before from head-quarters in Paris.

He was no ordinary officer. As if M. Havard had had an idea that the Langrune affair would prove to be puzzling and complicated, he had singled out the very best of his detectives, the most expert inspector of them all—Juve. It was Juve who for the last forty-eight hours had been prowling about the château of Beaulieu disguised as a tramp, and had had himself arrested with Bouzille that he might prosecute his own investigations without raising the slightest suspicion as to his real identity.

Juve made a face expressive of his vexation at the over-deferential attitude of the sergeant.

""Do pay attention!"" he said low. ""We are being watched. If I must go back with you, pretend to arrest me. Slip the handcuffs on me!""

""I beg your pardon, Inspector: I don't like to,"" the gendarme answered.

For all reply, Juve turned his back on him.

""Look here,"" he said, ""I will take a step or two forward as if I meant to run away; then you must put your hand on my shoulder roughly, and I will stumble; when I do, slip the bracelets on.""

From the mouth of the tunnel the plate-layer, the foreman and the navvies all followed with their eyes the unintelligible conversation passing between the gendarme and the tramp a hundred yards away. Suddenly they saw the man try to get off and the sergeant seize him almost simultaneously. A few minutes later the individual, with his hands linked together in front of him, was obediently descending the steep slope of the embankment, by the gendarme's side, and then the two men disappeared behind a clump of trees.

""I understand why that chap was not very keen on getting taken on here,"" said the foreman. ""His conscience was none too easy!""

As they walked briskly in the direction of Beaulieu Juve asked the sergeant:

""What has happened at the château, then?""

""They know who the murderer is, Inspector,"" the sergeant answered. ""Little Mlle. Thérèse——""",Marcel Allain & Pierre Souvestre,1961,"[99, 85, 81, 94, 90, 99]",6

Chamber 9's perfection, constitute we movin in son
Shark style, peep the fin, pushin through like
Stiff arm Heisman, although we wise men
Don't make us act a fool, keep a calm, cool collective
A nice perspective, it only takes for one cat to disrespect his
Or ruin a show, oh what y'all ain't know
That everything's real like blue steel
Bein pulled out at a sold out concert?
The crowd went berzerk, here come the Jakes, red alert
They got trampled on, a cop lost one arm
Killarm' still live on stage don ""Red Dawn""
Eh-yo, where ""The Obsticle""? Anything's possible
""Allah Sees Everything"", kid, check the obsticle
Beretta did his verse in the crowd, this kid's remarkable
9th punched a cat in the face, call the hospital
911 style, ShoGun cracked a smile
Or push this cat into Sin, through in the towel
It's like life's insane, Dom P pop champagne
And Is' came out of the crowd with 20 chains

[Islord]
Nonchalantly, I roll up on the rap scene bluntly
Still hittin fiends off monthly
Cuz this rap shit ain't feedin me
My physical is just lookin real good but my insides is cryin
Fiendin to catch like fifty analog niggas off point
And tear pockets, so stay still, tell ya crew
Don't even move, cuz I got like fifty-five keepin it live
Tight niggas trapped with rockets, pointed at ya eye sockets
Throwin ninety-nine joints at ya grill, you can't block it

[P.R. Terrorist]
Rebellious one, who never like to carry small guns
I like 'em big, bulky and shit, designed for ya wig
And any pig that try and confront me and my cig'
That bomb is rigged, ready to explode, get blown to Madrid
You and ya fam, you and ya mans and all of your kids
Because I'm nuts, spillin my guts like dry heavin
A fly even, cat that never split his pie even
Get caught in my life of fire and die weezin
And the man who seen it go down for no apparent reason
Just breathin and believin that it's pockets that I be greasin
He's deceived and relieved with dollar sign eyes gleamin
War ringin, diva bitch in my bed, she's soul singin
With my mic, suckin it right, my son's outside slingin
Beige snowballs, snot drip from his nose, eatin a Halls
I got a show, later tonight, I'm headed to the mall
I'll grab you somethin, if you see Fantasia tell her she frontin
Cuz I had her way in my lab and didn't fuck nothin
Life's somethin, somedays I be feelin like snipin somethin
Writin somethin that'll change the whole world, feel like I'm comin
With this black ink all over these white sheets
Run like a track meet with a fleet
Of killas and shit, don't even compete {*pause*}
Yo..
In a herd of white wool, label the black sheep
Tap dancin on fire, the kid with bronze feet
Terrorist snatchin the track, leavin the gold teeth
All you playas, killas, dogs, thugs - make it brief

Wish that I were holding Jimmy's girl

I'm in love with Jimmy's girl though I've never met her
Still I can't forget her Jimmy's girl

Jimmy's always telling me that her hair is golden
Wish that I were holdin' Jimmy's girl
He says her lips are warm each time they kiss good night
And just as sweet as any lips can be
And then I close my eyes and though it's make believe
I pretend she's in love with me

How I long for Jimmy's girl but her love is taken
So my heart is breakin' for Jimmy's girl
When I close my eyes although it's make believe
I pretend she's in love with me

609,All In My Mind,"[Verse 1: Thorough]
They told me to come clever, whatever
It dont make, it's on you
So I be who I be, and do what I gotta do
I'm one of the few, the proud and the pimpest
In this business I be the swiftest when I kick this
As if you didn't know it's Thorough from that Suave Camp
Best Vemp chimped, or get licked like a mail stamp
Amps and beats, technics is what I come with
Gangsta's and pimps and balla's is who I fuck with...

[Verse 2: Mr. Mike]
FUCK nobody safe when I see demons in tha mirror
Wicked as fuck feeling like a Murder & Killa
Witness I'm on the defense like Johnny Cochran
NOW GIVE UP YO THANGS MISTA, before this Glock hit the proper spot
Blocks on phones, they won't leave they homes, peeping through cracks
Cause blacks be coming back with all that past crap
Strap on your bullit proof vest and combat boots
It's NIGGA NIGGA DAY!!
And this time we go come on you
Baby blue disguise thats wise
Made me loose my 9-5 got myself a 4-5 im
Aimless spraying not playing with their vertabrates
These the Murda Dayz
So many niggas must come wicked
We done heard of wayz........

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
I see one, two, Niggas actin live
3 seconds past before I blast with my 4-5
6 shots, 7 cops, just to take 8ball
9 witnesses reported all the shit the recalled
Everlasting, blasting, niggas running fast when
Buckin gott'em ducking
Putting sucka's in the past tense
I be the holder of the gat therefore it shall not run
A psychic couldn't see such a feature for my momma's son
(Nigga) Breath taker, the overweight trouble maker
Fake trick breaker, Tennessee earthquaker
Shaking grounds when I'm walking smoking fat onion
I get lit, and beat the shit out of Paul Bunyon
Fightin, Clash of the Titans on your dial
I'm gettin blitzed stickin on medusa doggystyle
Word G, you heard me
The wicked bitch served
Now I'm playing soccer, gotta kick'em to da curb G
But she's not with it, put a spell on the fat mack
I hate stikin ho's but I can't help but to go back
I sound like a fiend, everytime is the last time
Could this be reality or all in my mind?......

[Verse 4: Mr. Mike]
Spill 9's like fluid, do it like some G's
They know me from Columbian streets to Portugeese
(nigga how u figga)
I got mo scratch than flea's
I got mo gat's than these
High powered sour nigga's
Steady slangin crack to fiend's
At ease, take a look at some black G's
Scopin the president, takin over residents like black kings
Stack G's with phat key's
Rats ease on your properties poppin me for my black jeans

[Verse 5: Thorough]
I had a cracker on my scope and my finger still itchin
Visions of killing and then the strap start spittin, hittin
The prez, plottin payback on the devil
A rebel and a mason is what yall snakes facing
Chasing traders with my data cause I hata should be corpe
And peep game when it's being taught, or to picture this of us lyricists
Seeing nigga'z taking shots and the same nigga'z getting hit
Spit the gift and got fam like Gotti
Hittin her like hobbies
Killin everybody
Let my head grip the bed and I check the time
It's all a dream, I seen in my fuckin mind.....

280 pounds of hay, every damn day I gotta test a
25 lighters on my dresser , yessir
Breakfast being served by a ho that look like Genie
She press my every wish and keeps a tight ass bikini tini
Tiny as a Barbie Doll summer set
She all up in my house and I still ain't hit that pussy yet
I gives props to my butler, cause he know
That I know on the downlow he's a chiefin muthafucka for ya
Now as I flips through the calendar I spots the winter
If it ain't 3 mo freaky hoes wanna have dinner
But I can't do it cause my schedule just to tight
I just phoned, Quincy Jones said he needs my help tonight
He wanted me to pick the strong from the wimps
Them playa's with the limps to make a song called We Are The Pimps
I call's Ball, Ball calls the crew
We met up at the Penthouse, and Paris Round 2

The elevated train by my window
Doesn’t faze me anymore
The rattling screams don’t disrupt my dreams
It’s a lullaby, in its way
The elevated train drives everyone insane
But I don’t mind, oh no
When I bring back boys they can’t tolerate the noise
And that’s okay, 'cause I never let them stay
And one day, I’m hoppin’ that elevated train and I’m riding away!
It won’t be long now!

The boys around the way holler at me when I’m walking down the street
Their machismo pride doesn’t break my stride—
It’s a compliment, so they say
The boys around the way holler at me every day but I don’t mind, oh no
If I’m in the mood, it will not be with some dude
Who is whistling 'cause he has nothing to say
Or who’s honking at me from his Chevrolet!
And one day… I’m hoppin’ in a limousine and I’m driving away!

I get so lonesome for you
That I don't know what to do

Well, you told me
You would leave me
You told me
You would go away

Ah, you told me
You would need me
Told me
You would go away

I told you
You were lying
And I don't believe
A word you say

You told me you would leave me
I told you you could go
I told you a lot
Because I love you so

Early every morning
Early every evening too
Early every morning
Early every evening too
I get so lonesome for you

You told me you would leave me

That I don't know what to do",Dinah Washington,1961,[95],1
623,I Lied To My Heart,"I told my heart I didn't love you
That I'd be happy if we'd part
But now I know I was mistaken
I told a lie to my heart

I told my heart I didn't love you
Now we'll forever be apart
Lonely years of tears and sorrow
I told a lie to my heart

If we sin somehow we pay
And now the bitter teardrops start
I must learn to live without you
I told a lie to my heart

That I'd be happy if we'd part

I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So till the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't no one

Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one

Que tú estabas hablando conmigo
Porque si fantasmea se muere

Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chingas conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
Que no te esté llamando (no), dile que lo estoy buscando

(Bryant Myers)
Siempre volvemo' a verno'
Tú pegándole cuerno'
Chingábamos to'a las veces que te dejaba sola
En las noches de invierno
Me cura cuando me enfermo
Pero tenemos que esconderno'
Yo quiero que tú me bailes como bailan
To'as las putas en el infierno, ah
Entro a la cabaña
Tú quieres champaña
Terminamos de hacerlo y me pide chingar
Otra vez cada vez que se baña
Una santa con él y conmigo se daña
Yo sé que to'as las cadenas él las baña
Dile a ese cabrón que tumbe la actitud
Y que deje las miradas extrañas

[Verso 2: Almighty]
(Almighty)
Siempre estoy online en WhatsApp
Esperando que un culo me escriba
Ella tiene un canal de YouTube
Modelando las nalgas pa' que me suscriba
Echamos tres polvos como las tres líneas de la combi Adidas
No quiere amarrarse (no)
Pero chicha conmigo y mañana se olvida, baby (wuh)
Tu marido anda a pie
Por eso me llama y me pide una ride
Enrola que tengo una moña más verde
Que Linterna Verde y botellas de Sprite
A tu jevo le pongo un checkmark en la cara
Con la 23 le hago el signo de Nike
Tengo a las putas de ustedes
Metidas en Instagram dándome like
Pónme el condón con la boca
Es má', no me lo pongas ya (no quiero)
Me dice que no me da el culo
Si no es en hoteles o en el Gran Meliá (cabrona)
Tengo muchas prepago'
Tengo chapiadoras que maman por trago
Y yo que les compro botellas
Imagínate, mi herma, to' lo que les hago (Almighty)

Que esta noche ella está dispuesta a pegarle cuernos al marío'
Y me digo en la cara del bobo 'e tu esposo
Si yo me lo encuentro
""Lo bueno de estar con mujeres casadas
Es que yo me les vengo adentro""
Me he chingado a modelos cabronas, pero sigo discreto
No me gusta decir quiénes son
Pero dando candela, saben, no es secreto
Con muchas mujeres hermosas siempre me han vinculado
Maripily, Caroline Aquino, Vilmarie Mojica, Bebé Maldonado
Me he tirado a cinco Miss Universe porque estoy en la mía
Y hasta he puesto a mujeres famosas
A chuparse, lamberse y hasta a hacer orgías
Me le vengo en la boca, se pasa mi leche
Y me mira con cara 'e bellaca
La mando a Colombia, se hace las tetas
Yo soy el que leche le saca

628,Angel Baby,"[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I was young when she told me I was divine, yes
Not even nine yet (Tech N9ne)
Ran away then got into a life of crime next, pyrex
Made it through the
Close calls, even I evaded shooters
So if anything go crazy
Everything works for the angel, baby

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
My first and for sure brush
With death was on the school bus, danger almost made my stool gush
Because the substitute driver caused the truck to cruise by us
Would've been crushed in dude's tires 'cause this fool's nuts
Sun shining, 'bout to have a more dark day
Told 'em drop me off on 63rd and Swope Parkway
That ain't my regular stop, but I can leg it for blocks
To my grandmother's
""Will do"" the old fucks' say
And what's a little strange
He didn't pull to the curb but he attempted to let me off in the middle lane
And the bus stairway extended my right leg
Then a truck flew by
If I woulda stepped sooner then I'd be quite dead

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]
Walked right out that fire while death was knocking at my door
Angel baby, angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby
Praying that my angel's watching over me
Keeping me safe 'til I get home
Angel baby, angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
At my homie, Davie, house tripping, shrooms
Dark rainy night but on a mission, soon
It was me, Davie, Grant, Jake, and a bitch
To get some more, we gonna be dipping, vroom
Jumped in her car
Hit the highway doing 65, hey thinking ""This is my day""
She speeding, we tweaking, slick from sky spray
Hit a bump on the bridge, and the shit went sideways
Left, then right, then left again
To a girl with Tech and friends, this is where death begins
Hit the wall on the bridge hard, stopped in a quick sec
A little faster, we woulda flipped over and fell to our death

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]
Walked right out that fire while death was knocking at my door
Angel baby, angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby
Praying that my angel's watching over me
Keeping me safe 'til I get home
Angel baby, angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Southwest High School nighttime
Martin Luther King Day talent show, flight climb
To another level, takes the Devil to incite crime
No bright minds, ain't no telling what you might find
Whole lotta gang shit
Somebody wanna bang with the homies I came with
6512 one a road was dangerous
Some lames couldn't hang 'cause I gang thick
That's when I saw one of 'em pull a pistol on us and aimed it
I was in the wind, just like the bullets that whizzed by
Running for blocks in the night, but never did die
Things go shaky and I'm sane more lately
But I guess mama protected me naming me angel baby
Thank you mama

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]
Walked right out that fire while death was knocking at my door
Angel baby, angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby
Praying that my angel's watching over me

Everything works for the angel baby

Everything works for the angel baby
Everything works for the angel baby

629,My Empty Arms,"I'm catching on to all the symptoms that you feign
Another shot of something, warm to numb the pain
Lets just be honest and admit we can't go on
You can begin to be yourself once I am gone

Your kiss was sweet like an apricot
I guess I'm the girl you thought
When you said this would never be undone
Your heart was pure like youth and all it's charms
Now my empty arms are of no use
To me or anyone

I always knew that you deserved much more than me
You are more interesting than I'll ever be
Somehow our whole world has gone spinning in reverse
I hope this heartache of mine won't get any worse

Your kiss was sweet like an apricot
I guess I'm the girl you thought
When you said this would never be undone
Your heart was pure like youth and all it's charms
Now my empty arms are of no use
To me or anyone

Will you forget the scent of violets on my skin

And darlin'
When I heard
That final, crushing word
That someone else's arms would hold you tight.,
I wished that I was dead

Oh Lord
You konow I shed
The tear of the year
Last night

I built my whole world around you
By each and every dream
And now you're slipping
Through my fingers
Like the ripples
In a stream

Oh!
Oh darlin'
You can say
Our love has seen it's day
But I'll forever go on feelin' blue

I feel the hurt inside
I felt the night I cried

631,Cherié,"[Vers 1: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Hej du, jag har väntat på dig
Och jag har stått vid blåa linjen när de väntar på dig
Den här perrongen har byggts om och alla väggar målats om
Men jag är hemma i betong, så jag har väntat på dig
Men det är många flera som sitter här
En gammal man berättar att han en gång kysst sin första kärlek här vid trappan där
Som sen blev hans fru, och de två skaffade barn
Sen hon gick bort har han nu kommit hit nu varje dag
Och vid bänkarna så sitter någon annan kvinna
Hon kunde aldrig hitta kärlek så hon sitter stilla
Där är min pappa står och köper något ur automaten
Och ångrar att han inte jobbat mindre och varit mer med barnen
Varför är jag på perrongen där vårt tåg har gått?
Här sitter bara folk som levt med att de har saknat något
Och där är du igen, du står i öppningen och håller i den biljett jag rev för längesen

[Refräng: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie
Jag vet ingenting om någonting förutom att jag vill vara din
Ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie
Jag vet ingenting om någonting förutom att jag vill vara din

[Vers 2: Dante Lindhe]
Det står ""svindlare"" i passet på mitt efternamn
Jag har en cigg nu bakom örat och en flaska i min högra hand
Men min vänstra, den är fri ikväll
Så jag kan hålla i din hand om det blir vi igen
Jag har stått här på perrongen, bett dem vänta, hålla tåget
Konduktörer har slängt av mig när jag har sagt till dem du kommer
Och alla tuggarna som stått här till fem
Jag har berättat om dig, de vill alla träffa dig sen
Har gått vidare så många gånger, har varit där
Men lika många gånger har jag vart tillbaks här igen
Nästan glömt hur du ser ut, hur du låter, hur du rör dig
Överröstar rösten på perrongen, hoppats att du hör mig
Så när allting kommit kring har jag stannat för din skull
Blivit bästa vän med pundarna som trillar omkull
Livet på perrongen var ett äventyr
Så om jag aldrig får dig, så fick jag någonting

[Refräng: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie
Jag vet ingenting om någonting förutom att jag vill vara din
Ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie
Jag vet ingenting om någonting förutom att jag vill vara din

[Vers 3: Noel Flike]
Hon sa, ""Inte som vi nånsin blir föräldrar""
Men tror vi blir en spegelbild av de som vi fick själva
Vackra sluten tillhör sagor, tillhör vi någonting som lämnats?
I en gammal stenfasad där varje bit aldrig kan ändras?
Och kanske är vi parallella linjer
Menade att följa varann resten av livet
Men kommer ta en evighet för oss att kollidera
Men bara om jag snuddar dig blir allting komplicerat
För varje hållplats i mitt liv är en bit ifrån dig
Så många hoppar på och hoppar av stationen senare
Ödet säger, ""Fortsätt spring"", hjärtat säger, ""Vänd dig om""
Skymtar dig i en sekund vid varenda grå perrong
Och du är röda linjen som jag saknat
Jag har varit trasig men allting går väl att laga
När vi blir gamla ska jag hitta dig igen
Och rosta bort i evighet som ingenting hänt

[Refräng: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie
Jag vet ingenting om någonting förutom att jag vill vara din
Ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie
Jag vet ingenting om någonting förutom att jag vill vara din
(Hey)

[Stick: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Hej min vän, säg, vart har du varit?
Det blev tyst när du försvann
Jag är kvar och allt är som vanligt
Ingen annan tog din plats

[Outro: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie
Jag kan inte prata franska men det låter väl ändå fint
Och ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie, ma chérie
Jag vet ingenting om någonting förutom att jag vill vara din",Hov1,1961,"[59, 54, 57, 97]",4
632,(Ghost) Riders In The Sky,"[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 1]
An old cowpoke went ridin' out
One dark and windy day (yippie-I-ay)
Upon a ridge he rested
As he went along his way
When all at once a mighty bunch
Of red eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 2]
Their brands were still on fire
And their hoofs were made of steel (yippie-I-ay)
Their horns were black and shiny
And the hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
As they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders commin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 3]
Their faces gaunt
Their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat (yippie-I-ay)
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd
But they ain't caught 'em yet'
'Cause you've gotta ride forever
On that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on, hear their cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 4]
As the riders went on by him
He heard one call his name (yippie-I-ay)
If you want to save your soul
From ever ridin' on our range
Then cowboy change your way today
Or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd
Across the endless skies

Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o

Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song

He'd ride across the Rio Grande
Every night
He'd risk his life to hold her hand
For he knew her father swore to take the life
Of the cowboy who would make Marie his wife

It was never meant to be
Still they kissed so tenderly
And they vowed their love
Would never, ever die

As her held her, oh, so tight
The sound of gunfire filled the night
The lovers sighed and then
They kissed their last goodbye

You will find two tombstones on the desert sand
And they tell the story of so long ago

640,Rubber Ball,"[Verse 1]
Rolling around like a big rubber ball
Writing this song about some things that I saw
Trying to stand like a big strong tough man
Finding out fast that I'm sinking in sand

[Chorus 1]
All I got is nothing but
A little bit of love and gonna
Give it to the people then they'll see
And then they'll see

Spinning the tops as the tables they turn
Made some mistakes but I still couldn't learn
Covered my tracks, thought I was fine
Got No self control, now I'm back here in line

All I got is nothing but
A little bit of love and gonna
Give it to the people then they'll see

641,Once In Awhile,"[Verse 1]
I thought I would know better
That's wishful thinking
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinking
Is anything forever, or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?
I don't know

[Verse 2]
From Brooklyn to New York, then off to the West
In Cali, no Khaled, but we the best
My stripes, stay American, let me express
And I keep it as live as a Total Request
And they ask me these questions
Like, ""How do you do it?
Press and the road and the music""
Truth is, I'm always up, I'm always down
Worry 'bout everyone else

[Chorus]
But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, yeah, I feel good
I feel good (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good

[Verse 3]
I live life like my blood type, B positive
These days, something got me feeling quite the opposite
Music like my heroin, but I all I hear is poppy hits
Time to get up off of it and watch somebody copy it
I'm West bound down and out
Feeling fake now like somebody found me out
Need to slow down, I'm browning out
So many thoughts, let me drown 'em out

[Verse 1]
I thought I would know better
That's wishful thinking
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinking
Is anything forever, or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?
I don't know

[Chorus]
But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good

[Verse 4]
I've been looking at where we're going
There's no slowing down to go back
And thinking of where we've been
No one's ever been given a road map
Say, ""slow down, turn here, graduate and work here
Come and get a raise when you finish up your first year""
No, if you're doing it, you're doing it right
Keep it moving, now, tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause sometimes we're up, sometimes we're down
Don't worry about anyone else

[Chorus]
But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, yeah, I feel good
I feel good, (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good
I just wanna dance

645,Are You Lonesome To-night?,"[Verse 1]
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Spoken:
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each of us must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to changed, you acted strange
And why I've never know
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain

What would I do
If I had not met you?
Who would I blame my life on?
Once I was told
That all men get what they deserve
Who the hell then threw this curve?
There are no answers
But who would I be
If you had not been my friend?

You're the only one
One out of a thousand others
Only one my child would allow
When I'm having fun
You're the one I wanna talk to
Where have you been?
Where are you now?

Who would I be
If I had not loved you?
How would I know what love is?
God only knows, too soon
I'll remember your faults
Meanwhile, though, it's tears and schmaltz

There are no answers
But what would I do
If you had not been my friend?

WHIZZER
All your life you've wanted men
And when you got it up to have them
Who knew it could end your life?

I left my kid and left my wife
To be with you
To be insulted by such handsome men

WHIZZER
Do you regret--?

MARVIN
I'd do it again
I'd like to believe that I'd do it again
And again and again...
And
What more can I say?

WHIZZER
What more can I say?

MARVIN
How am I to face tomorrow?

BOTH
After being screwed out of today
Tell me what's in store

Yes, I'd beg or steal or borrow
If I could hold you for
One hour more

One hour more

That good men get better with age

If you hadn't been my friend?

But what would I do...

My friend?

655,Battle Of Gettysburg,"    July 4th.—The weather to-day, upon the whole, is very fine, warm, but from a smart rain last night, fresh enough, and no dust, which is a great relief for this city. I saw the parade about noon, Pennsylvania avenue, from Fifteenth street down toward the capitol. There were three regiments of infantry, (I suppose the ones doing patrol duty here,) two or three societies of Odd Fellows, a lot of children in barouches, and a squad of policemen. (A useless imposition upon the soldiers—they have work enough on their backs without piling the like of this.)

    As I went down the Avenue, saw a big flaring placard on the bulletin board of a newspaper office, announcing ""Glorious Victory for the Union Army!"" Meade had fought Lee at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, yesterday and day before, and repuls'd him most signally, taken 3,000 prisoners, &c. (I afterwards saw Meade's despatch, very modest, and a sort of order of the day from the President himself, quite religious, giving thanks to the Supreme, and calling on the people to do the same.)

    I walk'd on to Armory hospital—took along with me several bottles of blackberry and cherry syrup, good and strong, but innocent. Went through several of the wards, announc'd to the soldiers the news from Meade, and gave them all a good drink of the syrups with ice water, quite refreshing—prepar'd it all myself, and serv'd it around. Meanwhile the Washington bells are ringing their sun-down peals for Fourth of July, and the usual fusilades of boys' pistols, crackers, and guns.",Walt Whitman,1961,[100],1

North to Alaska - go north, the rush is on

With George Pratt his partner, and brother Billy too

He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow

George turned to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said ""Sam you're a-lookin' at a lonely, lonely man

For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand

'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember, Sam, a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain just a little southeast of Nome""

Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more I'll share

I was wrong should have known
Took me home on our last date

I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly destiny misery
Tragedy on our last date

Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my baby's eye
Walked away didn't know that
I'd soon miss him so
Guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldn't see
How much he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be

The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find

Remember the old days when I met you. I never thought I would get you
Remember the good times we shared together, and now they're just a song
Remember the first time that I saw you. Remember the first time that I taught you
Remember the old friends we knew together, and how they've all gone on

Well we danced by the light of the moon. The band kept on playing that tune
You asked me to carry you home, we were alone
And then I saw moonlight dance in your hair. Now I'll never, never, never see it again
No I'll never, ever, ever have it again. It's gone, just like the song that lives on

Doesn't it seem like the right time. I wanna go way back through my lifetime
Gotta go way back and re-live those days, when everything was mine
Doesn't it seem like a long ways. Back through the fog and the byways
Doesn't it seem strange it took so long, but I saw it all today

The moon through the trees did go down. The snowflakes had covered the ground
Morning left moonlight behind; day was unkind
But then I saw lovelight dance in your hair. Ah I'll never, never, never see it again
I'll never, ever, ever have it again. Oh no, just the snow and I know",Seals And Crofts,1961,"[94, 52, 56, 84, 82, 50, 47]",7

668,"Don't Believe Him, Donna","[Intro]
And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that! (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (""Hi, Bob!"")
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark
And fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, ""Knock it off!""
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any—it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders
Hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids say no to drugs (Smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm…)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dump (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Outro]
Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)

672,Main Theme from Exodus (Ari's Theme),"Chapter 1

THE OFFICE OF THE WISE MAN

“My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate impiety” (Prov. 8:7).

[1] The usage of the multitude, which according to the Philosopher is to be followed in giving names to things, has commonly held that they are to be called wise who order things rightly and govern them well. Hence, among other things that men have conceived about the wise man, the Philosopher includes the notion that “it belongs to the wise man to order.” Now, the rule of government and order for all things directed to an end must be taken from the end. For, since the end of each thing is its good, a thing is then best disposed when it is fittingly ordered to its end. And so we see among the arts that one functions as the governor and the ruler of another because it controls its end. Thus, the art of medicine rules and orders the art of the chemist because health, with which medicine is concerned, is the end of all the medications prepared by the art of the chemist. A similar situation obtains in the art of ship navigation in relation to shipbuilding, and in the military art with respect to the equestrian art and the equipment of war. The arts that rule other arts are called architectonic, as being the ruling arts. That is why the artisans devoted to these arts, who are called master artisans, appropriate to themselves the name of wise men. But, since these artisans are concerned, in each case, with the ends of certain particular things, they do not reach to the universal end of all things. They are therefore said to be wise with respect to this or that thing; in which sense it is said that “as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation” (1 Cor. 3:10). The name of the absolutely wise man, however, is reserved for him whose consideration is directed to the end of the universe, which is also the origin of the universe. That is why, according to the Philosopher, it belongs to the wise man to consider the highest causes.

[2] Now, the end of each thing is that which is intended by its first author or mover. But the first author and mover of the universe is an intellect, as will be later shown. The ultimate end of the universe must, therefore, be the good of an intellect. This good is truth. Truth must consequently be the ultimate end of the whole universe, and the consideration of the wise man aims principally at truth. So it is that, according to His own statement, divine Wisdom testifies that He has assumed flesh and come into the world in order to make the truth known: “For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I should give testimony to the truth” (John 18:37). The Philosopher himself establishes that first philosophy is the science of truth, not of any truth, but of that truth which is the origin of all truth, namely, which belongs to the first principle whereby all things are. The truth belonging to such a principle is, clearly, the source of all truth; for things have the same disposition in truth as in being.

[3] It belongs to one and the same science, however, both to pursue one of two contraries and to oppose the other. Medicine, for example, seeks to effect health and to eliminate illness. Hence, just as it belongs to the wise man to meditate especially on the truth belonging to the first principle and to teach it to others, so it belongs to him to refute the opposing falsehood.

[4] Appropriately, therefore, is the twofold office of the wise man shown from the mouth of Wisdom in our opening words: to meditate and speak forth of the divine truth, which is truth in person (Wisdom touches on this in the words my mouth shall meditate truth), and to refute the opposing error (which Wisdom touches on in the words and my lips shall hate impiety). By impiety is here meant falsehood against the divine truth. This falsehood is contrary to religion, which is likewise named piety. Hence, the falsehood contrary to it is called impiety.

Chapter 2

THE AUTHOR’S INTENTION IN THE PRESENT WORK

[1] Among all human pursuits, the pursuit of wisdom is more perfect, more noble, more useful, and more full of joy.

It is more perfect because, in so far as a man gives himself to the pursuit of wisdom, so far does he even now have some share in true beatitude. And so a wise man has said: “Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom” (Sirach 14:22).

It is more noble because through this pursuit man especially approaches to a likeness to God Who “made all things in wisdom” (Ps. 103:24). And since likeness is the cause of love, the pursuit of wisdom especially joins man to God in friendship. That is why it is said of wisdom that “she is an infinite treasure to men! which they that use become the friends of God” (Wis. 7:14).

It is more useful because through wisdom we arrive at the kingdom of immortality. For “the desire of wisdom leads to the everlasting kingdom” (Wis. 6:21).

It is more full of joy because “her conversation has no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but joy and gladness” (Wis. 7:16).

[2] And so, in the name of the divine Mercy, I have the confidence to embark upon the work of a wise man, even though this may surpass my powers, and I have set myself the task of making known, as far as my limited powers will allow, the truth that the Catholic faith professes, and of setting aside the errors that are opposed to it. To use the words of Hilary: “I am aware that I owe this to God as the chief duty of my life, that my every word and sense may speak of Him” [De Trinitate I, 37].

[3] To proceed against individual errors, however, is a difficult business, and this for two reasons. In the first place, it is difficult because the sacrilegious remarks of individual men who have erred are not so well known to us so that we may use what they say as the basis of proceeding to a refutation of their errors. This is, indeed, the method that the ancient Doctors of the Church used in the refutation of the errors of the Gentiles. For they could know the positions taken by the Gentiles since they themselves had been Gentiles, or at least had lived among the Gentiles and had been instructed in their teaching. In the second place, it is difficult because some of them, such as the Mohammedans and the pagans, do not agree with us in accepting the authority of any Scripture, by which they may be convinced of their error. Thus, against the Jews we are able to argue by means of the Old Testament, while against heretics we are able to argue by means of the New Testament. But the Muslims and the pagans accept neither the one nor the other. We must, therefore, have recourse to the natural reason, to which all men are forced to give their assent. However, it is true, in divine matters the natural reason has its failings.

[4] Now, while we are investigating some given truth, we shall also show what errors are set aside by it; and we shall likewise show how the truth that we come to know by demonstration is in accord with the Christian religion.



Chapter 3

ON THE WAY IN WHICH DIVINE TRUTH IS TO BE MADE KNOWN

[1] The way of making truth known is not always the same, and, as the Philosopher has very well said, “it belongs to an educated man to seek such certitude in each thing as the nature of that thing allows.” The remark is also introduced by Boethius [De Trinitate II]. But, since such is the case, we must first show what way is open to us in order that we may make known the truth which is our object.

[2] There is a twofold mode of truth in what we profess about God. Some truths about God exceed all the ability of the human reason. Such is the truth that God is triune. But there are some truths which the natural reason also is able to reach. Such are that God exists, that He is one, and the like. In fact, such truths about God have been proved demonstratively by the philosophers, guided by the light of the natural reason.

[3] That there are certain truths about God that totally surpass man’s ability appears with the greatest evidence. Since, indeed, the principle of all knowledge that the reason perceives about some thing is the understanding of the very substance of that being (for according to Aristotle “what a thing is” is the principle of demonstration) [Posterior Analytics II, 3], it is necessary that the way in which we understand the substance of a thing determines the way in which we know what belongs to it. Hence, if the human intellect comprehends the substance of some thing, for example, that of a stone or of a triangle, no intelligible characteristic belonging to that thing surpasses the grasp of the human reason. But this does not happen to us in the case of God. For the human intellect is not able to reach a comprehension of the divine substance through its natural power. For, according to its manner of knowing in the present life, the intellect depends on the sense for the origin of knowledge; and so those things that do not fall under the senses cannot be grasped by the human intellect except in so far as the knowledge of them is gathered from sensible things. Now, sensible things cannot lead the human intellect to the point of seeing in them the nature of the divine substance; for sensible things are effects that fall short of the power of their cause. Yet, beginning with sensible things, our intellect is led to the point of knowing about God that He exists, and other such characteristics that must be attributed to the First Principle. There are, consequently, some intelligible truths about God that are open to the human reason; but there are others that absolutely surpass its power.

[4] We may easily see the same point from the gradation of intellects. Consider the case of two persons of whom one has a more penetrating grasp of a thing by his intellect than, does the other. He who has the superior intellect understands many things that the other cannot grasp at all. Such is the case with a very simple person who cannot at all grasp the subtle speculations of philosophy. But the intellect of an angel surpasses the human intellect much more than the intellect of the greatest philosopher surpasses the intellect of the most uncultivated simple person; for the distance between the best philosopher and a simple person is contained within the limits of the human species, which the angelic intellect surpasses. For the angel knows God on the basis of a more noble effect than does man; and this by as much as the substance of an angel, through which the angel in his natural knowledge is led to the knowledge of God, is nobler than sensible things and even than the soul itself, through which the human intellect mounts to the knowledge of God. The divine intellect surpasses the angelic intellect much more than the angelic surpasses the human. For the divine intellect is in its capacity equal to its substance, and therefore it understands fully what it is, including all its intelligible attributes. But by his natural knowledge the angel does not know what God is, since the substance itself of the angel, through which he is led to the knowledge of God, is an effect that is not equal to the power of its cause. Hence, the angel is not able, by means of his natural knowledge, to grasp all the things that God understands in Himself; nor is the human reason sufficient to grasp all the things that the angel understands through his own natural power. Just as, therefore, it would he the height of folly for a simple person to assert that what a philosopher proposes is false on the ground that he himself cannot understand it, so (and even more so) it is the acme of stupidity for a man to suspect as false what is divinely revealed through the ministry of the angels simply because it cannot be investigated by reason.

[5] The same thing, moreover, appears quite clearly from the defect that we experience every day in our knowledge of things. We do not know a great many of the properties of sensible things, and in most cases we are not able to discover fully the natures of those properties that we apprehend by the sense. Much more is it the case, therefore, that the human reason is not equal to the task of investigating all the intelligible characteristics of that most excellent substance.

[6] The remark of Aristotle likewise agrees with this conclusion. He says that “our intellect is related to the prime beings, which are most evident in their nature, as the eye of an owl is related to the sun” [Metaphysics Ia, 1]

[7] Sacred Scripture also gives testimony to this truth. We read in Job: “Do you think you can comprehend the depths of God, and find the limit of the Almighty?” (11:7). And again: “Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge” (Job 36:26). And St. Paul: “We know in part” (1 Cor. 13:9).

[8] We should not, therefore, immediately reject as false, following the opinion of the Manicheans and many unbelievers, everything that is said about God even though it cannot be investigated by reason.



Chapter 4

THAT THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD TO WHICH THE NATURAL REASON REACHES IS FITTINGLY PROPOSED TO MEN FOR BELIEF

[1] Since, therefore, there exists a twofold truth concerning the divine being, one to which the inquiry of the reason can reach, the other which surpasses the whole ability of the human reason, it is fitting that both of these truths be proposed to man divinely for belief. This point must first be shown concerning the truth that is open to the inquiry of the reason; otherwise, it might perhaps seem to someone that, since such a truth can be known by the reason, it was uselessly given to men through a supernatural inspiration as an object of belief.

[2] Yet, if this truth were left solely as a matter of inquiry for the human reason, three awkward consequences would follow.

[3] The first is that few men would possess the knowledge of God. For there are three reasons why most men are cut off from the fruit of diligent inquiry which is the discovery of truth. Some do not have the physical disposition for such work. As a result, there are many who are naturally not fitted to pursue knowledge; and so, however much they tried, they would be unable to reach the highest level of human knowledge which consists in knowing God. Others are cut off from pursuing this truth by the necessities imposed upon them by their daily lives. For some men must devote themselves to taking care of temporal matters. Such men would not be able to give so much time to the leisure of contemplative inquiry as to reach the highest peak at which human investigation can arrive, namely, the knowledge of God. Finally, there are some who are cut off by indolence. In order to know the things that the reason can investigate concerning God, a knowledge of many things must already be possessed. For almost all of philosophy is directed towards the knowledge of God, and that is why metaphysics, which deals with divine things, is the last part of philosophy to be learned. This means that we are able to arrive at the inquiry concerning the aforementioned truth only on the basis of a great deal of labor spent in study. Now, those who wish to undergo such a labor for the mere love of knowledge are few, even though God has inserted into the minds of men a natural appetite for knowledge.

[4] The second awkward effect is that those who would come to discover the abovementioned truth would barely reach it after a great deal of time. The reasons are several. There is the profundity of this truth, which the human intellect is made capable of grasping by natural inquiry only after a long training. Then, there are many things that must be presupposed, as we have said. There is also the fact that, in youth, when the soul is swayed by the various movements of the passions, it is not in a suitable state for the knowledge of such lofty truth. On the contrary, “one becomes wise and knowing in repose,” as it is said in the Physics [VII, 3]. The result is this. If the only way open to us for the knowledge of God were solely that of the reason, the human race would remain in the blackest shadows of ignorance. For then the knowledge of God, which especially renders men perfect and good, would come to be possessed only by a few, and these few would require a great deal of time in order to reach it.

[5] The third awkward effect is this. The investigation of the human reason for the most part has falsity present within it, and this is due partly to the weakness of our intellect in judgment, and partly to the admixture of images. The result is that many, remaining ignorant of the power of demonstration, would hold in doubt those things that have been most truly demonstrated. This would be particularly the case since they see that, among those who are reputed to be wise men, each one teaches his own brand of doctrine. Furthermore, with the many truths that are demonstrated, there sometimes is mingled something that is false, which is not demonstrated but rather asserted on the basis of some probable or sophistical argument, which yet has the credit of being a demonstration. That is why it was necessary that the unshakeable certitude and pure truth concerning divine things should be presented to men by way of faith.

[6] Beneficially, therefore, did the divine Mercy provide that it should instruct us to hold by faith even those truths that the human reason is able to investigate. In this way, all men would easily be able to have a share in the knowledge of God, and this without uncertainty and error.

[7] Hence it is written: “Henceforward walk not as the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having their understanding darkened” (Eph. 4:17-18). And again: “All your children shall be taught of the Lord” (Is. 54:13).



Chapter 5

THAT THE TRUTHS THE HUMAN REASON IS NOT ABLE TO INVESTIGATE ARE FITTINGLY PROPOSED TO MEN FOR BELIEF

[1] Now, perhaps some will think that men should not be asked to believe what the reason is not adequate to investigate, since the divine Wisdom provides in the case of each thing according to the mode of its nature. We must therefore prove that it is necessary for man to receive from God as objects of belief even those truths that are above the human reason.

[2] No one tends with desire and zeal towards something that is not already known to him. But, as we shall examine later on in this work, men are ordained by the divine Providence towards a higher good than human fragility can experience in the present life. That is why it was necessary for the human mind to be called to something higher than the human reason here and now can reach, so that it would thus learn to desire something and with zeal tend towards something that surpasses the whole state of the present life. This belongs especially to the Christian religion, which in a unique way promises spiritual and eternal goods. And so there are many things proposed to men in it that transcend human sense. The Old Law, on the other hand, whose promises were of a temporal character, contained very few proposals that transcended the inquiry of the human reason. Following this same direction, the philosophers themselves, in order that they might lead men from the pleasure of sensible things to virtue, were concerned to show that there were in existence other goods of a higher nature than these things of sense, and that those who gave themselves to the active or contemplative virtues would find much sweeter enjoyment in the taste of these higher goods.

[3] It is also necessary that such truth be proposed to men for belief so that they may have a truer knowledge of God. For then only do we know God truly when we believe Him to be above everything that it is possible for man to think about Him; for, as we have shown, the divine substance surpasses the natural knowledge of which man is capable. Hence, by the fact that son things about God are proposed to man that surpass his reason, there is strengthened in man the view that God is something above what he can think.

[4] Another benefit that comes from the revelation to men of truths that exceed the reason is the curbing of presumption, which is the mother of error. For there are some who have such a presumptuous opinion of their own ability that they deem themselves able to measure the nature of everything; I mean to say that, in their estimation, everything is true that seems to them so, and everything is false that does not. So that the human mind, therefore, might be freed from this presumption and come to a humble inquiry after truth, it was necessary that some things should be proposed to man by God that would completely surpass his intellect.

[5] A still further benefit may also be seen in what Aristotle says in the Ethics [X, 7]. There was a certain Simonides who exhorted people to put aside the knowledge of divine things and to apply their talents to human occupations. He said that “he who is a man should know human things, and he who is mortal, things that are mortal.” Against Simonides Aristotle says that “man should draw himself towards what is immortal and divine as much as he can.” And so he says in the De animalibus [I, 5] that, although what we know of the higher substances is very little, yet that little is loved and desired more than all the knowledge that we have about less noble substances. He also says in the De caelo et mundo [II, 12] that when questions about the heavenly bodies can be given even a modest and merely plausible solution, he who hears this experiences intense joy. From all these considerations it is clear that even the most imperfect knowledge about the most noble realities brings the greatest perfection to the soul. Therefore, although the human reason cannot grasp fully the truths that are above it, yet, if it somehow holds these truths at least by faith, it acquires great perfection for itself.

[6] Therefore it is written: “For many things are shown to you above the understanding of men” (Sirach 3:75). Again: “So the things that are of God no man knows but the Spirit of God. But to us God has revealed them by His Spirit” (1 Cor. 2:11, 10).



Chapter 6.

THAT TO GIVE ASSENT TO THE TRUTHS OF FAITH IS NOT FOOLISHNESS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ABOVE REASON

[1] Those who place their faith in this truth, however, “for which the human reason offers no experimental evidence,” do not believe foolishly, as though “following artificial fables” (2 Peter 2:16). For these “secrets of divine Wisdom” (Job 11:6) the divine Wisdom itself, which knows all things to the full, has deigned to reveal to men. It reveals its own presence, as well as the truth of its teaching and inspiration, by fitting arguments; and in order to confirm those truths that exceed natural knowledge, it gives visible manifestation to works that surpass the ability of all nature. Thus, there are the wonderful cures of illnesses, there is the raising of the dead, and the wonderful immutation in the heavenly bodies; and what is more wonderful, there is the inspiration given to human minds, so that simple and untutored persons, filled with the gift of the Holy Spirit, come to possess instantaneously the highest wisdom and the readiest eloquence. When these arguments were examined, through the efficacy of the abovementioned proof, and not the violent assault of arms or the promise of pleasure, and (what is most wonderful of all) in the midst of the tyranny of the persecutors, an innumerable throng of people, both simple and most learned, flocked to the Christian faith. In this faith there are truths preached that surpass every human intellect; the pleasures of the flesh are curbed; it is taught that the things of the world should be spurned. Now, for the minds of mortal men to assent to these things is the greatest of miracles, just as it is a manifest work of divine inspiration that, spurning visible things, men should seek only what is invisible. Now, that this has happened neither without preparation nor by chance, but as a result of the disposition of God, is clear from the fact that through many pronouncements of the ancient prophets God had foretold that He would do this. The books of these prophets are held in veneration among us Christians, since they give witness to our faith.

[2] The manner of this confirmation is touched on by St. Paul: “Which,” that is, human salvation, “having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed to us by them that hear Him: God also bearing them witness of signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Spirit” (Heb. 7:3-4).

[3] This wonderful conversion of the world to the Christian faith is the clearest witness of the signs given in the past; so that it is not necessary that they should be further repeated, since they appear most clearly in their effect. For it would be truly more wonderful than all signs if the world had been led by simple and humble men to believe such lofty truths, to accomplish such difficult actions, and to have such high hopes. Yet it is also a fact that, even in our own time, God does not cease to work miracles through His saints for the confirmation of the faith.

[4] On the other hand, those who founded sects committed to erroneous doctrines proceeded in a way that is opposite to this, The point is clear in the case of Muhammad. He seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom. Indeed, the truths that he taught he mingled with many fables and with doctrines of the greatest falsity. He did not bring forth any signs produced in a supernatural way, which alone fittingly gives witness to divine inspiration; for a visible action that can be only divine reveals an invisibly inspired teacher of truth. On the contrary, Muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his arms—which are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants. What is more, no wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning, Those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine teaching, through whose numbers Muhammad forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms. Nor do divine pronouncements on the part of preceding prophets offer him any witness. On the contrary, he perverts almost all the testimonies of the Old and New Testaments by making them into fabrications of his own, as can be. seen by anyone who examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on his part to forbid his followers to read the Old and New Testaments, lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those who place any faith in his words believe foolishly.



Chapter 7

THAT THE TRUTH OF REASON IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH

[1] Now, although the truth of the Christian faith which we have discussed surpasses the capacity of the reason, nevertheless that truth that the human reason is naturally endowed to know cannot be opposed to the truth of the Christian faith. For that with which the human reason is naturally endowed is clearly most true; so much so, that it is impossible for us to think of such truths as false. Nor is it permissible to believe as false that which we hold by faith, since this is confirmed in a way that is so clearly divine. Since, therefore, only the false is opposed to the true, as is clearly evident from an examination of their definitions, it is impossible that the truth of faith should be opposed to those principles that the human reason knows naturally.

[2] Furthermore, that which is introduced into the soul of the student by the teacher is contained in the knowledge of the teacher—unless his teaching is fictitious, which it is improper to say of God. Now, the knowledge of the principles that are known to us naturally has been implanted in us by God; for God is the Author of our nature. These principles, therefore, are also contained by the divine Wisdom. Hence, whatever is opposed to them is opposed to the divine Wisdom, and, therefore, cannot come from God. That which we hold by faith as divinely revealed, therefore, cannot be contrary to our natural knowledge.

[3] Again. In the presence of contrary arguments our intellect is chained, so that it cannot proceed to the knowledge of the truth. If, therefore, contrary knowledges were implanted in us by God, our intellect would be hindered from knowing truth by this very fact. Now, such an effect cannot come from God.

[4] And again. What is natural cannot change as long as nature does not. Now, it is impossible that contrary opinions should exist in the same knowing subject at the same time. No opinion or belief, therefore, is implanted in man by God which is contrary to man’s natural knowledge.

[5] Therefore, the Apostle says: “The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach” (Rom. 10:8). But because it overcomes reason, there are some who think that it is opposed to it: which is impossible.

[6] The authority of St. Augustine also agrees with this. He writes as follows: “That which truth will reveal cannot in any way be opposed to the sacred books of the Old and the New Testament” [De genesi ad litteram II, 18].

[7] From this we evidently gather the following conclusion: whatever arguments are brought forward against the doctrines of faith are conclusions incorrectly derived from the first and self-evident principles imbedded in nature. Such conclusions do not have the force of demonstration; they are arguments that are either probable or sophistical. And so, there exists the possibility to answer them.



Chapter 8

HOW THE HUMAN REASON IS RELATED TO THE TRUTH OF FAITH

[1] There is also a further consideration. Sensible things, from which the human reason takes the origin of its knowledge, retain within themselves some sort of trace of a likeness to God. This is so imperfect, however, that it is absolutely inadequate to manifest the substance of God. For effects bear within themselves, in their own way, the likeness of their causes, since an agent produces its like; yet an effect does not always reach to the full likeness of its cause. Now, the human reason is related to the knowledge of the truth of faith (a truth which can be most evident only to those who see the divine substance) in such a way that it can gather certain likenesses of it, which are yet not sufficient so that the truth of faith may be comprehended as being understood demonstratively or through itself. Yet it is useful for the human reason to exercise itself in such arguments, however weak they may be, provided only that there be present no presumption to comprehend or to demonstrate. For to be able to see something of the loftiest realities, however thin and weak the sight may be, is, as our previous remarks indicate, a cause of the greatest joy.

[2] The testimony of Hilary agrees with this. Speaking of this same truth, he writes as follows in his De Trinitate [II, 10, ii]: “Enter these truths by believing, press forward, persevere. And though I may know that you will not arrive at an end, yet I will congratulate you in your progress. For, though he who pursues the infinite with reverence will never finally reach the end, yet he will always progress by pressing onward. But do not intrude yourself into the divine secret, do not, presuming to comprehend the sum total of intelligence, plunge yourself into the mystery of the unending nativity; rather, understand that these things are incomprehensible.”



Chapter 9

THE ORDER AND MANNER OF PROCEDURE IN THE PRESENT WORK

[1] It is clearly apparent, from what has been said, that the intention of the wise man ought to be directed toward the twofold truth of divine things, and toward the destruction of the errors that are contrary to this truth. One kind of divine truth the investigation of the reason is competent to reach, whereas the other surpasses every effort of the reason. I am speaking of a “twofold truth of divine things,” not on the part of God Himself, Who is truth one and simple, but from the point of view of our knowledge, which is variously related to the knowledge of divine things.

[2] Now, to make the first kind of divine truth known, we must proceed through demonstrative arguments, by which our adversary may become convinced. However, since such arguments are not available for the second kind of divine truth, our intention should not be to convince our adversary by arguments: it should be to answer his arguments against the truth; for, as we have shown, the natural reason cannot be contrary to the truth of faith. The sole way to overcome an adversary of divine truth is from the authority of Scripture—an authority divinely confirmed by miracles. For that which is above the human reason we believe only because God has revealed it. Nevertheless, there are certain likely arguments that should be brought forth in order to make divine truth known. This should be done for the training and consolation of the faithful, and not with any idea of refuting those who are adversaries. For the very inadequacy of the arguments would rather strengthen them in their error, since they would imagine that our acceptance of the truth of faith was based on such weak arguments.

[3] This, then, is the manner of procedure we intend to follow. We shall first seek to make known that truth which faith professes and reason investigates. This we shall do by bringing forward both demonstrative and probable arguments, some of which were drawn from the books of the philosophers and of the saints, through which truth is strengthened and its adversary overcome [Books I-III]. Then, in order to follow a development from the more manifest to the less manifest, we shall proceed to make known that truth which surpasses reason, answering the objections of its adversaries and setting forth the truth of faith by probable arguments and by authorities, to the best of our ability [Book IV].

[4] We are aiming, then, to set out following the way of the reason and to inquire into what the human reason can investigate about God. In this aim the first consideration that confronts us is of that which belongs to God in Himself [Book I]. The second consideration concerns the coming forth of creatures from God [Book II]. The third concerns the ordering of creatures to God as to their end [Book III].

[5] Now, among the inquiries that we must undertake concerning God in Himself, we must set down in the beginning that whereby His Existence is demonstrated, as the necessary foundation of the whole work. For, if we do not demonstrate that God exists, all consideration of divine things is necessarily suppressed.



Chapter 10

THE OPINION OF THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD, BEING SELF-EVIDENT, CANNOT BE DEMONSTRATED

[1] There are some persons to whom the inquiry seeking to demonstrate that God exists may perhaps appear superfluous. These are the persons who assert that the existence of God is self-evident, in such wise that its contrary cannot be entertained in the mind. It thus appears that the existence of God cannot be demonstrated, as may be seen from the following arguments.

[2] Those propositions are said to be self-evident that are known immediately upon the knowledge of their terms. Thus, as soon as you know the nature of a whole and the nature of a part, you know immediately that every whole is greater than its part. The proposition God exists is of this sort. For by the name God we understand something than which a greater cannot be thought. This notion is formed in the intellect by one who hears and understands the name God. As a result, God must exist already at least in the intellect. But He cannot exist solely in the intellect, since that which exists both in the intellect and in reality is greater than that which exists in the intellect alone. Now, as the very definition of the name points out, nothing can be greater than God. Consequently, the proposition that God exists is self-evident, as being evident from the very meaning of the name God.

[3] Again, it is Possible to think that something exists whose non-existence cannot be thought. Clearly, such a being is greater than the being whose non-existence can be thought. Consequently, if God Himself could be thought not to be, then something greater than God could be thought. This, however, is contrary to the definition of the name God. Hence, the proposition that God exists is self-evident.

[4] Furthermore, those propositions ought to be the most evident in which the same thing is predicated of itself, for example, man is man, or whose predicates are included in the definition of their subjects, for example, Man is an animal. Now, in God, as will be shown in a later chapter, it is pre-eminently the case that His being is His essence, so that to the question what is He? and to the question is He? the answer is one and the same. Thus, in the proposition God exists, the predicate is consequently either identical with the subject or at least included in the definition of the subject. Hence, that God exists is self-evident.

[5] What is naturally known is known through itself, for we do not come to such propositions through an effort of inquiry. But the proposition that God exists is naturally known since, as will be shown later on, the desire of man naturally tends towards God as towards the ultimate end. The proposition that God exists is, therefore, self-evident.

[6] There is also the consideration that that through which all the rest are known ought itself to be self-evident. Now, God is of this sort. For just as the light of the sun is the principle of all visible perception, so the divine light is the principle of all intelligible knowledge; since the divine light is that in which intelligible illumination is found first and in its highest degree. That God exists, therefore, must be self-evident.

[7] These, then, and others like them are the arguments by which some think that the proposition God exists is so self-evident that its contrary cannot be entertained by the mind.



Chapter 11

A REFUTATION OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED OPINION AND A SOLUTION OF THE ARGUMENTS

[1] In part, the above opinion arises from the custom by which from their earliest days people are brought up to hear and to call upon the name of God. Custom, and especially custom in a child comes to have the force of nature. As a result, what the mind is steeped in from childhood it clings to very firmly, as something known naturally and self-evidently.

[2] In part, however, the above opinion comes about because of a failure to distinguish between that which is self-evident in an absolute sense and that which is self-evident in relation to us. For assuredly that God exists is, absolutely speaking, self-evident, since what God is is His own being. Yet, because we are not able to conceive in our minds that which God is, that God exists remains unknown in relation to us. So, too, that every whole is greater than its part is, absolutely speaking, self-evident; but it would perforce be unknown to one who could not conceive the nature of a whole. Hence it comes about, as it is said in Metaphysics II [Ia, 1], that “our intellect is related to the most knowable things in reality as the eye of an owl is related to the sun.”’

[3] And, contrary to the Point made by the first argument, it does not follow immediately that, as soon as we know the meaning of the name God, the existence of God is known. It does not follow first because it is not known to all, even including those who admit that God exists, that God is that than which a greater cannot be thought. After all, many ancients said that this world itself was God. Furthermore, no such inference can be drawn from the interpretations of the name God to be found in Damascene [De fide orthodoxa I, 9]. What is more, granted that everyone should understand by the name God something than which a greater cannot be thought, it will still not be necessary that there exist in reality something than which a greater cannot be thought. For a thing and the definition of a name are posited in the same way. Now, from the fact that that which is indicated by the name God is conceived by the mind, it does not follow that God exists save only in the intellect. Hence, that than which a greater cannot be thought will likewise not have to exist save only in the intellect. From this it does not follow that there exists in reality something than which a greater cannot be thought. No difficulty, consequently, befalls anyone who posits that God does not exist. For that something greater can be thought than anything given in reality or in the intellect is a difficulty only to him who admits that there is something than which a greater cannot be thought in reality.

[4] Nor, again, is it necessary, as the second argument advanced, that something greater than God can be thought if God can be thought not to be. For that He can be thought not to be does not arise either from the imperfection or the uncertainty of His own being, since this is in itself most manifest. It arises, rather, from the weakness of our intellect, which cannot behold God Himself except through His effects and which is thus led to know His existence through reasoning.

[5] This enables us to solve the third argument as well. For just as it is evident to us that a whole is greater than a part of itself, so to those seeing the divine essence in itself it is supremely self-evident that God exists because His essence is His being. But, because we are not able to see His essence, we arrive at the knowledge of His being, not through God Himself, but through His effects.

[6] The answer to the fourth argument is likewise clear. For man naturally knows God in the same way as he naturally desires God. Now, man naturally desires God in so far as he naturally desires beatitude, which is a certain likeness of the divine goodness. On this basis, it is not necessary that God considered in Himself be naturally known to man, but only a likeness of God. It remains, therefore, that man is to reach the knowledge of God through reasoning by way of the likenesses of God found in His effects.

[7] So, too, with the fifth argument, an easy solution is available. For God is indeed that by which all things are known, not in the sense that they are not known unless He is known (as obtains among self-evident principles), but because all our knowledge is caused in us through His influence.



Chapter 12

THE OPINION OF THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD CANNOT BE DEMONSTRATED BUT IS HELD BY FAITH ALONE

[1] There are others who hold a certain opinion, contrary to the position mentioned above, through which the efforts of those seeking to prove the existence of God would likewise be rendered futile. For they say that we cannot arrive at the existence of God through the reason; it is received by way of faith and revelation alone.

[2] What led some persons to hold this view was the weakness of the arguments which had been brought forth by others to prove that God exists.

[3] Nevertheless, the present error might erroneously find support in its behalf in the words of some philosophers who show that in God essence and being are identical, that is, that that which answers to the question what is it? is identical with that which answers to the question is it? Now, following the way of the reason we cannot arrive at a knowledge of what God is. Hence, it seems likewise impossible to demonstrate by the reason that God exists.

[4] Furthermore, according to the logic of the Philosopher, as a principle to demonstrate whether a thing is we must take the signification of the name of that thing [Posterior Analytics II, 9]; and, again according to the Philosopher [Metaphysics IV, 7], the meaning signified by a name is its definition. If this be so, if we set aside a knowledge of the divine essence or quiddity, no means will be available whereby to demonstrate that God exists.

[5] Again, if, as is shown in the Posterior Analytics [I, 18], the knowledge of the principles of demonstration takes its origin from sense, whatever transcends all sense and sensibles seems to be indemonstrable. That God exists appears to be a proposition of this sort and is therefore indemonstrable.

[6] The falsity of this opinion is shown to us, first, from the art of demonstration which teaches us to arrive at causes from their effects. Then, it is shown to us from the order of the sciences. For, as it is said in the Metaphysics [IV, 3], if there is no knowable substance higher than sensible substance, there will be no science higher than physics. It is shown, thirdly, from the pursuit of the philosophers, who have striven to demonstrate that God exists. Finally, it is shown to us by the truth in the words of the Apostle Paul: “For the invisible things of God... are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made” (Rom. 1:20).

[7] Nor, contrary to the first argument, is there any problem in the fact that in God essence and being are identical. For this is understood of the being by which God subsists in Himself. But we do not know of what sort this being is, just as we do not know the divine essence. The reference is not to the being that signifies the composition of intellect. For thus the existence of God does fall under demonstration; this happens when our mind is led from demonstrative arguments to form such a proposition of God whereby it expresses that He exists.

[8] Now, in arguments proving the existence of God, it is not necessary to assume the divine essence or quiddity as the middle term of the demonstration. This was the second view proposed above. In place of the quiddity, an effect is taken as the middle term, as in demonstrations quia. It is from such effects that the meaning of the name God is taken. For all divine names are imposed either by removing the effects of God from Him or by relating God in some way to His effects.

[9] It is thereby likewise evident that, although God transcends all sensible things and the sense itself, His effects, on which the demonstration proving His existence is based, are nevertheless sensible things. And thus, the origin of our knowledge in the sense applies also to those things that transcend the sense.



Chapter 13

ARGUMENTS IN PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

[1] We have now shown that the effort to demonstrate the existence of God is not a vain one. We shall therefore proceed to set forth the arguments by which both philosophers and Catholic teachers have proved that God exists.

[2] We shall first set forth the arguments by which Aristotle proceeds to prove that God exists. The aim of Aristotle is to do this in two ways, beginning with motion.

[3] Of these ways the first is as follows. Everything that is moved is moved by another. That some things are in motion—for example, the sun—is evident from sense. Therefore, it is moved by something else that moves it. This mover is itself either moved or not moved. If it is not, we have reached our conclusion—namely, that we must posit some unmoved mover. This we call God. If it is moved, it is moved by another mover. We must, consequently, either proceed to infinity, or we must arrive at some unmoved mover. Now, it is not possible to proceed to infinity. Hence, we must posit some prime unmoved mover.

[4] In this proof, there are two propositions that need to be proved, namely, that everything that is moved is moved by another, and that in movers and things moved one cannot proceed to infinity.

[5] The first of these propositions Aristotle proves in three ways. The first way is as follows. If something moves itself, it must have within itself the principle of its own motion; otherwise, it is clearly moved by another. Furthermore, it must be primarily moved. This means that it must be moved by reason of itself, and not by reason of a part of itself, as happens when an animal is moved by the motion of its foot. For, in this sense, a whole would not be moved by itself, but a part, and one part would be moved by another. It is also necessary that a self-moving being be divisible and have parts, since, as it is proved in the Physics [VI, 4], whatever is moved is divisible.

[6] On the basis of these suppositions Aristotle argues as follows. That which is held to be moved by itself is primarily moved. Hence, when one of its parts is at rest, the whole is then at rest. For if, while one part was at rest, another part in it were moved, then the whole itself would not be primarily moved; it would be that part in it which is moved while another part is at rest. But nothing that is at rest because something else is at rest is moved by itself; for that being whose rest follows upon the rest of another must have its motion follow upon the motion of another. It is thus not moved by itself. Therefore, that which was posited as being moved by itself is not moved by itself. Consequently, everything that is moved must be moved by another.

[7] Nor is it an objection to this argument if one might say that, when something is held to move itself, a part of it cannot be at rest; or, again, if one might say that a part is not subject to rest or motion except accidentally, which is the unfounded argument of Avicenna. For, indeed, the force of Aristotle’s argument lies in this: if something moves itself primarily and through itself, rather than through its parts, that it is moved cannot depend on another. But the moving of the divisible itself, like its being, depends on its parts; it cannot therefore move itself primarily and through itself. Hence, for the truth of the inferred conclusion it is not necessary to assume as an absolute truth that a part of a being moving itself is at rest. What must rather be true is this conditional proposition: if the part were at rest, the whole would be at rest. Now, this proposition would be true even though its antecedent be impossible. In the same way, the following conditional proposition is true: if man is an ass, he is irrational.

[8] In the second way, Aristotle proves the proposition by induction [Physics VIII, 4]. Whatever is moved by accident is not moved by itself, since it is moved upon the motion of another. So, too, as is evident, what is moved by violence is not moved by itself. Nor are those beings moved by themselves that are moved by their nature as being moved from within; such is the case with animals, which evidently are moved by the soul. Nor, again, is this true of those beings, such as heavy and light bodies, which are moved through nature. For such beings are moved by the generating cause and the cause removing impediments. Now, whatever is moved is moved through itself or by accident. If it is moved through itself, then it is moved either violently or by nature; if by nature, then either through itself, as the animal, or not through itself, as heavy and light bodies. Therefore, everything that is moved is moved by another.

[9] In the third way, Aristotle proves the proposition as follows [VIII, 5]. The same thing cannot be at once in act and in potency with respect to the same thing. But everything that is moved is, as such, in potency. For motion is the act of something that is in potency inasmuch as it is in potency. That which moves, however, is as such in act, for nothing acts except according as it is in act. Therefore, with respect to the same motion, nothing is both mover and moved. Thus, nothing moves itself.

[10] It is to be noted, however, that Plato, who held that every mover is moved [Phaedrus], understood the name motion in a wider sense than did Aristotle. For Aristotle understood motion strictly, according as it is the act of what exists in potency inasmuch as it is such. So understood, motion belongs only to divisible bodies, as it is proved in the Physics [VI, 4]. According to Plato, however, that which moves itself is not a body. Plato understood by motion any given operation, so that to understand and to judge are a kind of motion. Aristotle likewise touches upon this manner of speaking in the De anima [III, 7]. Plato accordingly said that the first mover moves himself because he knows himself and wills or loves himself. In a way, this is not opposed to the reasons of Aristotle. There is no difference between reaching a first being that moves himself, as understood by Plato, and reaching a first being that is absolutely unmoved, as understood by Aristotle.

[11] The second proposition, namely, that there is no procession to infinity among movers and things moved, Aristotle proves in three ways.

[12] The first is as follows [VII, 1]. If among movers and things moved we proceed to infinity, all these infinite beings must be bodies. For whatever is moved is divisible and a body, as is proved in the Physics [VI, 4]. But every body that moves some thing moved is itself moved while moving it. Therefore, all these infinites are moved together while one of them is moved. But one of them, being finite, is moved in a finite time. Therefore, all those infinites are moved in a finite time. This, however, is impossible. It is, therefore, impossible that among movers and things moved one can proceed to infinity.



[13] Furthermore, that it is impossible for the abovementioned infinites to be moved in a finite time Aristotle proves as follows. The mover and the thing moved must exist simultaneously. This Aristotle proves by induction in the various species of motion. But bodies cannot be simultaneous except through continuity or contiguity. Now, since, as has been proved, all the aforementioned movers and. things moved are bodies, they must constitute by continuity or contiguity a sort of single mobile. In this way, one infinite is moved in a finite time. This is impossible, as is proved in the Physics [VII, 1].

[14] The second argument proving the same conclusion is the following. In an ordered series of movers and things moved (this is a series in which one is moved by another according to an order), it is necessarily the fact that, when the first mover is removed or ceases to move, no other mover will move or be moved. For the first mover is the cause of motion for all the others. But, if there are movers and things moved following an order to infinity, there will be no first mover, but all would be as intermediate movers. Therefore, none of the others will be able to be moved, and thus nothing in the world will be moved.

[15] The third proof comes to the same conclusion, except that, by beginning with the superior, it has a reversed order. It is as follows. That which moves as an instrumental cause cannot move unless there be a principal moving cause. But, if we proceed to infinity among movers and things moved, all movers will be as instrumental causes, because they will be moved movers and there will be nothing as a principal mover. Therefore, nothing will be moved.

[16] Such, then, is the proof of both propositions assumed by Aristotle in the first demonstrative way by which he proved that a first unmoved mover exists.

[17] The second way is this. If every mover is moved, this proposition is true either by itself or by accident. If by accident, then it is not necessary, since what is true by accident is not necessary. It is something possible, therefore, that no mover is moved. But if a mover is not moved, it does not move: as the adversary says. It is therefore possible that nothing is moved. For, if nothing moves, nothing is moved. This, however, Aristotle considers to be impossible—namely, that at any time there be no motion. Therefore, the first proposition was not possible, since from a false possible, a false impossible does not follow. Hence, this proposition, every mover is moved by another, was not true by accident.

[18] Again, if two things are accidentally joined in some being, and one of them is found without the other, it is probable that the other can be found without it. For example, if white and musical are found in Socrates, and in Plato we find musical but not white, it is probable that in some other being we can find the white without the musical. Therefore, if mover and thing moved are accidentally joined in some being, and the thing moved be found without the mover in some being, it is probable that the mover is found without that which is moved. Nor can the example of two things, of which one depends on the other, be brought as an objection against this. For the union we are speaking of is not essential, but accidental.

[19] But, if the proposition that every mover is moved is true by itself, something impossible or awkward likewise follows. For the mover must be moved either by the same kind of motion as that by which he moves, or by another. If the same, a cause of alteration must itself be altered, and further, a healing cause must itself be healed, and a teacher must himself be taught and this with respect to the same knowledge. Now, this is impossible. A teacher must have science, whereas he who is a learner of necessity does not have it. So that, if the proposition were true, the same thing would be possessed and not possessed by the same being—which is impossible. If, however, the mover is moved by another species of motion, so that (namely) the altering cause is moved according to place, and the cause moving according to place is increased, and so forth, since the genera and species of motion are finite in number, it will follow that we cannot proceed to infinity. There will thus be a first mover, which is not moved by another. Will someone say that there will be a recurrence, so that when all the genera and species of motion have been completed the series will be repeated and return to the first motion? This would involve saying, for example, that a mover according to place would be altered, the altering cause would be increased, and the increasing cause would be moved according to place. Yet this whole view would arrive at the same conclusion as before: whatever moves according to a certain species of motion is itself moved according to the same species of motion, though mediately and not immediately.

[20] It remains, therefore, that we must posit some first mover that is not moved by any exterior moving cause.

[21] Granted this conclusion—namely, that there is a first mover that is not moved by an exterior moving cause—it yet does not follow that this mover is absolutely unmoved. That is why Aristotle goes on to say that the condition of the first mover may be twofold [VIII, 5]. The first mover can be absolutely unmoved. If so, we Save the conclusion we are seeking: there is a first unmoved mover. On the other hand, the first mover can be self-moved. This may be argued, because that which is through itself is prior to what is through another. Hence, among things moved as well, it seems reasonable that the first moved is moved through itself and not by another.

[22] But, on this basis, the same conclusion again follows. For it cannot be said that, when a mover moves himself, the whole is moved by the whole. Otherwise, the same difficulties would follow as before: one person would both teach and be taught, and the same would be true among other motions. It would also follow that a being would be both in potency and in act; for a mover is, as such, in act, whereas the thing moved is in potency. Consequently, one part of the self-moved mover is solely moving, and the other part solely moved. We thus reach the same conclusion as before: there exists an unmoved mover.

[23] Nor can it be held that both parts of the self-moved mover are moved, so that one is moved by the other, or that one moves both itself and the other, or that the whole moves a part, or that a part moves the whole. All this would involve the return of the aforementioned difficulties: something would both move and be moved according to the same species of motion; something would be at once in potency and in act; and, furthermore, the whole would not be primarily moving itself, it would move through the motion of a part. The conclusion thus stands: one part of a self-moved mover must be unmoved and moving the other part.

[24] But there is another point to consider. Among self-moved beings known to us, namely, animals, although the moving part, which is to say the soul, is unmoved through itself, it is yet moved by accident. That is why Aristotle further shows that the moving part of the first self-moving being is not moved either through itself or by accident [VIII, 6]. For, since self-moving beings known to us, namely, animals, are corruptible, the moving part in them is moved by accident. But corruptible self-moving beings must be reduced to some first self-moving being that is everlasting. Therefore, some self-moving being must have a mover that is moved neither through itself nor by accident.

[25] It is further evident that, according to the position of Aristotle, some self-moved being must be everlasting. For if, as Aristotle supposes, motion is everlasting, the generation of self-moving beings (this means beings that are generable and corruptible) must be endless. But the cause of this endlessness cannot be one of the self-moving beings, since it does not always exist. Nor can the cause be all the self-moving beings together, both because they would be infinite and because they would not be simultaneous. There must therefore be some endlessly self-moving being, causing the endlessness of generation among these sublunary self-movers. Thus, the mover of the self-moving being is not moved, either through itself or by accident.

[26] Again, we see that among beings that move themselves some initiate a new motion as a result of some motion. This new motion is other than the motion by which an animal moves itself, for example, digested food or altered air. By such a motion the self-moving mover is moved by accident. From this we may infer that no self-moved being is moved everlastingly whose mover is moved either by itself or by accident. But the first self-mover is everlastingly in motion; otherwise, motion could not be everlasting, since every other motion is caused by the motion of the self-moving first mover. Ile first self-moving being, therefore, is moved by a mover who is himself moved neither through himself nor by accident.

[27] Nor is it against this argument that the movers of the lower spheres produce an everlasting motion and yet are said to be moved by accident. For they are said to be moved by accident, not on their own account, but on account of their movable subjects, which follow the motion of the higher sphere.

[28] Now, God is not part of any self-moving mover. In his Metaphysics [XII, 7], therefore, Aristotle goes on from the mover who is a part of the self-moved mover to seek another mover—God—who is absolutely separate. For, since everything moving itself is moved through appetite, the mover who is part of the self-moving being moves because of the appetite of some appetible object. This object is higher, in the order of motion, than the mover desiring it; for the one desiring is in a manner a moved mover, whereas an appetible object is an absolutely unmoved mover. There must, therefore, be an absolutely unmoved separate first mover. This is God.

[29] Two considerations seem to invalidate these arguments. The first consideration is that, as arguments, they presuppose the eternity of motion, which Catholics consider to be false.

[30] To this consideration the reply is as follows. The most efficacious way to prove that God exists is on the supposition that the world is eternal. Granted this supposition, that God exists is less manifest. For, if the world and motion have a first beginning, some cause must clearly be posited to account for this origin of the world and of motion. That which comes to be anew must take its origin from some innovating cause; since nothing brings itself from potency to act, or from non-being to being.

[31] The second consideration is that the demonstrations given above presuppose that the first moved being, namely, a heavenly body, is self-moved. This means that it is animated, which many do not admit.

[32] The reply to this consideration is that, if the prime mover is not held to be self-moved, then it must be moved immediately by something absolutely unmoved. Hence, even Aristotle himself proposed this conclusion as a disjunction: it is necessary either to arrive immediately at an unmoved separate first mover, or to arrive at a self-moved mover from whom, in turn, an unmoved separate first mover is reached.

[33] In Metaphysics II [Ia, 2] Aristotle also uses another argument to show that there is no infinite regress in efficient causes and that we must reach one first cause—God. This way is as follows. In all ordered efficient causes, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, whether one or many, and this is the cause of the last cause. But, when you suppress a cause, you suppress its effect. Therefore, if you suppress the first cause, the intermediate cause cannot be a cause. Now, if there were an infinite regress among efficient causes, no cause would be first. Therefore, all the other causes, which are intermediate, will be suppressed. But this is manifestly false. We must, therefore, posit that there exists a first efficient cause. This is God.

[34] Another argument may also be gathered from the words of Aristotle. In Metaphysics II [Ia, 1] he shows that what is most true is also most a being. But in Metaphysics IV [4] he shows the existence of something supremely true from the observed fact that of two false things one is more false than the other, which means that one is more true than the other. This comparison is based on the nearness to that which is absolutely and supremely true. From these Aristotelian texts we may further infer that there is something that is supremely being. This we call God.

[35] Damascene proposes another argument for the same conclusion taken from the government of the world [De fide orthodoxa I, 3]. Averroes likewise hints at it [In II Physicorum]. The argument runs thus. Contrary and discordant things cannot, always or for the most part, be parts of one order except under someone’s government, which enables all and each to tend to a definite end. But in the world we find that things of diverse natures come together under one order, and this not rarely or by chance, but always or for the most part. There must therefore be some being by whose providence the world is governed. This we call God.



Chapter 14

THAT TO KNOW GOD WE MUST USE THE WAY OF REMOTION

[1] We have shown that there exists a first being, whom we call God. We must, accordingly, now investigate the properties of this being.

[2] Now, in considering the divine substance, we should especially make use of the method of remotion. For, by its immensity, the divine substance surpasses every form that our intellect reaches. Thus we are unable to apprehend it by knowing what it is. Yet we are able to have some knowledge of it by knowing what it is not. Furthermore, we approach nearer to a knowledge of God according as through our intellect we are able to remove more and more things from Him. For we know each thing more perfectly the more fully we see its differences from other things; for each thing has within itself its own being, distinct from all other things. So, too, in the case of the things whose definitions we know. We locate them in a genus, through which we know in a general way what they are. Then we add differences to each thing, by which it may be distinguished from other things. In this way, a complete knowledge of a substance is built up.

[3] However, in the consideration of the divine substance we cannot take a what as a genus; nor can we derive the distinction of God from things by differences affirmed of God. For this reason, we must derive the distinction of God from other beings by means of negative differences. And just as among affirmative differences one contracts the other, so one negative difference is contracted by another that makes it to differ from many beings. For example, if we say that God is not an accident, we thereby distinguish Him from all accidents. Then, if we add that He is not a body, we shall further distinguish Him from certain substances. And thus, proceeding in order, by such negations God will be distinguished from all that He is not. Finally, there will then be a proper consideration of God’s substance when He will be known as distinct from all things. Yet, this knowledge will not be perfect, since it will not tell us what God is in Himself.

[4] As a principle of procedure in knowing God by way of remotion, therefore, let us adopt the proposition which, from what we have said, is now manifest, namely, that God is absolutely unmoved. The authority of Sacred Scripture also confirms this. For it is written: “I am the Lord and I change not” (Mal. 3:6); ...“with whom there is no change” (James 2:17). Again: “God is not man... that He should be changed (Num. 23:19).



Chapter 15

THAT GOD IS ETERNAL

[1] From what we have said it is further apparent that God is eternal.

[2] Everything that begins to be or ceases to be does so through motion or change. Since, however, we have shown that God is absolutely immutable, He is eternal, lacking all beginning or end.

[3] Again. Those beings alone are measured by time that are moved. For time, as is made clear in Physics IV [11], is “the number of motion.” But God, as has been proved, is absolutely without motion, and is consequently not measured by time. There is, therefore, no before and after in Him; He does not have being after non-being, nor non-being after being, nor can any succession be found in His being. For none of these characteristics can be understood without time. God, therefore, is without beginning and end, having His whole being at once. In this consists the nature of eternity.

[4] What is more, if it were true that there was a time when He existed after not existing, then He must have been brought by someone from non-being to being. Not by Himself, since what does not exist cannot act. If by another, then this other is prior to God. But we have shown that God is the first cause. Hence, He did not begin to be, nor consequently will He cease to be, for that which has been everlastingly has the power to be everlastingly. God is, therefore, eternal.

[5] We find in the world, furthermore, certain beings, those namely that are subject to generation and corruption, which can be and not-be. But what can be has a cause because, since it is equally related to two contraries, namely, being and non-being, it must be owing to some cause that being accrues to it. Now, as we have proved by the reasoning of Aristotle, one cannot proceed to infinity among causes. We must therefore posit something that is a necessary being. Every necessary being, however, either has the cause of its necessity in an outside source or, if it does not, it is necessary through itself. But one cannot proceed to infinity among necessary beings the cause of whose necessity lies in an outside source. We must therefore posit a first necessary being, which is necessary through itself. This is God, since, as we have shown, He is the first cause. God, therefore, is eternal, since whatever is necessary through itself is eternal.

[6] From the everlastingness of time, likewise, Aristotle shows the everlastingness of motion [Physics VIII, 1], from which he further shows the everlastingness of the moving substance [VIII, 6]. Now, the first moving substance is God. God is therefore everlasting. If we deny the everlastingness of time and motion, we are still able to prove the everlastingness of the moving substance. For, if motion had a beginning, it must have done so through some moving cause. If this moving cause began, it did so through the action of some cause. Hence, either one will proceed to infinity, or he will arrive at a moving cause that had no beginning.

[7] To this truth divine authority offers witness. The Psalmist says: “But You, Lord, endure forever”; and he goes on to say: “But You art always the selfsame: and Your years shall not fail” (Ps. 101:13, 28).



Chapter 16

THAT THERE IS NO PASSIVE POTENCY IN GOD

[1] If God is eternal, of necessity there is no potency in Him.

[2] The being whose substance has an admixture of potency is liable not to be by as much as it has potency; for that which can be, can not-be. But, God, being everlasting, in His substance cannot not-be. In God, therefore, there is no potency to being.

[3] Though a being that is sometime in potency and sometime in act is in time in potency before being in act, absolutely speaking act is prior to potency. For potency does not raise itself to act; it must be raised to act by something that is in act. Hence, whatever is in some way in potency has something prior to it. But, as is evident from what was said above, God is the first being and the first cause. Hence, He has no admixture of potency in Himself.

[4] Moreover, that which is a necessary being through itself is in no way a possible being, since that which is through itself a necessary being has no cause, whereas, as we have shown above, whatever is a possible being has a cause. But God is through Himself a necessary being. He is, therefore, in no way a possible being, and so no potency is found in His substance.

[5] Again, each thing acts in so far as it is in act. Therefore, what is not wholly act acts, not with the whole of itself, but with part of itself. But what does not act with the whole of itself is not the first agent, since it does not act through its essence but through participation in something. The first agent, therefore, namely, God, has no admixture of potency but is pure act.

[6] Further, just as each thing naturally acts in so far as it is in act, so it is naturally receptive in so far as it is in potency; for motion is the act of that which exists in potency. But God is absolutely impassible and immutable, as is clear from what we have said. He has, therefore, no part of potency—that is, passive potency.

[7] Then, too, we see something in the world that emerges from potency to act. Now, it does not educe itself from potency to act, since that which is in potency, being still in potency, can therefore not act. Some prior being is therefore needed by which it may be brought forth from potency to act. This cannot go on to infinity. We must, therefore, arrive at some being that is only in act and in no wise in potency. This being we call God.



Chapter 17

THAT THERE IS NO MATTER IN GOD

[1] From this it is likewise evident that God is not matter.

[2] Whatever matter is, it is in potency.

[3] Matter, furthermore, is not a principle of acting. That is why, according to Aristotle, the efficient cause and matter do not coincide [Physics II, 7]. But, as we have said, it belongs to God to be the first efficient cause of things. Therefore, He is not matter.

[4] Moreover, for those who reduced all things to matter as to the first cause it follows that natural things exist by chance. Aristotle argues against these thinkers in Physics II [8]. Hence, if God, Who is the first cause, is the material cause of things, it follows that all things exist by chance.

[5] Again, matter does not become the cause of something actual except by being altered and changed. But if, as we have proved, God is absolutely immobile, He cannot in any way be the cause of things according to the mode of matter.

[6] Now, the Catholic faith professes this truth, namely, it asserts that God has created all things, not out of His own substance, but out of nothing.

[7] On this point, however, the madness of David of Dinant stands confounded. He dared to assert that God is the same as prime matter on the ground that, if He were not, He would have to differ from it by some differences, and thus they would not be simple. For in the being that differs from another by a difference, the difference itself produces a composition. David’s position was the result of ignorance. He did not know how to distinguish between difference and diversity. The different, as is determined in Metaphysics X [3], is said relationally, for every different is different by something. Something is called diverse, however, absolutely, from the fact that it is not the same. Difference, therefore, must be sought among those things that agree in something, for we must point to something in them according to which they differ: for example, two species agree in genus and must therefore be distinguished by differences. But in things that agree in nothing we need not seek the whereby they differ; they are diverse by themselves. In the same way, opposite differences are distinguished from one another. For they do not share in the genus as a part of their essence, and therefore, since they are by themselves diverse, there is no need to seek that by which they differ. In this way, too, God and prime matter are distinguished: one is pure act, the other is pure potency, and they agree in nothing.



Chapter 18

THAT THERE IS NO COMPOSITION IN GOD

[1] From what we have set down we can conclude that there is no composition in God.

[2] In every composite there must be act and potency. For several things cannot become absolutely one unless among them something is act and something potency. Now, beings in act are not united except by being, so to speak, bound or joined together, which means that they are not absolutely one. Their parts, likewise, are brought together as being in potency with respect to the union, since they are united in act after being potentially unitable. But in God there is no potency. Therefore, there is no composition in Him.

[3] Every composite, moreover, is subsequent to its components. The first being, therefore, which is God, has no components.

[4] Every composite, furthermore, is potentially dissoluble. This arises from the nature of composition, although in some composites there is another element that resists dissolution. Now, what is dissoluble can not-be. This does not befit God, since He is through Himself the necessary being. There is, therefore, no composition in God.

[5] Every composition, likewise, needs some composer. For, if there is composition, it is made up of a plurality, and a plurality cannot be fitted into a unity except by some composer. If, then, God were composite, He would have a composer. He could not compose Himself, since nothing is its own cause, because it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now, the composer is the efficient cause of the composite. Thus, God would have an efficient cause. Thus, too, He would not be the first cause—which was proved above.

[6] Again, in every genus the simpler a being, the more noble it is: e.g., in the genus of the hot, Ere, which has no admixture of cold. That, therefore, which is at the peak of nobility among all beings must be at the peak of simplicity. But the being that is at the peak of nobility among all beings we call God, since He is the first cause. For a cause is nobler than an effect. God can, therefore, have no composition.

[7] Furthermore, in every composite the good belongs, not to this or that part, but to the whole—and I say good according to the goodness that is proper to the whole and its perfection. For parts are imperfect in comparison with the whole, as the parts of man are not a man, the parts of the number six do not have the perfection of six, and similarly the parts of a line do not reach the perfection of the measure found in the whole line. If, then, God is composite, His proper perfection and goodness is found in the whole, not in any part of the whole. Thus, there will not be in God purely that good which is proper to Him. God, then, is not the first and highest good.

[8] Again, prior to all multitude we must find unity. But there is multitude in every composite. Therefore, that which is before all things, namely, God, must be free of all composition.



Chapter 19

THAT IN GOD THERE IS NOTHING VIOLENT OR UNNATURAL

[1] From this Aristotle concludes that in God there can be nothing violent or unnatural.

[2] Everything in which there is found something violent and outside nature has something added to itself, for what belongs to the substance of a thing can be neither violent nor outside nature. Now, nothing simple has anything added to itself, since this would render it composite. Since, then, God is simple, as we have shown, nothing in Him can be violent or outside nature.

[3] Furthermore, the necessity of coaction is a necessity from another. But in God there is no necessity from another; He is necessary through Himself and the cause of necessity for other things. Therefore, nothing in God is due to coaction.

[4] Again, wherever there is something violent, there can be something beyond what befits a thing through itself; for the violent is opposed to what is according to nature. But in God there cannot be anything beyond what befits Him according to Himself; for God, as we have shown, is of Himself the necessary being. There can, therefore, be nothing violent in God.

[5] Then, too, everything in which there can be something violent or unnatural is by nature able to be moved by another. For the violent is “that whose source is from the outside, the receiver being completely passive.” Now, as we have shown, God is absolutely immobile. There can, therefore, be nothing violent or unnatural in Him.



Chapter 20

THAT GOD IS NOT A BODY

[1] From the preceding remarks it is also shown that God is not a body.

[2] Every body, being a continuum, is composite and has parts. But, as we have shown, God is not composite, and is, therefore, not a body.

[3] Again, everything possessed of quantity is in a certain manner in potency. For a continuum is potentially divisible to infinity, while numbers can be increased to infinity. But every body has quantity and is therefore in potency. But God is not in potency, being pure act, as has been shown. Therefore, God is not a body.

[4] Furthermore, if God is a body, He must be some natural body, since, as the Philosopher proves, a mathematical body is not something self-existing, since dimensions are accidents. But God is not a natural body, being immobile, as we have shown, whereas every natural body is movable. God is, therefore, not a body.

[5] Again, every body is finite, as is proved in De caelo I [I, 5] of a circular body and a rectilinear body. Now, we can transcend any given finite body by means of the intellect and the imagination. If, then, God is a body, our intellect and imagination can think of something greater than God. God is thus not greater than our intellect—which is awkward. God is, therefore, not a body.

[6] Intellectual knowledge, moreover, is more certain than sensitive knowledge. In nature we find an object for the sense and therefore for the intellect as well. But the order and distinction of powers is according to the order of objects. Therefore, above all sensible things there is something intelligible among things. Now, every body having actual existence is sensible. Therefore, we can find something nobler above all bodies. Hence, if God is a body, He will not be the first and greatest being.

[7] A living thing, likewise, is nobler than any non-living body, and the life of a living body is nobler than it, since it is this life that gives to the living body its nobility above other bodies. Therefore, that than which nothing is nobler is not a body. Ibis is God. God is, therefore, not a body.

[8] Then, too, there are the arguments of the philosophers to the same effect, based on the eternity of motion. They are as follows. In every everlasting motion, the first mover cannot be moved either through Himself or by accident, as is clear from the above. Now, the body of the heavens is moved in a circle with an everlasting motion. Therefore, its first mover is not moved either through Himself or by accident. Now, no body moves locally unless it be moved, since the mover and the moved must be together. The moving body must thus be moved in order to be together with the moved body. But no power in a body moves unless it itself be moved by accident, since, when a body is moved, its power is by accident moved. The first mover of the heavens, therefore, is neither a body nor a power in a body. Now, that to which the motion of the heavens is ultimately reduced as to its first unmoved mover is God. God is, therefore, not a body.

[9] Again, no infinite power is a power in a magnitude. But the power of the prime mover is an infinite power. Therefore, it is not in any magnitude. Therefore, God, Who is the prime mover, is neither a body nor a power in a body.

[10] The first proposition is proved thus. If the power of some magnitude is infinite, it will be the power either of a finite magnitude or an infinite one. But there is no infinite magnitude, as is proved in Physics III [5] and De caelo I [5]. But a finite magnitude cannot have an infinite power. Therefore, an infinite power cannot reside in any magnitude. That an infinite power cannot reside in a finite magnitude is proved thus. A greater power produces an equal effect in a shorter time than a lesser power does in a longer time. This is true whether that effect be according to alteration, local motion, or any other motion whatever. But an infinite power is greater than every finite power. Therefore, by moving more swiftly, it should produce its effect in a shorter time than any finite power. Nor can it be in something lesser that still is in time, Therefore, this will be in an indivisible point of time. And thus to move, to be moved, and motion will take place in an instant—of which the contrary has been proved in Physics VI [3]. That an infinite power in a finite magnitude cannot move in time is likewise proved as follows. Let there be an infinite power A. Let us assume a part of that power to be AB. This part will, therefore, move in a greater time. Yet there must be some proportion of this time to the time in which the whole power moves, since both times are finite. Let these two times be related to one another in the proportion of one to ten, since for the present argument this proportion will do as well as any other. Now, if we add to the aforementioned finite power, we must diminish its time according to the proportion of the addition to the power; for a greater power moves in a lesser time. If the decuple be added, that power will move in a time that will be a tenth part of the time in which the first assumed part of the infinite power, namely, AB, moved. And yet this power, which is its decuple, is a finite power, since it has a determinate proportion to the finite power. Therefore, the finite and the infinite power will move in the same time—which is impossible. Therefore, the infinite power of a finite magnitude cannot move in time.

[11] That the power of the first mover is infinite is proved thus. No finite power can move in an infinite time. But the power of the first mover moves in an infinite time because the first motion is endless. Therefore, the power of the prime mover is infinite. Ile first proposition is proved thus. If the finite power of some body moves in an infinite time, a part of that body, having a part of the power, will move in a shorter time; for the greater the power of a mover, the more it will be able to keep up its motion in a longer time. Thus, the aforementioned part will move in a finite time, and a greater part will be able to move in a longer time. Thus, as we add to the power of the mover, we shall always add to the time according to the same proportion. But after a certain addition has been made, the addition win reach the quantity of the whole or even exceed it. So, too, an addition of time will reach the quantity of time in which it moves the whole. But the time in which it moved the whole was said to be infinite. Therefore, a finite time will measure an infinite time—which is impossible.

[12] But against this reasoning there are several objections.

[13] One objection is this. It can be assumed that the body that moves the first moved is not divisible, as is the case with a heavenly body. But the preceding proof is based on the division of the first body.

[14] The reply to this objection is as follows. There can be a true conditional proposition whose antecedent is impossible. If there is something that destroys the truth of this conditional proposition, it is then impossible. For example, if someone destroys the truth of the conditional proposition, If man flies, he has wings, it would be impossible. It is in this manner that the above proof is to be understood. For the following conditional proposition is true: If a heavenly body is divided, a part of it will have less power than the whole. Now, the truth of this conditional proposition is taken away if it be posited that the first mover is a body; and the reason is the impossibilities that follow from it. Therefore, to posit this is impossible. A similar reply can be given if objection is made concerning the increase of finite powers. We cannot assume powers in nature according to all proportions of time to any given time. Nevertheless, the proposition required in the above proof is a true conditional proposition.

[15] The second objection is this. Although a body is divided, it is possible to find in a given body a power that is not divided when the body is divided. For example, the rational soul is not divided if the body is divided.

[16] The reply is as follows. The above argument does not prove that God is not joined to a body as the rational soul is joined to the human body; it proves that He is not a power in a body in the manner of a material power, which is divided upon the division of the body. So, too, it is said of the human intellect that it is not a body or a power in a body. However, that God is not joined to a body as the soul is, this is another issue.

[17] The third objection is this. If some given body has a finite power, as the above argument shows, and if through a finite power nothing can endure through an infinite time, it will follow that no body can endure through an infinite time. Thus, a heavenly body will of necessity be corrupted.

[18] To this objection some reply that, as far as its own power is concerned, a heavenly body can fail, but it acquires an eternal duration from another being of an infinite power. Plato [Timaeus] seems to speak for this solution when he introduces God addressing the heavenly bodies as follows: “By your natures you are dissoluble, but through my will you are indissoluble; for my will is greater than your bond.”

[19] The Commentator attacks this position in Metaphysics XI. According to him, it is impossible that what can of itself not-be should acquire a perpetuity of being from another. This would mean that something corruptible becomes incorruptible, which according to him is impossible. Hence, Averroes answers the objection as follows. All the potency that is in a heavenly body is finite, but there is no reason why a heavenly body should have every potency. For, according to Aristotle in Metaphysics VIII, there is in a heavenly body potency with respect to place, but not with respect to being. Hence, a heavenly body need not have a potency to non-being.

[20] This reply of the Commentator, however, is not sufficient. Even if we should grant that in a heavenly body there is no sort of a passive potency to being, which is the potency of matter, yet there is in it a potency of an active kind, which is the power of being. For Aristotle expressly says in De caelo I [I, 3] that the heavens have the power to be forever.”

[21] Hence, it is better to reply as follows. Since potency is said relatively to act, we must judge of potency according to the mode of the act. Now, according to its nature, motion has quantity and extension, and hence its infinite duration requires that the potency moving it be infinite. But being does not have any quantitative extension, especially in the case of a thing, such as the heavens, whose being is without change. Hence, the power of being need not be infinite in a finite body, even though it will endure to infinity. For it is one and the same whether through that power something will endure for an instant or for an infinite time, since its changeless being is not touched by time except by accident.

[22] The fourth objection is this. In those beings that in moving are not themselves altered, it does not seem necessary that what moves in an infinite time should have an infinite power. For such a motion consumes nothing of their power, so that after they have moved for a time they are able to move for no less a time than before. Thus, the power of the sun is finite, and because its active power is not lessened by acting, it is able, according to its nature, to act on the sublunary world during an infinite time.

[23] To this the reply is, as we have proved, that a body does not move unless it be moved. If, then, it should happen that a certain body is not moved, that body will consequently not move. But in everything that is moved there is a potency towards opposites, since the termini of motion are opposites. Therefore, of itself, every body that is moved can also not-be-moved. But what can not-be-moved is not of itself able to be moved through endless time, and hence neither to move through endless time.

[24] The above demonstration, consequently, holds of the finite power of a finite body, which power of itself cannot move in an infinite time. But a body that of itself can be moved and not-moved, move and not-move, can acquire perpetuity of motion from another. This must be incorporeal. The first mover must, therefore, be incorporeal. Thus, according to its nature, nothing prevents a finite body, which acquires from another a perpetuity in being moved, from likewise having a perpetuity in moving. For the first heavenly body itself, according to its nature, can revolve the lower heavenly bodies with a perpetual motion, according as sphere moves sphere. Nor, according to the Commentator, is it impossible (as it was impossible in the me of perpetuity of being) that what of itself can be moved and not-moved should acquire perpetuity of motion from another. For motion is a certain flow out of the mover to the thing moved, and hence something moved can acquire from another a perpetuity of motion that it does not have of itself. To be, on the other hand, is something fixed and at rest in being, and, therefore, that which of itself is in potency to non-being cannot, as Averroes himself says [In XII Metaphysicorum], following the course of nature acquire from another a perpetuity of being.

[25] The fifth objection is that, following the above reasoning, there does not seem to be a greater reason why an infinite power is not in a magnitude rather than outside a magnitude. For in either case it will follow that it moves in null time.

[26] To this the reply is that, in magnitude, time, and motion, finite and infinite are found according to one and the same notion, as is proved in Physics III [4] and VI [2, 7]. Therefore, the infinite in one of them removes a finite proportion in the others. But in beings without magnitude there is no finite or infinite except equivocally. Hence, the aforementioned method of demonstration is not applicable among such potencies.

[27] There is, however, another and better answer. The heavens have two movers, a proximate one with a finite power, which is responsible for the fact that they have a finite velocity, and a remote mover with an infinite power, which is responsible for the fact that their motion can be of an infinite duration. And thus it is evident that an infinite power that is not in a magnitude can move a body in time, but not immediately. But a power that is in a magnitude must move immediately, since no body moves except by being moved. Hence, if it did move, it would follow that it would move in null time.

[28] An even better reply is this. A power that is not in a magnitude is an intellect, and moves by will. For we have proved that the intellect is not a corporeal power. Therefore, it moves according to the needs of the movable body and not the proportion of its power; whereas a power that is in a magnitude can move only through the necessity of nature. Thus, of necessity, it moves according to the proportion of its quantity. Hence, if it moves, it moves in an instant.

[29] Thus, with the removal of the preceding objections, we see that the argumentation of Aristotle stands.

[30] No motion, furthermore, which is from a corporeal mover can be continuous and regular, because in local motion a corporeal mover moves by pulling and pushing. Now, what is pulled or pushed is not uniformly disposed towards its mover from the beginning to the end of the motion, since at times it will be nearer and at other times farther away. Thus, no body can move with a continuous and regular motion. But the first motion is continuous and regular, as is proved in Physics VIII [7]. Therefore, the mover of the first motion is not a body.

[31] Again, no motion to an end that passes from potency to act can be endless, since when it reaches act the motion comes to rest. If, then, the first motion is endless, it must aim at an end that is always and in all ways in act. But such an end is not a body or a power in a body, since all such things are movable either through themselves or by accident. Therefore, the end of the first motion is neither a body nor a power in a body. But the end of the first motion is the first mover, which moves as something desired. This, however, is God. God, therefore, is neither a body nor a power in a body.

[32] However, although according to our faith it is false that the motion of the heavens is perpetual, as will be made evident later on, yet it is true that it will not fail either through a failure of power in the mover or through the corruption of the substance in the moved; for there is no evidence that the passing of time has slowed down the motion of the heavens. Hence, the above demonstrations do not lose their force.

[33] With this demonstrated truth divine authority stands in agreement. For it is said in John (4:24): “God is a spirit, and they that adore Him must adore Him in spirit and in truth.” It is likewise said: “To the King of ages. immortal, invisible, the only God” (1 Tim. 1:17). Again: “The invisible things of God... are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made” (Rom. 1:20); for what is seen, not by sight, but by the intellect, is incorporeal.

[34] Thereby is destroyed the error of the early natural philosophers, who posited only material causes, such as fire or water or the like, and who thus said that the first principles of things were bodies and called them gods. Among them there were some who further posited friendship and strife as moving causes. (They, too, were refuted through the above arguments.) For since, according to them, strife and friendship are in bodies, it will follow that the first moving principles are bodily powers. They also held that God is composed of the four elements and friendship, which would give us to understand that for them God was a heavenly body. Among the early thinkers, Anaxagoras alone approached the truth by positing that an intellect moved all things.

[35] By this truth, too, are refuted the Gentiles, who, taking their beginning in the errors of the philosophers we have listed, posited that the elements of the world and the powers in them are gods; for example, the sun, the moon, the earth, water, and the like.

[36] By the same arguments, moreover, are set aside the wild fantasies of the simple Jews, Tertullian, the Vodiani or Anthropomorphite heretics, who endowed God with a bodily figure; and also of the Manicheans, who thought that God was a certain infinite substance of light, stretched out through an infinite space.

[37] The occasion of all these errors was that, in thinking of divine things, men were made the victims of their imagination, through which it is not possible to receive anything except the likeness of a body. This is why, in meditating on what is incorporeal, we must stop following the imagination.



Chapter 21

THAT GOD IS HIS ESSENCE

[1] From what has been laid down we can infer that God is His essence, quiddity, or nature.

[2] There must be some composition in every being that is not its essence or quiddity. Since, indeed, each thing possesses its own essence, if there were nothing in a thing outside its essence all that the thing is would be its essence; which would mean that the thing is its essence. But, if some thing were not its essence, there should be something in it outside its essence. Thus, there must be composition in it. Hence it is that the essence in composite things is signified as a part, for example, humanity in man. Now, it has been shown that there is no composition in God. God is, therefore, His essence.

[3] Moreover, only that which does not enter the definition of a thing seems to be outside its essence or quiddity; for the definition signifies what a thing is. But it is only the accidents of a thing that do not fall in the definition; and therefore only the accidents in any thing are outside its essence. But, as will be shown, in God there are no accidents. There is, therefore, nothing in God outside His essence; and hence He is His essence.

[4] Furthermore, forms that are not predicated of subsisting things, whether these be considered universally or each is taken singly, are forms that do not subsist through themselves as singulars individuated in themselves. We do not say that Socrates, or man, or animal is whiteness, because whiteness does not subsist as a singular through itself but is individuated through its subsisting subjects. In the same way, also, natural forms do not subsist as singulars through themselves but are individuated in their proper matters. That is why we do not say that this fire, or fire, is its own form. The very essences or quiddities of genera and species are individuated through the designated matter of this or that individual, even though the quiddity of the genus or the species should include common form and matter. That is why we do not say that Socrates or man is humanity. But the divine essence exists through itself as a singular existent and individuated through itself; for, as we have shown, it is not in any matter. The divine essence is predicated of God, therefore, so that we may say: God is His essence.

[5] Again, the essence of a thing is either the thing itself or is related to the thing in some way as its cause; for a thing derives its species through its essence. But nothing can in any way be the cause of God, since, as we have shown, He is the first being. God is, therefore, His essence.

[6] Then, too, what is not its essence is related to its essence, according to some part of itself, as potency to act. That is why the essence is signified in the manner of a form, for example, humanity. But, as was shown above, there is no potentiality in God. He must, therefore, be His essence.



Chapter 22

THAT IN GOD BEING AND ESSENCE ARE THE SAME

[1] From what was proved above, however, we can further prove that His essence or quiddity is not something other than His being.

[2] For it was shown above that there is some being that must be through itself, and this is God. If, then, this being that must be belongs to an essence that is not that which it is, either it is incompatible with that essence or repugnant to it, as to exist through itself is repugnant to the quiddity of whiteness, or it is compatible with it or appropriate to it, as to be in another is to whiteness. If the first alternative be the case, the being that is through itself necessary will not befit that quiddity, just as it does not befit whiteness to exist through itself. If the second alternative be the case, either such being must depend on the essence, or both must depend on another cause, or the essence must depend on the being. The first two alternatives are contrary to the nature of that which is through itself a necessary being; for if it depends on another, it is no longer a necessary being. From the third alternative it follows that that quiddity is added accidentally to the thing that is through itself a necessary being; for what follows upon a thing’s being is accidental to it and hence not its quiddity. God, therefore, does not have an essence that is not His being.

[3] But against this conclusion it can be objected that that being does not absolutely depend on that essence, so as not to be unless the essence existed; it depends, rather, on the essence with reference to the union by which it is joined to it. Thus, that being is through itself necessary, but its union with the essence is not.

[4] However, this reply does not escape the aforementioned difficulties. For, if that being can be understood without that essence, it will follow that the essence is related to that being in an accidental way. But that being is that which is through itself a necessary being. Therefore, that essence is related in an accidental way to that which is through itself a necessary being. It is, therefore, not its essence. But that which is through itself a necessary being is God. That essence, then, is not the essence of God, but some essence below God. On the other hand, if that being cannot be understood without that essence, it depends absolutely on that on which its union to that essence depends. We then reach the same impasse as before.

15] Another argument. Each thing is through its own being. Hence, that which is not its own being is not through itself a necessary being. But God is through Himself a necessary being. He is, therefore, His own being.

[6] Again, if God’s being is not His essence, and cannot be part of that essence, since, as we have shown, the divine essence is simple, such a being must be something outside the divine essence. But whatever belongs to a thing and is yet not of its essence belongs to it through some cause; for, if things that are not through themselves one are joined, they must be joined through some cause. Being, therefore, belongs to that quiddity through some cause. This is either through something that is part of the essence of that thing, or the essence itself, or through something else. If we adopt the first alternative, and it is a fact that the essence is through that being, it follows that something is the cause of its own being. This is impossible, because, in their notions, the existence of the cause is prior to that of the effect. If, then, something were its own cause of being, it would be understood to be before it had being—which is impossible, unless we understand that something is the cause of its own being in an accidental order, which is being in an accidental way. This is not impossible. It is possible that there be an accidental being that is caused by the principles of its subject before the substantial being of its subject is understood as given. Here, however, we are speaking of substantial being, not accidental being. On the other hand, if the being belongs to the essence through some other cause, then this follows: given that what acquires its being from another cause is something caused, and is not the first cause, whereas God, as was demonstrated above, is the first cause and has no cause, the quiddity that acquires its being from another is not the quiddity of God. God's being must, therefore, be His quiddity.

[7] Being, furthermore, is the name of an act, for a thing is not said to be because it is in potency but because it is in act. Everything, however, that has an act diverse from it is related to that act as potency to act; for potency and act are said relatively to one another. If, then, the divine essence is something other than its being, the essence and the being are thereby related as potency and act. But we have shown that in God there is no potency, but that He is pure act. God's essence, therefore, is not something other than His being.

[8] Moreover, if something can exist only when several elements come together, it is composite. But no thing in which the essence is other than the being can exist unless several elements come together, namely, the essence and the being. Hence, every thing in which the essence is other than the being is composite. But, as we have shown, God is not composite. Therefore, God's being is His essence.

[9] Every thing, furthermore, exists because it has being. A thing whose essence is not its being, consequently, is not through its essence but by participation in something, namely, being itself. But that which is through participation in something cannot be the first being, because prior to it is the being in which it participates in order to be. But God is the first being, with nothing prior to Him. His essence is, therefore, His being.

[10] This sublime truth Moses was taught by our Lord. When Moses asked our Lord: “If the children of Israel say to me: what is His name? What shall I say to them?” The Lord replied: “I AM WHO AM.... You shall say to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS has sent me to you” (Exod. 3:13, 14). By this our Lord showed that His own proper name is HE WHO IS. Now, names have been devised to signify the natures or essences of things. It remains, then, that the divine being is God's essence or nature.

[11] Catholic teachers have likewise professed this truth. For Hilary writes in his book De Trinitate [II]: “Being is not an accident in God but subsisting truth, the abiding cause and the natural property His nature.” Boethius also says in his own work De Trinitate [II]: “The divine substance is being itself, and from it comes being.”



Chapter 23

THAT NO ACCIDENT IS FOUND IN GOD

[1] It follows necessarily from this truth that nothing can come to God beyond His essence, nor can there be anything in Him in an accidental way.

[2] For being cannot participate in anything that is not of its essence, although that which is can participate in something. The reason is that nothing is more formal or more simple than being, which thus participates in nothing. But the divine substance is being itself, and therefore has nothing that is not of its substance. Hence, no accident can reside in it.

[3] Furthermore, what is present in a thing accidentally has a cause of its presence, since it is outside the essence of the thing in which it is found. If, then, something is found in God accidentally, this must be through some cause. Now, the cause of the accident is either the divine essence itself or something else. If something else, it must act on the divine essence, since nothing will cause the introduction of some form, substantial or accidental, in some receiving subject except by acting on it in some way. For to act is nothing other than to make something actual, which takes place through a form. Thus, God will suffer and receive the action of some cause—which is contrary to what we already established. On the other hand, let us suppose that the divine substance is the cause of the accident inhering in it. Now it is impossible that it be, as receiving it, the cause of the accident, for then one and the same thing would make itself to be actual in the same respect. Therefore, if there is an accident in God, it will be according to different respects that He receives and causes that accident, just as bodily things receive their accidents through the nature of their matter and cause them through their form. Thus, God will be composite. But, we have proved the contrary of this proposition above.

[4] Every subject of an accident, moreover, is related to it as potency to act, since the accident is a certain form making the subject to be actual according to an accidental being. But, as we have shown above, there is no potentiality in God. There can, therefore, be no accident in Him.

[5] Then, too, when a being has an accident inhering in it, it is in some way mutable according to its nature, since an accident can inhere or not-inhere. If, then, God has something belonging to Him in an accidental way, He will consequently be mutable. But the contrary of this was demonstrated above.

[6] Again, that which has an accident inhering in it is not whatever it has in itself, since an accident is not part of the essence of the subject. But God is what He has in Himself. There is, therefore, no accident in God. The minor proposition is proved thus. Everything is found in a more noble way in the cause than in an effect. But God is the cause of all things. Hence, whatever is in Him is there in the most noble way. Now, what a thing itself is, this belongs to it in a most perfect way. For this is some thing more perfectly one than when something is joined to something else substantially as form to matter; just as substantial union is more perfect than when something inheres in something else as an accident. God, then, is whatever He has.

[7] It is also a fact that a substance does not depend on an accident, although an accident depends on a substance. But what does not depend on something can sometimes be found without it. Some substance, then, can be found without an accident. This seems especially to fit the substance that is most simple, such as the divine substance is. The divine substance, therefore, has no accidents whatever.

[8] In dealing with this problem, Catholics likewise give assent to this opinion. Whence Augustine says in his De Trinitate [V, 4] that “there is no accident in God.”

[9] The proof of this truth serves as a refutation of the error of some Saracen theologians “who posit certain intentions superadded to the divine essence.



Chapter 24

THAT THE DIVINE BEING CANNOT 13E DETERMINED BY THE ADDITION OF SOME SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE

[1] We can likewise show from what we have said that nothing can be added to the divine being to determine it with an essential determination, as a genus is determined by its differences.

[2] Nothing can be in act unless everything that determines its substantial act of being exists. Thus, there cannot be an actual animal unless it be a rational or an irrational animal. Hence, the Platonists themselves, in positing the Ideas, did not posit self-existing Ideas of genera, which are determined to the being of their species through essential differences; rather, they posited self-existing Ideas solely of species, which for their determination need no essential differences. If, then, the divine being is determined essentially through something else superadded to it, it will be in act only if what is superadded is present. But the divine being, as we have shown, is the divine substance itself. Therefore the divine substance cannot be in act without the presence of something added; from which it can be concluded that it is not through itself a necessary being. But, we have proved the contrary of this proposition above.

[3] Moreover, what needs an addition in order to be is in potency in relation to this addition. But, as we have shown, the divine substance is not in any way in potency; rather, the divine substance is its being. The divine being, therefore, cannot be determined in its substance through something superadded to it.

[4] Again, that through which a thing derives being in act and is intrinsic to it is either the whole essence of that thing or a part of the essence. But that which determines something in an essential way makes that thing to be in act and is intrinsic to the determined thing; otherwise, the thing could not be determined substantially by it. It must therefore be either the essence itself or a part of the essence. But, if something is added to the divine being, this cannot be the whole essence of God, since it has already been shown that God’s being is not other than His essence. It must, then, be a part of the essence, which means that God will be composed of essential parts. But, we have proved the contrary of this above.

[5] Furthermore, what is added to a thing to give it a certain essential determination does not constitute its nature but only its being in act. For rational added to animal gains for animal being in act, but it does not constitute the nature of animal as animal, since the difference does not enter the definition of the genus. But, if something is added in God by which He is determined in His essence, that addition must constitute for the being to which it is added the nature of its own quiddity or essence, since what is thus added gains for a thing its being in act. But in God this “being in act” is the divine essence itself, as we have shown above. It remains, then, that to the divine being nothing can be added that determines it in an essential way, as the difference determines the genus.



Chapter 25

THAT GOD IS NOT IN SOME GENUS

[1] From this we infer necessarily that God is not in some genus.

[2] Every thing in a genus has something within it by which the nature of the genus is determined to its species; for nothing is in a genus that is not in some species of that genus. But, as we have shown, this determination cannot take place in God. God cannot, then, be in some genus.

[3] If, moreover, God is in a genus, either He is in the genus of accident or in that of substance. He is not in the genus of accident, since the first being and the first cause cannot be an accident. Neither can God be in the genus of substance, since the substance that is a genus is not being itself; otherwise, every substance would be its being and would thus not be caused by another—which is impossible, as is evident from what we have said. Therefore, God is not in some genus.

[4] Again, whatever is in a genus differs in being from the other things in that genus; otherwise, the genus would not be predicated of many things. But all the things that are in the same genus must agree in the quiddity of the genus, since the genus is predicated of all things in it in terms of what they are. In other words, the being of each thing found in a genus is outside the quiddity of the genus. This is impossible in God. God, therefore, is not in a genus.

[5] Then, too, each thing is placed in a genus through the nature of its quiddity, for the genus is a predicate expressing what a thing is. But the quiddity of God is His very being. Accordingly, God is not located in a genus, because then being, which signifies the act of being, would be a genus. Therefore, God is not in a genus.

[6] Now, that being cannot be a genus is proved by the Philosopher in the following way [Metaphysics III, 3]. If being were a genus we should have to find a difference through which to contract it to a species. But no difference shares in the genus in such a way that the genus is included in the notion of the difference, for thus the genus would be included twice in the definition of the species. Rather, the difference is outside what is understood in the nature of the genus. But there can be nothing that is outside that which is understood by being, if being is included in the concept of the things of which it is predicated. Thus, being cannot be contracted by any difference. Being is, therefore, not a genus. From this we conclude necessarily that God is not in a genus.

[7] From this it is likewise evident that God cannot be defined, for every definition is constituted from the genus and the differences.

[8] It is also clear that no demonstration is possible about God, except through an effect; for the principle of demonstration is the definition of that of which the demonstration is made.

[9] Now it can seem to someone that, although the name substance cannot properly apply to God because God does not substand accidents, yet the thing signified by the name is appropriate and thus God is in the genus of substance. For a substance is a being through itself. Now, this is appropriate to God, since we have proved that He is not an accident.

[10] To this contention we must reply, in accord with what we have said, that being through itself is not included in the definition of substance. For, if something is called being, it cannot be a genus, since we have already proved that being does not have the nature of a genus. Neither can what is through itself be a genus, since the expression seems to indicate nothing more than a negation. Something is said to be a being through itself because it is not in another. This is a pure negation, which likewise cannot constitute the nature of a genus; for a genus would then say, not what a thing is, but what it is not. The nature of substance, therefore, must be understood as follows. A substance is a thing to which it belongs to be not in a subject. The name thing takes its origin from the quiddity, just as the name being comes from to be. In this way, the definition of substance is understood as that which has a quiddity to which it belongs to be not in another. Now, this is not appropriate to God, for He has no quiddity save His being. In no way, then, is God in the genus of substance. Thus, He is in no genus, since we have shown that He is not in the genus of accident.



Chapter 26

THAT GOD IS NOT THE FORMAL BEING OF ALL THINGS

[1] We are now able to refute the error of certain persons who said that God is nothing other than the formal being of each thing.

[2] This being is divided into the being of substance and the being of accident. Now, we have proved that the divine being is neither the being of substance nor that of accident. God, therefore, cannot be that being by which each thing formally is.

[3] Furthermore, things are not distinguished from one another in having being, for in this they agree. If, then, things differ from one another, either their being must be specified through certain added differences, so that diverse things have a diverse being according to their species, or things must differ in that the being itself is appropriate to natures that are diverse in species. The first of these alternatives is impossible, since, as we have said, no addition can be made to a being in the manner in which a difference is added to a genus. It remains, then, that things differ because they have diverse natures, to which being accrues in a diverse way. Now, the divine being does not accrue to a nature that is other than it; it is the nature itself, as we have said. If, therefore, the divine being were the formal being of all things, all things would have to be absolutely one.

[4] Then, too, a principle is naturally prior to that whose principle it is. Now, in certain things being has something that is as its principle. For the form is said to be a principle of being, and so is the agent, that makes things to be in act. If, therefore, the divine being is the being of each thing, it will follow that God, Who is His own being, has some cause. Thus, He is not through Himself a necessary being. But, we have proved the contrary of this conclusion above.

[5] Moreover, that which is common to many is not outside the many except by the reason alone. Thus, animal is not something outside Socrates and Plato and the other animals except in the intellect that apprehends the form of animal stripped of all its individuating and specifying characteristics. For man is that which truly is animal; otherwise, it would follow that in Socrates and Plato there are several animals, namely, common animal itself, common man, and Plato himself. Much less, then, is common being itself something outside all existing things, save only for being in the intellect. Hence, if God is common being, the only thing that will exist is that which exists solely in the intellect. But we showed above that God is something not only in the intellect but also in reality. Therefore, God is not the common being of all things.

[6] Again, strictly speaking, generation is the way to being and corruption the way to non-being. For form is not the terminus of generation, and privation is not the terminus of corruption, except because a form causes being and privation non-being. If a form did not cause being, a thing which received such a form would not be said to be generated. Hence, if God is the formal being of all things, He will consequently be the terminus of generation. This is false, since, as we have shown above, God is eternal.

[7] It will also follow that the being of each thing has existed from eternity. Generation or corruption is therefore impossible. If it does exist, pre-existing being must accrue to something anew. It will therefore accrue either to something pre-existing or to something in no way pre-existing. In the first instance, since according to the above position the being of all existing things is one, it will follow that a thing that is said to be generated acquires, not a new being, but a new mode of being. The result is alteration, not generation. But, if the generated thing in no way pre-existed, it will follow that it is produced from nothing—which is contrary to the nature of generation. This position, therefore, entirely ruins generation and corruption and, as a consequence, is evidently impossible.

[8] Sacred Teaching as well casts aside this error in confessing that God is “high and elevated,” according to Isaiah (6:1), and that He is “over all,” according to Romans (9:5). For, if He is the being of all things, He is part of all things, but not over them.

[9] So, too, those who committed this error are condemned by the same judgment as are the idolaters who “gave the incommunicable name,” that is, of God, “to wood and stones,” as it is written (Wis. 14:21). If, indeed, God is the being of all things, there will be no more reason to say truly that a stone is a being than to say that a stone is God.

[10] Four factors seem to have contributed to the rise of this error. The first is the warped interpretation of certain authoritative texts. There is in Dionysius this remark [De caelisti hierarchia IV, 1]: “The being of all things is the super-essential divinity.” From this remark they wished to infer that God is the formal being of all things, without considering that this interpretation could not square with the words themselves. For, if the divinity is the formal being of all things, it will not be over all but among all, indeed a part of all. Now, since Dionysius said that the divinity was above all things, he showed that according to its nature it was distinct from all things and raised above all things. And when he said that the divinity is the being of all things, he showed that there was in all things a certain likeness of the divine being, coming from God. Elsewhere Dionysius has rather openly set aside this warped interpretation. He has said: “God neither touches nor is in any way mingled with other things, as a point touches a line or the figure of a seal touches wax” [De divinis nominibusi II, 5].

[11] The second cause leading them to this error is a failure of reason. For, since that which is common is specified or individuated through addition, they thought that the divine being, which receives no addition, was not some proper being but the common being of all things. They ignored the fact that what is common or universal cannot exist without addition, but is considered without addition. For animal cannot be without the difference rational or the difference irrational, although it is considered without these differences. What is more, although a universal may be considered without addition, it is not without the receptibility of addition; for, if no difference could be added to animal, it would not be a genus. The same is true of all other names. But the divine being is without addition not only in thought but also in reality; and not only without addition but also without the receptibility of addition. From the fact, then, that it neither receives nor can receive addition we can rather conclude that God is not common being but proper being; for His being is distinguished from all the rest by the fact that nothing can be added to it. Hence the Commentator says in the Book of Causes that, out of the purity of its goodness, the first cause is distinguished from the rest and in a manner individuated.

[12] The third factor that led them into this error concerns the divine simplicity. God is at the peak of simplicity. They therefore thought that the last point of resolution in our way of seeing things is God, as being absolutely simple. For it is not possible to proceed to infinity in composition among the things we know. Their reason also failed because they did not observe that what is most simple in our understanding of things is not so much a complete thing as a part of a thing. But, simplicity is predicated of God as of some perfect subsisting thing.

[13] A fourth factor that could have led them to their error is the mode of expression we use when we say that God is in all things. By this we do not mean that God is in things as a part of a thing, but as the cause of a thing that is never lacking to its effect. For we do not say that a form is in matter as a sailor is in a ship.



Chapter 27

THAT GOD IS NOT THE FORM OF ANY BODY

[1] Having shown that God is not the being of all things, we can likewise show that He is not the form of any thing.

[2] As we have shown, the divine being cannot belong to any quiddity that is not being itself. Now, only God is the divine being itself. It is impossible, therefore, for God to be the form of some other being.

[3] Furthermore, the form of a body is not the being itself, but a principle of being. But God is being itself. He is, therefore, not the form of a body.

[4] Again, the union of form and matter results in a composite, which is a whole with respect to the matter and the form. But the parts are in potency in relation to the whole. In God, however, there is no potentiality. Therefore, God cannot be a form united to some thing.

[5] Moreover, that which has being through itself is nobler than that which has being in another. But every form of a body has being in another. Since, then, God, as the first cause of being, is the noblest being, He cannot be the form of any being.

[6] The same conclusion can also be reached in the following way from the eternity of motion. If God is the form of some movable body, since He is the first mover, the composite will be self-moving. But something self-moving can be moved and not-moved. Both possibilities are found in it. But such a being does not of itself have an indefectibility of motion. Above the self-moving being, therefore, we must posit another first mover, which gives to the self-moving being the endlessness of its motion. Thus, God, Who is the first mover, is not the form of a self-moving body.

[7] This argumentation is suitable for those who posit the eternity of motion. Those who do not posit it can reach the same conclusion from the regularity of the motion of the heavens. For just as a self-mover can be at rest and in motion, so it can be moved more swiftly and less so. The necessity in the uniformity of the motion of the heavens, therefore, depends on some higher and absolutely immobile principle, which is not a part of a self-moving body as the form of that body.

[8] The authority of Scripture is in agreement with this truth. For it is said in a Psalm (8:2): “Your magnificence is elevated above the heavens”; and in Job (11:8, 9): “He is higher than heaven, and what will you do?... His measure is longer than the earth and deeper than the sea.”

[9] Thus, then, is removed the error of the Gentiles, who said that God is the soul of the heavens, or even the soul of the whole world. Thereby they defended the error of idolatry, by saying that the whole world was God not by reason of the body but by reason of the soul; just as man is said to be wise not by reason of the body but by reason of the soul. On the basis of this error the Gentiles thought it to follow that, not unfittingly, divine worship should be shown to the world and its parts. The Commentator also says that this point was the place where the Zabii stumbled and fell from wisdom—because, namely, they posited that God is the form of the heavens [In XII Metaphysicorum].



Chapter 28

ON THE DIVINE PERFECTION

[1] Although the things that exist and live are more perfect than the things that merely exist, nevertheless, God, Who is not other than His being, is a universally perfect being. And I call universally perfect that to which the excellence of no genus is lacking.

[2] Every excellence in any given thing belongs to it according to its being. For man would have no excellence as a result of his wisdom unless through it he were wise. So, too, with the other excellences. Hence, the mode of a thing’s excellence is according to the mode of its being. For a thing is said to be more or less excellent according as its being is limited to a certain greater or lesser mode of excellence. Therefore, if there is something to which the whole power of being belongs, it can lack no excellence that is proper to some thing. But for a thing that is its own being it is proper to be according to the whole power of being. For example, if there were a separately existing whiteness, it could not lack any of the power of whiteness. For a given white thing lacks something of the power of whiteness through a defect in the receiver of the whiteness, which receives it according to its mode and perhaps not according to the whole power of whiteness. God, therefore, Who is His being, as we have proved above, has being according to the whole power of being itself. Hence, He cannot lack any excellence that belongs to any given thing.

[3] But just as every excellence and perfection is found in a thing according as that thing is, so every defect is found in it according as in some way it is not. Now, just as God bas being wholly, so non-being is wholly absent from Him. For as a thing has being, in that way is it removed from non-being. Hence, all defect is absent from God. He is, therefore, universally perfect.

[4] Those things that merely exist are not imperfect because of an imperfection in absolute being. For they do not possess being according to its whole power; rather, they participate in it through a certain particular and most imperfect mode.

[5] Furthermore, everything that is imperfect must be preceded by something perfect. Thus, the seed is from the animal or the plant. The first being must, therefore, be most perfect. But we have shown that God is the first being. He is, therefore, most perfect.

[6] Again, each thing is perfect according as it is in act, and imperfect according as it is in potency and lacking act. Hence, that which is in no way in potency, but is pure act, must be most perfect. Such, however, is God. God is, therefore, most perfect.

[7] Nothing, moreover, acts except as it is in act. Hence, action follows the mode of act in the agent. It is therefore impossible that an effect brought forth by an action be of a more excellent act than is the act of the agent. On the other hand, it is possible that the act of the effect be less perfect than the act of the efficient cause, since an action can become weakened through the effect in which it terminates. Now, in the genus of the efficient cause there is a reduction to one cause, called God, as is evident from what we have said; and from this cause, as we shall show later on, all things come. Hence, it is necessary that whatever is found in act in any thing whatever must be found in God in a more eminent way than in that thing itself. But the converse is not true. God, therefore, is most perfect.

[8] In every genus, furthermore, there is something that is most perfect for that genus, acting as a measure for all other things in the genus. For each thing is shown to be more or less perfect according as it approaches more or less to the measure of its genus. Thus, white is said to be the measure among all colors, and the virtuous man among all men. Now, the measure of all beings cannot be other than God, Who is His own being. No perfection, consequently, that is appropriate to this or that thing is lacking to Him; otherwise, He would not be the common measure of all things.

[9] This is why, when Moses asked to see the divine countenance or glory, he received this reply from the Lord: “I will show you all good,” as it is written in Exodus (33:18, 19); by which the Lord gave Moses to understand that the fullness of all goodness was in Him. Dionysius likewise says: “God does not exist in a certain way; He possesses, and this before all others, all being within Himself absolutely and limitlessly” [De div. nom. V, 4].

[10] We must note, however, that perfection cannot be attributed to God appropriately if we consider the signification of the name according to its origin; for it does not seem that what is not made [factum] can be called perfect [perfectum]. But everything that comes to be is brought forth from potency to act and from non-being to being when it has been made. That is why it is rightly said to be perfect, as being completely made, at that moment when the potency is wholly reduced to act, so that it retains no non-being but has a completed being. By a certain extension of the name, consequently, perfect is said not only of that which by way of becoming reaches a completed act, but also of that which, without any making whatever, is in complete act. It is thus that, following the words of Matthew (5:48), we say that God is perfect: “Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.”



Chapter 29

ON THE LIKENESS OF CREATURES TO GOD

[1] In the light of what we have said, we are able to consider how a likeness to God is and is not possible in things.

[2] Effects that fall short of their causes do not agree with them in name and nature. Yet, some likeness must be found between them, since it belongs to the nature of action that an agent produce its like, since each thing acts according as it is in act. The form of an effect, therefore, is certainly found in some measure in a transcending cause, but according to another mode and another way. For this reason the cause is called an equivocal cause. Thus, the sun causes heat among these sublunary bodies by acting according as it is in act. Hence, the heat generated by the sun must bear some likeness to the active power of the sun, through which beat is caused in this sublunary world; and because of this beat the sun is said to be hot, even though not in one and the same way. And so the sun is said to be somewhat like those things in which it produces its effects as an efficient cause. Yet the sun is also unlike all these things in so far as such effects do not possess heat and the like in the same way as they are found in the sun. So, too, God gave things all their perfections and thereby is both like and unlike all of them.

[3] Hence it is that Sacred Scripture recalls the likeness between God and creatures, as when it is said in Genesis (1:26): “Let us make man to our image and likeness.” At times the likeness is denied, as in the text of Isaiah (40:18): “To whom then have you likened God, and what image will you make for Him?” or in the Psalm (82:1) [Vulgate]: “O God, who is like You?”

[4] Dionysius is in agreement with this argument when he says: “The same things are both like and unlike God. They are like according as they imitate as much as they can Him Who is not perfectly imitable, they are unlike according as effects are lesser than their causes” [De div. nom. IX, 7].

[5] In the light of this likeness, nevertheless, it is more fitting to say that a creature is like God rather than the converse. For that is called like something which possesses a quality or form of that thing. Since, then, that which is found in God perfectly is found in other things according to a certain diminished participation, the basis on which the likeness is observed belongs to God absolutely, but not to the creature. Thus, the creature has what belongs to God and, consequently, is rightly said to be like God. But we cannot in the same way say that God has what belongs to the creature. Neither, then, can we appropriately say that God is like a creature, just as we do not say that man is like his image, although the image is rightly said to be like him.

[6] All the less proper, moreover, is the expression that God is likened to a creature. For likening expresses a motion towards likeness and thus belongs to the being that receives from another that which makes it like. But a creature receives from God that which makes it like Him. The converse, however, does not hold. God, then, is not likened to a creature; rather, the converse is true.



Chapter 30

THE NAMES THAT CAN BE PREDICATED OF GOD

[1] From what we have said we can further consider what it is possible to say or not to say of God, what is said of Him alone, and also what is said of Him and other things together.

[2] Since it is possible to find in God every perfection of creatures, but in another and more eminent way, whatever names unqualifiedly designate a perfection without defect are predicated of God and of other things: for example, goodness, wisdom, being, and the like. But when any name expresses such perfections along with a mode that is proper to a creature, it can be said of God only according to likeness and metaphor. According to metaphor, what belongs to one thing is transferred to another, as when we say that a man is a stone because of the hardness of his intellect. Such names are used to designate the species of a created thing, for example, man and stone, for to each species belongs its own mode of perfection and being. The same is true of whatever names designate the properties of things, which are caused by the proper principles of their species. Hence, they can be said of God only metaphorically. But the names that express such perfections along with the mode of supereminence with which they belong to God are said of God alone. Such names are the highest good, the first being, and the like.

[3] I have said that some of the aforementioned names signify a perfection without defect. This is true with reference to that which the name was imposed to signify; for as to the mode of signification, every name is defective. For by means of a name we express things in the way in which the intellect conceives them. For our intellect, taking the origin of its knowledge from the senses, does not transcend the mode which is found in sensible things, in which the form and the subject of the form are not identical owing to the composition of form and matter. Now, a simple form is indeed found among such things, but one that is imperfect because it is not subsisting; on the other hand, though a subsisting subject of a form is found among sensible things, it is not simple but rather concreted. Whatever our intellect signifies as subsisting, therefore, it signifies in concretion; but what it signifies as simple, it signifies, not as that which is, but as that by which something is. As a result, with reference to the mode of signification there is in every name that we use an imperfection, which does not befit God, even though the thing signified in some eminent way does befit God. This is clear in the name goodness and good. For goodness has signification as something not subsisting, while good has signification as something concreted. And so with reference to the mode of signification no name is fittingly applied to God; this is done only with reference to that which the name has been imposed to signify. Such names, therefore, as Dionysius teaches [De divinis nominibus I, 5, De caelesti hierarchia II, 3], can be both affirmed and denied of God. They can be affirmed because of the meaning of the name; they can be denied because of the mode of signification.

[4] Now, the mode of supereminence in which the abovementioned perfections are found in God can be signified by names used by us only through negation, as when we say that God is eternal or infinite, or also through a relation of God to other things, as when He is called the first cause or the highest good. For we cannot grasp what God is, but only what He is not and how other things are related to Him, as is clear from what we said above.



Chapter 31

THAT THE DIVINE PERFECTION AND THE PLURALITY OF DIVINE NAMES ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE DIVINE SIMPLICITY

[1] From what has been said it can likewise be seen that the divine perfection and the plurality of names said of God are not opposed to His simplicity.

[2] We have said that all the perfections found in other things are attributed to God in the same way as effects are found in their equivocal causes. These effects are in their causes virtually, as heat is in the sun. For, unless the power of the sun belonged to some extent to the genus of heat, the sun acting through this power would not generate anything like itself. The sun, then, is said to be hot through this power not only because it produces heat, but also because the power through which it does this has some likeness to heat. But through the same power through which it produces heat, the sun produces also many other effects among sublunary bodies-for example, dryness. And thus heat and dryness, which in fire are diverse qualities, belong to the sun through one and the same power. So, too, the perfections of all things, which belong to the rest of things through diverse forms, must be attributed to God through one and the same power in Him. This power is nothing other than His essence, since, as we have proved, there can be no accident in God. Thus, therefore, God is called wise not only in so far as He produces wisdom, but also because, in so far as we are wise, we imitate to some extent the power by which He makes us wise. On the other hand, God is not called a stone, even though He has made stones, because in the name stone there is understood a determinate mode of being according to which a stone is distinguished from God. But the stone imitates God as its cause in being and goodness, and other such characteristics, as do also the rest of creatures.

[3] A similar situation obtains among the knowing and operative powers of man. For by its single power the intellect knows all the things that the sensitive part of the soul grasps through a diversity of powers-and many other things as well. So, too, the higher an intellect is, the more it can know more things through one likeness, while a lesser intellect manages to know many things only through many likenesses. So, too, a ruling power extends to all those things to which diverse powers under it are ordered. In this way, therefore, through His one simple being God possesses every kind of perfection that all other things come to possess, but in a much more diminished way, through diverse principles.

[4] From this we see the necessity of giving to God many names. For, since we cannot know Him naturally except by arriving at Him from His effects, the names by which we signify His perfection must be diverse, just as the perfections belonging to things are found to be diverse. Were we able to understand the divine essence itself as it is and give to it the name that belongs to it, we would express it by only one name. This is promised to those who will see God through His essence: “In that day there shall be one Lord, and His name shall be one” (Zach. 14:9).



Chapter 32

THAT NOTHING IS PREDICATED UNIVOCALLY OF GOD AND OTHER THINGS

[1] It is thereby evident that nothing can be predicated univocally of God and other things.

[2] An effect that does not receive a form specifically the same as that through which the agent acts cannot receive according to a univocal predication the name arising from that form. Thus, the heat generated by the sun and the sun itself are not called univocally hot. Now, the forms of the things God has made do not measure up to a spccific likeness of the divine power; for the things that God has made receive in a divided and particular way that which in Him is found in a simple and universal way. It is evident, then, that nothing can be said univocally of God and other things.

[3] If, furthermore, an effect should measure up to the species of its cause, it will not receive the univocal predication of the name unless it receives the same specific form according to the same mode of being. For the house that is in the art of the maker is not univocally the same house that is in matter, for the form of the house does not have the same being in the two locations. Now, even though the rest of things were to receive a form that is absolutely the same as it is in God, yet they do not receive it according to the same mode of being. For, as is clear from what we have said, there is nothing in God that is not the divine being itself, which is not the case with other things. Nothing, therefore, can be predicated of God and other things univocally.

[4] Moreover, whatever is predicated of many things univocally is either a genus, a species, a difference, an accident, or a property. But, as we have shown, nothing is predicated of God as a genus or a difference; and thus neither is anything predicated as a definition, nor likewise as a species, which is constituted of genus and difference. Nor, as we have shown, can there be any accident in God, and therefore nothing is predicated of Him either as an accident or a property, since property belongs to the genus of accidents. It remains, then, that nothing is predicated univocally of God and other things.

[5] Again, what is predicated of many things univocally is simpler than both of them, at least in concept. Now, there can be nothing simpler than God either in reality or in concept. Nothing, therefore, is predicated univocally of God and other things.

[6] Everything, likewise, that is predicated univocally of many things belongs through participation to each of the things of which it is predicated; for the species is said to participate in the genus and the individual in the species. But nothing is said of God by participation, since whatever is participated is determined to the mode of that which is participated and is thus possessed in a partial way and not according to every mode of perfection. Nothing, therefore, can be predicated univocally of God and other things.

[7] Then, too, what is predicated of some things according to priority and posteriority is certainly not predicated univocally. For the prior is included in the definition of the posterior, as substance is included in the definition of accident according as an accident is a being. If, then, being were said univocally of substance and accident, substance would have to be included in the definition of being in so far as being is predicated of substance. But this is clearly impossible. Now nothing is predicated of God and creatures as though they were in the same order, but, rather, according to priority and posteriority. For all things are predicated of God essentially. For God is called being as being entity itself, and He is called good as being goodness itself. But in other beings predications are made by participation, as Socrates is said to be a man, not because he is humanity itself, but because he possesses humanity. It is impossible, therefore, that anything be predicated univocally of God and other things.



Chapter 33

THAT NOT ALL NAMES ARE SAID OF GOD AND CREATURES IN A PURELY EQUIVOCAL WAY

[1] From what we have said it likewise appears that not everything predicated of God and other things is said in a purely equivocal way, in the manner of equivocals by chance.

[2] For in equivocals by chance there is no order or reference of one to another, but it is entirely accidental that one name is applied to diverse things: the application of the name to one of them does not signify that it has an order to the other. But this is not the situation with names said of God and creatures, since we note in the community of such names the order of cause and effect, as is clear from what we have said. It is not, therefore, in the manner of pure equivocation that something is predicated of God and other things.

[3] Furthermore, where there is pure equivocation, there is no likeness in things themselves; there is only the unity of a name. But, as is clear from what we have said, there is a certain mode of likeness of things to God. It remains, then, that names are not said of God in a purely equivocal way.

[4] Moreover, when one name is predicated of several things in a purely equivocal way, we cannot from one of them be led to the knowledge of another; for the knowledge of things does not depend on words, but on the meaning of names. Now, from what we find in other things, we do arrive at a knowledge of divine things, as is evident from what we have said. Such names, then, are not said of God and other things in a purely equivocal way.

[5] Again, equivocation in a name impedes the process of reasoning. If, then, nothing was said of God and creatures except in a purely equivocal way, no reasoning proceeding from creatures to God could take place. But, the contrary is evident from all those who have spoken about God.

[6] It is also a fact that a name is predicated of some being uselessly unless through that name we understand something of the being. But, if names are said of God and creatures in a purely equivocal way, we understand nothing of God through those names; for the meanings of those names are known to us solely to the extent that they are said of creatures. In vain, therefore, would it be said or proved of God that He is a being, good, or the like.

[7] Should it be replied that through such names we know only what God is not, namely, that God is called living because He does not belong to the genus of lifeless things, and so with the other names, it will at least have to be the case that living said of God and creatures agrees in the denial of the lifeless. Thus, it will not be said in a purely equivocal way.



Chapter 34

THAT NAMES SAID OF GOD AND CREATURES ARE SAID ANALOGICALLY

[1] From what we have said, therefore, it remains that the names said of God and creatures are predicated neither univocally nor equivocally but analogically, that is, according to an order or reference to something one.

[2] This can take place in two ways. In one way, according as many things have reference to something one. Thus, with reference to one health we say that an animal is healthy as the subject of health, medicine is healthy as its cause, food as its preserver, urine as its sign.

[3] In another way, the analogy can obtain according as the order or reference of two things is not to something else but to one of them. Thus, being is said of substance and accident according as an accident has reference to a substance, and not according as substance and accident are referred to a third thing.

[4] Now, the names said of God and things are not said analogically according to the first mode of analogy, since we should then have to posit something prior to God, but according to the second mode.

[5] In this second mode of analogical predication the order according to the name and according to reality is sometimes found to be the same and sometimes not. For the order of the name follows the order of knowledge, because it is the sign of an intelligible conception. When, therefore, that which is prior in reality is found likewise to be prior in knowledge, the same thing is found to be prior both according to the meaning of the name and according to the nature of the thing. Thus, substance is prior to accident both in nature, in so far as substance is the cause of accident, and in knowledge, in so far as substance is included in the definition of accident. Hence, being is said of substance by priority over accident both according to the nature of the thing and according to the meaning of the name. But when that which is prior in nature is subsequent in our knowledge, then there is not the same order in analogicals according to reality and according to the meaning of the name. Thus, the power to heal, which is found in all health-giving things, is by nature prior to the health that is in the animal, as a cause is prior to an effect; but because we know this healing power through an effect, we likewise name it from its effect. Hence it is that the health-giving is prior in reality, but animal is by priority called healthy according to the meaning of the name.

[6] Thus, therefore, because we come to a knowledge of God from other things, the reality in the names said of God and other things belongs by priority in God according to His mode of being, but the meaning of the name belongs to God by posteriority. And so He is said to be named from His effects.



Chapter 35

THAT MANY NAMES SAID OF GOD ARE NOT SYNONYMS

[1] It is likewise shown from what has been said that, although names said of God signify the same reality, they are yet not synonyms because they do not signify the same notion.

[2] For just as diverse things are likened through their diverse forms to the one simple reality that God is, so our intellect through its diverse conceptions is to some extent likened to God in so far as it is led through the diverse perfections of creatures to know Him. Therefore, in forming many conceptions of one thing, our intellect is neither false nor futile, because the simple being of God, as we have shown, is such that things can be likened to it according to the multiplicity of their forms. But in accord with its diverse conceptions our intellect devises diverse names that it attributes to God. Hence, since these names are not attributed to God according to the same notion, it is evident that they are not synonyms, even though they signify a reality that is absolutely one. For the signification of the name is not the same, since a name signifies the conception of the intellect before it signifies the thing itself understood by the intellect.



Chapter 36

HOW OUR INTELLECT FORMS A PROPOSITION ABOUT GOD

[1] From this it is further evident that, although God is absolutely simple, it is not futile for our intellect to form enunciations concerning God in His simplicity by means of composition and division.

[2] For although, as we have said, our intellect arrives at the knowledge of God through diverse conceptions, it yet understands that what corresponds to all of them is absolutely one. For the intellect does not attribute its mode of understanding to the things that it understands; for example, it does not attribute immateriality to a stone even though it knows the stone immaterially. It therefore sets forth the unity of a thing by a composition of words, which is a mark of identity, when it says, God is good or goodness. The result is that if there is some diversity in the composition, it is referred to the intellect, whereas the unity is referred to the thing understood by the intellect. On the same basis, our intellect sometimes forms an enunciation about God with a certain mark of diversity in it, through the use of a preposition, as when we say, there is goodness in God. Here, too, there is indicated a certain diversity, which belongs to the intellect, and a certain unity, which must be referred to the reality.



p style=""text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"">Chapter 37
THAT GOD IS GOOD

[1] From the divine perfection, which we have shown, we can conclude to the goodness of God.

[2] For that by which each thing is called good is the virtue that belongs to it; for “the virtue of each thing is what makes its possessor and his work good.” Now, virtue “is a certain perfection, for each thing is then called perfect when it reaches the virtue belonging to it,” as may be seen in Physics VII [3]. Hence, each thing is good from the fact that it is perfect. That is why each thing seeks its perfection as the good belonging to it. But we have shown that God is perfect. Therefore, He is good.

[3] Again, it was shown above that there is a certain first unmoved mover, namely, God’s This mover moves as a completely unmoved mover, which is as something desired. Therefore, since God is the first unmoved mover, He is the first desired. But something is desired in two ways, namely, either because it is good or because it appears to be good. The first desired is what is good, since the apparent good does not move through itself but according as it has a certain appearance of the good, whereas the good moves through itself. The first desired, therefore, God, is truly good.

[4] Furthermore, “the good is that which all things desire.” The Philosopher introduces this remark as a “felicitous saying” in Ethics I [1]. But all things, each according to its mode, desire to be in act; this is clear from the fact that each thing according to its nature resists corruption. To be in act, therefore, constitutes the nature of the good. Hence it is that evil, which is opposed to the good, follows when potency is deprived of act, as is clear from the Philosopher in Metaphysics IX [9]. But, as we have shown, God is being in act without potency. Therefore, He is truly good.

[5] Moreover,.the communication of being and goodness arises from goodness. This is evident from the very nature and definition of the good. By nature, the good of each thing is its act and perfection. Now, each thing acts in so far as it is in act, and in acting it diffuses being and goodness to other things. Hence, it is a sign of a being’s perfection that it “can produce its like,” as may be seen from the Philosopher in Meteorologica IV [3]. Now, the nature of the good comes from its being something appetible. This is the end, which also moves the agent to act. That is why it is said that the good is diffusive of itself and of being. But this diffusion befits God because, as we have shown above, being through Himself the necessary being, God is the cause of being for other things. God is, therefore, truly good.

[6] That is why it is written in a Psalm (72:1): “How good is God to Israel, to those who are of a right heart!” And again: “The Lord is good to those who hope in Him, to the soul that seeks Him” (Lam. 3:25).



Chapter 38

THAT GOD IS GOODNESS ITSELF

[1] From this we can conclude that God is His goodness.

[2] To be in act is for each being its good. But God is not only a being in act; He is His very act of being, as we have shown. God is, therefore, goodness itself, and not only good.

[3] Again, as we have shown, the perfection of each thing is its goodness. But the perfection of the divine being is not affirmed on the basis of something added to it, but because the divine being, as was shown above, is perfect in itself. The goodness of God, therefore, is not something added to His substance; His substance is His goodness.

[4] Moreover, each good thing that is not its goodness is called good by participation. But that which is named by participation has something prior to it from which it receives the character of goodness. This cannot proceed to infinity, since among final causes there is no regress to infinity, since the infinite is opposed to the end [finis]. But the good has the nature of an end. We must, therefore, reach some first good, that is not by participation good through an order toward some other good, but is good through its own essence. This is God. God is, therefore, His own goodness.

[5] Again, that which is can participate in something, but the act of being can participate in nothing. For that which participates is in potency, and being is an act. But God is being itself, as we have proved. He is not, therefore, by participation good; He is good essentially.

[6] Furthermore, in a simple being, being and that which is are the same. For, if one is not the other, the simplicity is then removed. But, as we have shown, God is absolutely simple. Therefore, for God to be good is identical with God. He is, therefore, His goodness.

[7] It is thereby likewise evident that no other good is its goodness. Hence it is said in Matthew (19:17): “One is good, God.”



Chapter 39

THAT THERE CANNOT BE EVIL IN GOD

[1] From this it is quite evident that there cannot be evil in God.

[2] For being and goodness, and all names that are predicated essentially, have nothing extraneous mixed with them, although that which is or good can have something besides being and goodness. For nothing prevents the subject of one perfection from being the subject of another, just as that which is a body can be white and sweet. Now, each nature is enclosed within the limits of its notion, so that it cannot include anything extraneous within itself. But, as we have proved, God is goodness, and not simply good. There cannot, therefore, be any non-goodness in Him. Thus, there cannot possibly be evil in God.

[3] Moreover, what is opposed to the essence of a given thing cannot befit that thing so long as its essence remains. Thus, irrationality or insensibility cannot befit man unless he ceases to be a man. But the divine essence is goodness itself, as we have shown. Therefore, evil, which is the opposite of good, could have no place in God—unless He ceased to be God, which is impossible, since He is eternal, as we have shown.

[4] Furthermore, since God is His own being, nothing can be said of Him by participation, as is evident from the above argument. If, then, evil is said of God, it will not be said by participation, but essentially. But evil cannot be so said of anything as to be its essence, for it would lose its being, which is a good, as we have shown. In evil, however, there can be nothing extraneous mixed with it, as neither in goodness. Evil, therefore, cannot be said of God.

[5] Again, evil is the opposite of good. But the nature of the good consists in perfection, which means that the nature of evil consists in imperfection. Now, in God, Who is universally perfect, as we have shown above, there cannot be defect or imperfection. Therefore, evil cannot be in God.

[6] Then, too, a thing is perfect according as it is in act. A thing will therefore be imperfect according as it falls short of act. Hence, evil is either a privation or includes privation. But the subject of privation is potency, which cannot be in God. Neither, therefore, can evil.

[7] If, moreover, the good is “that which is sought by all,” it follows that every nature flees evil as such. Now, what is in a thing contrary to the motion of its natural appetite is violent and unnatural. Evil in each thing, consequently, is violent and unnatural, so far as it is an evil for that thing; although, among composite things, evil may he natural to a thing according to something within it. But God is not composite, nor, as we have shown, can there be anything violent or unnatural in Him. Evil, therefore, cannot be in God.

[8] Scripture likewise confirms this. For it is said in the canonic Epistle of John (I, 1:5): “God is light and in Him there is no darkness”; and in Job (34:10) it is written: “Far from God be wickedness; and iniquity from the Almighty.”



Chapter 40

THAT GOD IS THE GOOD OF EVERY GOOD

[1] From the foregoing it is also shown that God is “the good of every good.”’

[2] For the goodness of each thing is its perfection, as we have said. But, since God is absolutely perfect, in His perfection He comprehends the perfections of all things, as has been shown. His goodness, therefore, comprehends every goodness. Thus, He is the good of every good.

[3] Moreover, that which is said to be of a certain sort by participation is said to be such only so far as it has a certain likeness to that which is said to be such by essence. Thus iron is said to be on fire in so far as it participates in a certain likeness of fire. But God is good through His essence, whereas all other things are good by participation, as has been shown. Nothing, then, will be called good except in so far as it has a certain likeness of the divine goodness. Hence, God is the good of every good.

[4] Since, furthermore, each thing is appetible because of the end, and since the nature of the good consists in its being appetible, each thing must be called good either because it is the end or because it is ordered to the end. It is the last end, then, from which all things receive the nature of good. As will be proved later on, this is God. God is, therefore, the good of every good.

[5] Hence it is that God, promising to Moses a vision of Himself, says: “I will show you all good” (Exod. 33:19). And in Wisdom (7:11), it is said of the divine wisdom: “All good things come to me together with her.”



Chapter 41

THAT GOD IS THE HIGHEST GOOD

[1] From this conclusion we prove that God is the highest good.

[2] For the universal good stands higher tlpn any particular good, just as “the good of the people is better than the good of an individual,” since the goodness and perfection of the whole stand higher than the goodness and perfection of the part. But the divine goodness is compared to all others as the universal good to a particular good, being, as we have shown, the good of every good. God is, therefore, the highest good.

[3] Furthermore, what is said essentially is said more truly than what is said by participation. But God is good essentially, while other things are good by participation, as we have shown. God is, therefore, the highest good.

[4] Again, “what is greatest in any genus is the cause of the rest in that genus,” for a cause ranks higher than an effect. But, as we have shown, it is from God that all things have the nature of good. God is, therefore, the highest good.

[5] Moreover, just as what is not mixed with black is more white, so what is not mixed with evil is more good. But Cod is most unmixed with evil, because evil can be in God neither in act nor in potency; and this belongs to God according to His nature, as we have shown. God is, therefore, the highest good.

[6] Hence what is written in 1 Samuel (2:2): “There is none holy as the Lord is.”



Chapter 42

THAT GOD IS ONE

[1] From what has been shown it is evident that God is one.

[2] For it is not possible that there be two highest goods, since that which is said by superabundance is found in only one being. But God, as we have shown, is the highest good. God is, therefore, one.

[3] Again, it has been shown that God is absolutely perfect, lacking no perfection. If, then, there are many gods, there must be many such perfect beings. But this is impossible. For, if none of these perfect beings lacks some perfection, and does not have any admixture of imperfection, which is demanded for an absolutely perfect being, nothing will be given in which to distinguish the perfect beings from one another. It is impossible, therefore, that there be many gods.

[4] Again, that which is accomplished adequately through one supposition is better done through one than through many. But the order of things is the best it can be, since the power of the first cause does not fail the potency in things for perfection. Now, all things are sufficiently fulfilled by a reduction to one first principle. There is, therefore, no need to posit many principles.

[5] Moreover, it is impossible that there be one continuous and regular motion from many movers. For, if they move together, none of them is a perfect mover, but all together rather take the place of one perfect mover. This is not befitting in the first mover, for the perfect is prior to the imperfect. If, however, they do not move together, each of them at times moves and at times does not. It follows from this that motion is neither continuous nor regular. For a motion that is continuous and one is from one mover. Furthermore, a mover that is not always moving is found to move irregularly, as is evident among lesser movers among whom a violent motion is stronger in the beginning and weaker at the end, whereas a natural motion proceeds conversely. But, as the philosophers have proved, the first motion is one and continuous. Therefore, its first mover must be one.

[6] Furthermore, a corporeal substance is ordered to a spiritual substance as to its good. For there is in the spiritual substance a fuller goodness to which the corporeal substance seeks to liken itself, since whatever exists desires the best so far as this is possible. But all the motions of the corporeal creature are seen to be reduced to one first motion, beyond which there is no other first motion that is not in some way reduced to it. Therefore, outside the spiritual substance that is the end of the first motion, there is none that is not reduced to it. But this is what we understand by the name of God. Hence, there is only one God.

[7] Among all the things that are ordered to one another, furthermore, their order to one another is for the sake of their order to something one; just as the order of the parts of an army among themselves is for the sake of the order of the whole army to its general. For that some diverse things should be united by some relationship cannot come about from their own natures as diverse things, since on this basis they would rather be distinguished from one another. Nor can this unity come from diverse ordering causes, because they could not possibly intend one order in so far as among themselves they are diverse. Thus, either the order of many to one another is accidental, or we must reduce it to some one first ordering cause that orders all other things to the end it intends. Now, we find that all the parts of this world are ordered to one another according as some things help some other things. Thus, lower bodies are moved by higher bodies, and these by incorporeal substances, as appears from what was said above. Nor is this something accidental, since it takes place always or for the most part. Therefore, this whole world has only one ordering cause and governor. But there is no other world beyond this one. Hence, there is only one governor for all things, whom we call God.

[8] Then, too, if there are two beings of which both are necessary beings, they must agree in the notion of the necessity of being. Hence, they must be distinguished by something added either to one of them only, or to both. This means that one or both of them must be composite. Now, as we have shown, no composite being is through itself a necessary being. It is impossible therefore that there be many beings of which each is a necessary being. Hence, neither can there be many gods.

[9] Furthermore, given two gods that are posited as agreeing in the necessity of being, either that in which they differ is in some way required for the completion of their necessity of being, or it is not. If it is not, then it is something accidental, because that which accrues to a thing without contributing to its being is an accident. Hence, this accident has a cause, which is, consequently, either the essence of the necessary being or something else. If its essence, then, since the necessity itself of being is its essence, as is evident from what was said above, the necessity of being will be the cause of that accident. But the necessity of being is found in both gods. Therefore, both will have that accident, and thus will not be distinguished with reference to it. If, however, the cause of the accident is something else, it follows that, unless that something else existed, this accident would not exist; and unless this accident existed, the aforesaid distinction would not exist. Therefore, unless that something else existed, these two supposed necessary beings would not be two but one. Therefore, the proper being of each depends on the other, and thus neither of them is through itself a necessary being.

[10] If, however, that in which they are distinguished is required to complete the necessity of their being, either this will be because it is included in the nature of this necessity of being, as animate is included in the definition of animal, or this will be because their necessity of being is specified by it, as animal is completed by rational. If the first is the case, wherever the necessity of being is found there must be present that which is included in its nature, just as animate belongs to whatever being to which animal belongs. And thus, since the necessity of being is attributed to both the aforementioned beings, they will not thereby be distinguished. If the second is the case, this too is impossible. A difference specifying a genus does not complete the nature of the genus, but rather through it the genus comes to be in act. For the nature of animal is complete before the addition of rational. Rather, the fact is that there cannot be an animal in act that is not rational or irrational. Thus, therefore, something completes the necessity of being as to being in act, and not as to the notion of the necessity of being. This is impossible on two counts. First, because the quiddity of a necessary being is its being, as was proved above. Second, because, were it true, the necessary being would acquire being through something else, which is impossible.

[11] It is, therefore, not possible to posit many beings of which each is through itself a necessary being.

[12] What is more, if there are two gods, either the name God is predicated of both univocally, or equivocally. If equivocally, this is outside our present purpose. Nothing prevents any given thing from being equivocally named by any given name, provided we admit the usage of those who express the name. But if it be used univocally, it must be predicated of both according to one notion, which means that, in notion, there must be in both one nature. Either, therefore, this nature is in both according to one being, or according to a being that is other in each case. If according to one, there will not be two gods, but only one, since there cannot be one being for two things that are substantially distinguished. If each has its own being, therefore in neither being will the quiddity be its being. Yet this must be posited in God, as we have proved. Therefore, neither of these two beings is what we understand by the name God. It is, therefore, impossible to posit two gods.

[13] Again, nothing that belongs to this designated thing as such can belong to another, for the singularity of some thing belongs to none other than to that singular thing. But its necessity of being belongs to the necessary being so far as it is this designated being. Therefore, it cannot belong to another, and therefore there cannot be several beings of which each is a necessary being. It is, consequently, impossible that there be several gods.

[14] The proof of the minor. If the necessary being is not this designated being as a necessary being, the designation of its being is not necessary through itself but depends on another. But so far as each thing is in act it is distinct from all other things; this is to be this designated thing. Therefore, the necessary being depends on another to be in act; which is against the nature of the necessary being. Therefore, the necessary being must be necessary according as it is this designated being.

[15] Furthermore, either the nature signified by the name God is individuated through itself in this God, or it is individuated through something else. If through something else, composition must result. If through itself, then it cannot possibly belong to another, since the principle of individuation cannot be common to several, It is impossible, therefore, that there be several gods.

[16] If, again, there are several gods, the nature of the godhead cannot be numerically one in two of them. There must, therefore, be something distinguishing the divine nature in this and in that god. But this is impossible, because, as we have shown above, the divine nature receives the addition neither of essential differences nor of accidents. Nor yet is the divine nature the form of any matter, to be capable of being divided according to the division of matter. It is impossible, therefore, that there be two gods.

[17] Then, too, the proper being of each thing is only one. But God is His being, as we have shown. There can, therefore, be only one God.

[18] Moreover, a thing has being in the manner it possesses unity. Hence, each thing struggles as much as it can against any division of itself, lest thereby it tend to nonbeing. But the divine nature has being most powerfully. There is therefore, in it the greatest unity, and hence no plurality is in any way distinguished within it.

[19] Furthermore, we notice in each genus that multitude proceeds from some unity. This is why in every genus there is found a prime member that is the measure of all the things found in that genus. In whatever things, therefore, we find that there is an agreement in one respect, it is necessary that this depend upon one source. But all things agree in being. There must, therefore, be only one being that is the source of all things. This is God.

[20] Again, in every rulership he who rules desires unity. That is why among the forms of rulership the main one is monarchy or kingship. So, too, for many members there is one head, whereby we see by an evident sign that he to whom rulership belongs should have unity. Hence, we must admit that God, Who is the cause of all things, is absolutely one.

[21] This confession of the divine unity we can likewise gather from holy Scripture. For it is said in Deuteronomy (6:4): “Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one God”; and in Exodus (20:3): “You shall not have strange gods before Me”; and in Ephesians (4:5): “One Lord, one faith, one baptism.”

[22] Now by this truth are refuted those Gentiles who accepted a multitude of gods. However, many of them said that there was one highest God, by whom all the others whom they named gods were according to them caused. For they attributed the name of divinity to all everlasting substances, and this especially because of their wisdom and felicity and the rulership of things. This manner of speaking is found also in Sacred Scripture, in which the holy angels, or even men, or judges, are called gods. Thus, this verse of the Psalms (85:8): “There is none among the gods like You, O Lord”; and elsewhere: “I have said: You are gods” (Ps. 81:6). Many such expressions are found in different places in Scripture.

[23] Hence, it is mainly the Manicheans who seem opposed to this truth, in that they posit two first principles of which one is not the cause of the other.

[24] The Arians likewise attacked this truth by their errors, in confessing that the Father and the Son are not one but several gods; although the authority of Scripture forces e to believe that the Son is true God.



Chapter 43

THAT GOD IS INFINITE

[1] Since, as the philosophers teach, “the infinite accompanies quantity,” infinity cannot be attributed to God on the ground of multitude. For we have shown that there is only one God and that no composition of parts or accidents is found in Him. Nor, again, according to continuous quantity can God be called infinite, since we have shown that He is incorporeal. It remains, then, to investigate whether according to spiritual magnitude it befits God to be infinite.

[2] We speak of spiritual magnitude with reference to two points: namely, power and the goodness or completeness of one’s own nature. For something is said to be more or less white according to the mode in which its whiteness is completed. The magnitude of its power likewise is measured from the magnitude of its action or its works. Of these magnitudes one follows the other. For, from the fact that something is in act it is active, and hence the mode of the magnitude of its power is according to the mode in which it is completed in its act. Thus, it remains that spiritual beings are called great according to the mode of their completion. Augustine himself says that “in beings that are great but not in bulk, to be greater is the same as to be better.”

[3] We must therefore show that God is infinite according to the mode of this sort of magnitude. The infinite here will not be taken in the sense of privation, as in the case of dimensive or numerical quantity. For this quantity is of a nature to have a limit, so that such things are called infinites according as there is removed from them the limits they have by nature; which means that in their case the infinite designates an imperfection. But in God the infinite is understood only in a negative way, because there is no terminus or limit to His perfection: He is supremely perfect. It is thus that the infinite ought to be attributed to God.

[4] For everything that according to its nature is finite is determined to the nature of some genus. God, however, is not in any genus; His perfection, as was shown above, rather contains the perfections of all the genera. God is, therefore, infinite.

[5) Again, every act inhering in another is terminated by that in which it inheres, since what is in another is in it according to the mode of the receiver. Hence, an act that exists in nothing is terminated by nothing. Thus, if whiteness were self-existing, the perfection of whiteness in it would not be terminated so as not to have whatever can be had of the perfection of whiteness. But God is act in no way existing in another, for neither is He a form in matter, as we have proved, nor does His being inhere in some form or nature, since He is His own being, as was proved above. It remains, then, that God is infinite.

[6] Furthermore, in reality we find something that is potency alone, namely, prime matter, something that is act alone, namely, God, as was shown above, and something that is act and potency, namely, the rest of things. But, since potency is said relatively to act, it cannot exceed act either in a particular case or absolutely. Hence, since prime matter is infinite in its potentiality, it remains that God, Who is pure act, is infinite in His actuality.

[7] Moreover, an act is all the more perfect by as much as it has less of potency mixed with it. Hence, every act with which potency is mixed is terminated in its perfection. But, as was shown above, God is pure act without any potency. He is, therefore, infinite.

[8] Again, considered absolutely, being is infinite, since there are infinite and infinite modes in which it can be participated. If, then, the being of some thing is finite, that being must be limited by something other that is somehow its cause. But there can be no cause of the divine being, for God is a necessary being through Himself. Therefore, His being is infinite, and so is He.

[9] Then, too, what has a certain perfection is the more perfect as it participates in that perfection more fully. But there cannot be a mode of perfection, nor is one thinkable, by which a given perfection is possessed more fully than it is possessed by the being that is perfect through its essence and whose being is its goodness. In no way, therefore, is it possible to think of anything better or more perfect than God. Hence, God is infinite in goodness.

[10] Our intellect, furthermore, extends to the infinite in understanding; and a sign of this is that, given any finite quantity, our intellect can think of a greater one. But this ordination of the intellect would be in vain unless an infinite intelligible reality existed. There must, therefore, be some infinite intelligible reality, which must be the greatest of beings. This we call God. God is, therefore, infinite.

[11] Again, an effect cannot transcend its cause. But our intellect can be only from God, Who is the first cause of all things. Our intellect, therefore, cannot think of anything greater than God. If, then, it can think of something greater than every finite thing, it remains that God is not finite.

[12] There is also the argument that an infinite power cannot reside in a finite essence. For each thing acts through its form, which is either its essence or a part of the essence, whereas power is the name of a principle of action. But God does not have a finite active power. For He moves in an infinite time, which can be done only by an infinite power, as we have proved above. It remains, then, that God’s essence is infinite.

[13] This argument, however, is according to those who posit the eternity of the world. If we do not posit it, there is all the greater confirmation for the view that the power of God is infinite. For each agent is the more powerful in acting according as it reduces to act a potency more removed from act; just as a greater power is needed to heat water than air. But that which in no way exists is infinitely distant from act, nor is it in any way in potency. If, then, the world was made after previously not being at all, the power of its maker must be infinite.

[14] This argument holds in proving the infinity of the divine power even according to those who posit the eternity of the world. For they acknowledge that God is the cause of the substance of the world, though they consider this substance to be everlasting. They say that God is the cause of an everlasting world in the same way as a foot would have been the cause of an imprint if it had been pressed on sand from all eternity. If we adopt this position, according to our previous argumentation it still follows that the power of God is infinite. For, whether God produced things in time, as we hold, or from all eternity, according to them, nothing can be in reality that God did not produce; for God is the universal source of being. Thus, God produced the world without the supposition of any pre-existent matter or potency. Now, we must gather the proportion of an active power according to the proportion of a passive potency, for the greater the potency that preexists or is presupposed, by so much the greater active power will it be brought to actual fulfillment. It remains, therefore, that, since a finite power produces a given effect by presupposing the potency of matter, the power of God, which presupposes no potency, is infinite, not finite. Thus, so is His essence infinite.

[15] Each thing, moreover, is more enduring according as its cause is more efficacious. Hence, that being whose duration is infinite must have been from a cause of infinite efficaciousness. But the duration of God is infinite, for we have shown above that He is eternal. Since, then, He has no other cause of His being than Himself, He must be infinite.

[16] The authority of Sacred Scripture is witness to this truth. For the psalmist says: “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: and of His greatness there is no end” (Ps. 144:3).

[17] The sayings of the most ancient philosophers are likewise a witness to this truth. They all posited an infinite first principle of things, as though compelled by truth itself.” Yet they did not recognize their own voice. They judged the infinity of the first principle in terms of discrete quantity, following Democritus, who posited infinite atoms as the principles of things, and also Anaxagoras, who posited infinite similar parts as the principles of things. Or they judged infinity in terms of continuous quantity, following those who posited that the first principle of all things was some element or a confused infinite body. But, since it was shown by the effort of later philosophers that there is no infinite body, given that there must be a first principle that is in some way infinite, we conclude that the infinite which is the first principle is neither a body nor a power in a body.



Chapter 44

THAT GOD IS INTELLIGENT

[1] From what has been said we can show that God is intelligent.

[2] We have shown above that among movers and things moved we cannot proceed to infinity, but must reduce all movable things, as is demonstrable, to one first self-moving being. The self-moving being moves itself only by appetite and knowledge, for only such beings are found to move themselves, because to be moved and not moved lies in their power. The moving part in the first self-moving being must he appetitive and apprehending. Now, in a motion that takes place through appetite and apprehension, he who has the appetite and the apprehension is a moved mover, while the appetible and apprehended is the unmoved mover. Since, therefore, the first mover of all things, whom we call God, is an absolutely unmoved mover, He must be related to the mover that is a part of the self-moving being as the appetible is to the one who has the appetite. Not, however, as something appetible by sensible appetite, since sensible appetite is not of that which is good absolutely but of this particular good, since the apprehension of the sense is likewise particular; whereas that which is good and appetible absolutely is prior to that which is good and appetible here and now. The first mover, then, must be appetible as an object of intellect, and thus the mover that desires it must be intelligent. All the more, therefore, will the first appetible be intelligent, since the one desiring it is intelligent in act by being joined to it as an intelligible. Therefore, making the supposition that the first mover moves himself, as the philosophers intended, we must say that God is intelligent.

[3] Moreover, the same conclusion must follow if the reduction of movable beings is, not to a first self-moving being, but to an absolutely unmoved mover. For the first mover is the universal source of motion. Therefore, since every mover moves through a form at which it aims in moving, the form through which the first mover moves must be a universal form and a universal good. But a form does not have a universal mode except in the intellect. Consequently, the first mover, God, must be intelligent.

[4] In no order of movers, furthermore, is it the case that an intellectual mover is the instrument of a mover without an intellect. Rather, the converse is true. But all movers in the world are to the first mover, God, as instruments are related to a principal agent. Since, then, there are in the world many movers endowed with intelligence, it is impossible that the first mover move without an intellect. Therefore, God must be intelligent.

[5] Again, a thing is intelligent because it is without matter. A sign of this is the fact that forms are made understood in act by abstraction from matter. And hence the intellect deals with universals and not singulars, for matter is the principle of individuation. But forms that are understood in act become one with the intellect that understands them in act. Therefore, if forms are understood in act because they are without matter, a thing must be intelligent because it is without matter. But we have shown that God is absolutely immaterial. God is, therefore, intelligent.

[6] Then, too, as was shown above, no perfection found in any genus of things is lacking to God. Nor on this account does any composition follow in Him. But among the perfections; of things the greatest is that something be intelligent, for thereby it is in a manner all things, having within itself the perfections of all things. God is, therefore, intelligent.

[7] Again, that which tends determinately to some end either has set itself that end or the end has been set for it by another. Otherwise, it would tend no more to this end than to that. Now, natural things tend to determinate ends. They do not fulfill their natural needs by chance, since they would not do so always or for the most part, but rarely, which is the domain of chance. Since, then, things do not set for themselves an end, because they have no notion of what an end is, the end must be set for them by another, who is the author of nature. He it is who gives being to all things and is through Himself the necessary being. We call Him God, as is clear from what we have said. But God could not set an end for nature unless He had understanding. God is, therefore, intelligent.

[8] Furthermore, everything imperfect derives from something perfect; for the perfect is naturally prior to the imperfect, as is act to potency. But the forms found in particular things are imperfect because they are there in a particular way and not according to the community of their natures. They must therefore be derived from some forms that are perfect and not particular. But such forms cannot exist unless by being understood, since no form is found in its universality except in the intellect. Consequently, these forms must be intelligent, if they be subsistent; for only thus do they have operation. God, then, Who is the first subsistent act, from whom all other things are derived, must be intelligent.

[9] This truth the Catholic faith likewise confesses. For it is said of God in Job (9:4): “He is wise of heart, and mighty in strength”; and later on (12:16): “With Him is strength and wisdom.” So, too, in the Psalms (138:6): “Your knowledge has become wonderful to me”; and Romans (21:33): “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God.”

[10] The truth of this faith was so strong among men that they named God from the act of understanding. For theos [θεος], which among the Greeks signifies God, comes from theaste [θεασθαι], which means to consider or to see.



Chapter 45

THAT GOD’S ACT OF U11MERSTAMING IS HIS ESSENCE

[1] From the fact that God is intelligent it follows that His act of understanding is His essence.

[2] To understand is the act of one understanding, residing in him, not proceeding to something outside as heating proceeds to the heated thing. For, by being understood, the intelligible suffers nothing; rather, the one understanding is perfected. Now, whatever is in God is the divine essence. God’s act of understanding, therefore, is His essence, it is the divine being, God Himself. For God is His essence and His being.

[3] Furthermore, the act of understanding is to the intellect as being [esse] is to essence [essentia]. But, as we have proved, God’s being is His essence. Therefore, God’s understanding is His intellect. But the divine intellect is God’s essence; otherwise, it would be an accident in God. Therefore, the divine understanding is His essence.

[4] Again, second act is more perfect than first act, as consideration is more perfect than knowledge. But the knowledge or intellect of God is His essence, if, as we have proved, He is intelligent; for, as is clear from the above, no perfection belongs to Him by participation but rather by essence. If, therefore, His consideration is not His essence, something will be nobler and more perfect than His essence. Thus, God will not be at the summit of perfection and goodness and hence will not be first.

[5] Moreover, to understand is the act of the one understanding. If, therefore, God in understanding is not His understanding, God must be related to it as potency to act. Thus, there will be potency and act in God, which is impossible, as we proved above.

[6] Then, too, every substance exists for the sake of its operation. If, then, the operation of God is other than the divine substance, the end of God will be something other than God. Thus, God will not be His goodness, since the good of each thing is its end.

[7] If, however, God’s understanding is His being, His understanding must be simple, eternal and unchangeable, existing only in act, and including all the perfections that have been proved of the divine being. Hence, God is not potentially understanding, nor does He begin to understand something anew, nor still does He have any change or composition in understanding.



Chapter 46

THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS THROUGH NOTHING OTHER THAN THROUGH HIS ESSENCE

[1] From what has been shown above it appears with evidence that the divine intellect understands through no other intelligible species than through His essence.

[2] The intelligible species is the formal principle of intellectual operation, just as the form of any agent is the principle of its own operation. Now, as we have shown, the divine intellectual operation is God’s essence. If, then, the divine intellect understood by an intelligible species other than the divine essence, something other would be added to the divine essence as principle and cause. This is opposed to what was shown above.

[3] Furthermore, the intellect becomes understanding in act through an intelligible species, just as the sense becomes sensing in act through a sensible species. The intelligible species is to the intellect, therefore, as act to potency. If, then, the divine intellect understood through some intelligible species other than itself, it would be in potency with respect to something. This is impossible, as we proved above.

[4] Moreover, an intelligible species in the intellect that is other than the intellect’s essence has an accidental being, which is why our knowledge is numbered among the accidents. But in God, as we have shown, there can be no accident. Therefore, there is not in the divine intellect any species other than the divine essence itself.

[5] Again, the intelligible species is the likeness of something understood. If, then, there is in the divine intellect an intelligible species other than the divine essence, it will be the likeness of something understood. It will thus be the likeness either of the divine essence or of some other thing. It cannot be the likeness of the divine essence, because then the divine essence would not be intelligible through itself, but that species would make it intelligible. Nor can there be in the divine intellect a species other than the divine intellect that is the likeness of some other being. For that likeness would then be impressed on the divine intellect by some being. Not by itself, since then the same being would be agent and receiver, and also because there would be an agent that impressed, not its own likeness, but that of another on the receiver, and thus it would not be true that every agent produced its like. Nor by another, for there would then be an agent prior to God. It is, therefore, impossible that there be in God an intelligible species other than His essence.

[6] Furthermore, God’s understanding, as we have shown, is His essence. If, therefore, God understood through a species that was not His essence, it would be through something other than His essence. This is impossible. Therefore, God does not understand through a species that is not His essence.



Chapter 47

THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS HIMSELF PERFECTLY

[1] From this it further appears that God understands Himself perfectly.

[2] Since through the intelligible species the intellect is directed to the thing understood, the perfection of intellectual operation depends on two things. One is that the intelligible species be perfectly conformed to the thing understood. The second is that it be perfectly joined to the intellect, which is realized more fully according as the intellect has greater power in understanding. Now, the divine essence, which is the intelligible species by which the divine intellect understands, is absolutely identical with God and it is also absolutely identical with His intellect. Therefore, God understands Himself most perfectly.

[3] Furthermore, a material thing is made intelligible by being separated from matter and the conditions of matter. Therefore, that which is through its nature separate from all matter and material conditions is intelligible in its nature. Now every intelligible is understood by being one in act with the one understanding. But, as we have proved, God is intelligent. Therefore, since He is absolutely immaterial, and most one with Himself, He understands Himself perfectly.

[4] Again, a thing is Understood in act because the intellect in act and the understood in act are one. But the divine intellect is always an intellect in act, since there is no potency or imperfection in God. On the other hand, the divine essence is through itself perfectly intelligible, as is clear from what we have said. Since, therefore, the divine intellect and the divine essence are one, it is evident from what we have said that God understands Himself perfectly. For God is His intellect and His essence.

[5] Moreover, what is in something in an intelligible way is understood by it. The divine essence is in God in an intelligible way, for the natural being of God and His intelligible being are one and the same, since His being is His understanding. God, therefore, understands His essence, and hence Himself, since He is His essence.

[6] The acts of the intellect, furthermore, like those of the other powers of the soul, are distinguished according to their objects. The operation of the intellect will be more perfect as the intelligible object is more perfect. But the most perfect intelligible object is the divine essence, since it is the most perfect and the first truth. The operation of the divine intellect is likewise the most noble, since, as we have shown, it is the divine being. Therefore, God understands Himself.

[7] Again, the perfections of all things are found supremely in God. Now, among other perfections found in created things the greatest is to understand God. For the intellectual nature, whose perfection is understanding, excels all the others; and the most noble intelligible object is God. God, therefore, knows Himself supremely.

[8] This is confirmed by divine authority. For the Apostle says: “The spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God” (1 Cor. 2:10).



Chapter 48

THAT PRIMARILY AND ESSENTIALLY GOD KNOWS ONLY HIMSELF

[1] Now, it appears from what we have said that primarily. and essentially God knows only Himself.

[2] That thing alone is primarily and essentially known by the intellect by whose species the intellect understands; for an operation is proportioned to the form that is the principle of the operation. But, as we have proved, that by which God understands is nothing other than His essence. Therefore, the primary and essential object of His intellect is nothing other than Himself.

[3] It is, furthermore, impossible to understand a multitude primarily and essentially, since one operation cannot be terminated by many. But, as we have proved, God at some time understands Himself. If, therefore, He understands something other than Himself as the primary and essential object of His understanding, His intellect must change from a consideration of Himself to the consideration of this something else. This something else is less noble than God. The divine intellect is thus changed for the worse, which is impossible.

[4] Moreover, the operations of the intellect are distinguished according to their objects. If, then, God understands Himself and something other than Himself as the principal object, He will have several intellectual operations. Therefore, either His essence will be divided into several parts, or He will have an intellectual operation that is not His substance. Both of these positions have been proved to be impossible. It remains, then, that nothing other than the divine essence is known by God as the primary and essential object of His intellect.

[5] Again, in so far as the intellect is different from its object, it is in potency to it. If, then, something other than Himself is God's primary and essential object, it will follow that He is in potency to something else. This is impossible, as is clear from what we have said.



[6] The thing understood, likewise, is the perfection of the one understanding. For the intellect is perfect according as it understands in act, and this obtains through the fact that the intellect is one with what is understood. If, then, something other than Himself is primarily understood by God, something else will be His perfection, and more noble than He. This is impossible.

[7] Furthermore, the knowledge of the one understanding is comprised of many things understood. If, then, God knows many things as the principal and essential objects of His knowledge, it will follow that the knowledge of God is composed of many things. Thus, either the divine essence will be composite, or knowledge will be an accident in God. From what we have said, it is clear that both of these suppositions are impossible. It remains, therefore, that what is primarily and essentially understood by God is nothing other than His substance.

[8] Again, intellectual operation derives its specification and nobility from that which is essentially and primarily understood by it. If, then, God understood something other than Himself as His essential and primary object, His intellectual operation would have its specification and nobility according to something other than God. This, however, is impossible, since, as we have shown, God’s operation is His essence. Thus, it is impossible that what is understood primarily and essentially by God be other than He.



Chapter 49

THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS THINGS OTHER THAN HIMSELF

[1] From the fact that God understands Himself primarily and essentially we must posit that He knows in Himself things other than Himself.

[2] An effect is adequately known when its cause is known. So “we are said to know each thing when we know the cause.” But God Himself is through His essence the cause of being for other things. Since He has a most full knowledge of His essence, we must posit that God also knows other things.

[3] Moreover, the likeness of every effect somehow preexists in its cause; for every agent produces its like. But whatever is in something is in it according to the mode of that in which it is. If, then, God is the cause of certain things, since according to His nature He is intellectual, the likeness of what He causes will exist in Him in an intelligible way. But what is in something in an intelligible way is understood by it. God, therefore, understands within Himself things other than Himself.

[4] Again, whoever knows perfectly a given thing knows whatever can be truly said of it and whatever befits it according to its nature. But it befits God according to His nature to be the cause of other things. Since, then, God knows Himself perfectly, He knows Himself to be a cause. This cannot be unless He somehow knows what He causes. This is other than He, since nothing is the cause of itself. Therefore, God knows things other than Himself.

[5] If we put together these two conclusions, it appears that God knows Himself as primarily and essentially known, whereas He knows other things as seen in His essence.

[6] This truth is expressly taught by Dionysius. He says: “In seeing them, God does not insert Himself in singulars, but He knows them as contained within a single cause” [De dev. nom. VII, 2]. And later on: “the divine wisdom, knowing itself, knows other things.”

[7] To this judgment, too, the authority of Sacred Scripture bears witness. For it is said of God in the Psalms (101:20): “He looked forth from His high sanctuary”; as though to say that God sees other things from His own height.



Chapter 50

THAT GOD HAS A PROPER KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS

[1] Some have said that God has only a universal knowledge of other things. He knows them, that is, in so far as they are beings because He knows the nature of being through a knowledge of Himself. For this reason, it remains for us to show that God knows all other things as they are distinct from one another and from Himself. This is to know things according to their proper natures.

[2] In order to show this point, let us suppose that God is the cause of every being, as is somewhat evident from what we said above and will be more fully shown later on. Thus, there is consequently nothing in any thing that is not caused by God, mediately or immediately. Now, when the cause is known, the effect is known. Whatever is in each and every thing can be known if we know God and all the causes that are between God and things. But God knows Himself and all the intervening causes between Himself and any given thing. Now, we have already shown that God knows Himself perfectly. By knowing Himself, God knows whatever proceeds from Him immediately. When this is known, God once more knows what proceeds from it immediately; and so on for all intermediate causes down to the last effect. Therefore, God knows whatever is found in reality. But this is to have a proper and complete knowledge of a thing, namely, to know all that there is in that thing, both what is common and what is proper. Therefore, God has a proper knowledge of things, in so far as they are distinct from one another.

[3] Furthermore, whatever acts through an intellect knows what it does according to the proper nature of its work; for the knowledge of the maker determines the form for the thing made. Now, God causes things through His intellect, since His being is His understanding and each thing acts in so far as it is in act. God, therefore, has a proper knowledge of what He causes, so far as it is distinct from the others.

[4] Moreover, the distinction of things cannot be from chance, because it has a fixed order. The distinction in things must therefore be from the intention of some cause. It cannot be from the intention of a cause acting through a necessity of nature, for nature is determined to one course of action, and thus the intention of no thing acting through the necessity of nature can terminate in many effects in so far as these are distinct. It remains, then, that distinction in things comes from the intention of a knowing cause. But it seems to be proper to the intellect to consider the distinction of things; and so Anaxagoras called the intellect the source of distinction. Now, the universal distinction of things cannot be from the intention of some secondary cause, because all such causes belong to the world of distinct effects. It belongs to the first cause, that is through itself distinguished from all other things, to aim at the distinction of all things. God, therefore, knows things as distinct.

[5] Again, whatever God knows He knows most perfectly. For, as was shown above, there is all perfection in God as in the absolutely perfect being. Now, what is known only in a general way is not perfectly known, since one does not yet know what is most important in that thing, namely, the ultimate perfections, by which its proper being is completed; so that by such a knowledge a thing is known potentially rather than actually. Since, then, by knowing His own essence God knows things in a universal way, He must also have a proper knowledge of things.

[6] Then, too, whoever knows a certain nature knows the essential accidents of that nature. The essential accidents of being as being are one and many, as is proved in Metaphysics IV [3]. If, then, by knowing His essence, God knows the nature of being in a universal way, it follows that He knows multitude. But multitude cannot be understood without distinction. Therefore, God knows things as they are distinct from one another.

[7] Whoever, furthermore, perfectly knows a universal nature knows the mode in which that nature can be possessed. In the same way, he who knows whiteness knows that which receives it more and less. But the grades of beings are established from the diverse mode of being. If, then, by knowing Himself, God knows the universal nature of being, and this not imperfectly, since, as we have shown, every imperfection is remote from Him, God must know all grades of beings. Thus, God will have a proper knowledge of things other than Himself.

[8] Furthermore, he who knows something perfectly knows all that is in it. But God knows Himself perfectly. Therefore, He knows all that is in Him according to His active power. But all things, in their proper forms, are in Him according to His active power, since God is the principle of every being. Therefore, God has a proper knowledge of all things.

[9] Again, he who knows a certain nature knows whether that nature is communicable. He who did not know that the nature of animal is communicable to many would not know it perfectly. Now, the divine nature is communicable by likeness. God, therefore, knows in how many modes there can be something like His essence. But the diversities of forms arise from the fact that things imitate the divine essence diversely; and so the Philosopher has called a natural form “something divine.” Therefore, God has a knowledge of things in terms of their proper forms.

[10] Moreover, men and other knowing beings know things as distinct from one another in their multitude. If, then, God does not know things in their distinction, it follows that He is the most foolish being of all, as He must have been for those who held that God did not know strife, a thing known to all-an opinion that the Philosopher considers to be untenable in De anima I [5]and Metaphysics III [4].

[11] We likewise receive this teaching from the canonic Scriptures. For it is said in Genesis (1:31): “And God saw all things that He had made, and they were very good.” And in Hebrews (4:13): “Neither is there any creature invisible in His sight: but all things are naked and open to His eyes.”



Chapters 51-52

ARGUMENTS INQUIRING HOW A MULTITUDE OF INTELLECTUAL OBJECTS IS IN THE DIVINE INTELLECT

[1] Lest the multitude of intellectual objects, however, introduce a composition into the divine intellect, we must investigate the mode in which these intellectual objects are many.

[2.] Now, this multitude cannot be taken to mean that many intellectual objects have a distinct being in God. For either these objects would be the same as the divine essence, and thus a certain multitude would be posited in the essence of God, which we set aside above in many ways; or they would be added to the divine essence, and thus there would be some accident in God, which we have shown above to be impossible.

[3] Nor, again, can such intelligible forms be posited as existing in themselves. This is what Plato, avoiding the above difficulties, seems to have posited by introducing the Ideas. For the forms of natural things cannot exist without matter, since neither are they understood without matter.

[4] And, even if this position were held, it would not enable us to posit that God has understanding of a multitude. For, since the aforementioned forms are outside God’s essence, if God could not understand the multitude of things without them, as the perfection of His intellect requires, it would follow that His perfection in understanding depended on something else, and consequently so would His perfection in being, since His being is His understanding. The contrary of this was shown above.

[5] Furthermore, since whatever is outside His essence must be caused by Him, as will be shown later on it is necessary that, if the aforementioned forms are to be found outside God, they must be caused by Him. But God is the cause of things through His intellect, as will be shown later on. Therefore, so that these intelligibles may have existence, it is required according to the order of nature that God first understand them. Hence, God does not have knowledge of multitude by the fact that many intelligibles are found outside Him.

[6] Furthermore, the intelligible in act is the intellect in act, just as the sensible in act is the sense in act. According as the intelligible is distinguished from the intellect, both are in potency, as likewise appears in the case of the sense. For neither the sight is seeing in act, nor is the visible object seen in act, except when the sight is informed by the species of the visible object, so that thereby from the sight and the object something one results. If, then, the intelligible objects of God are outside His intellect, it will follow that His intellect is in potency, as are also its intelligible objects. Thus, some cause reducing them to act would be needed, which is impossible, since there is nothing prior to God.

[7] Then, too, the understood must be in him who understands. Therefore, to posit the forms of things as existing in themselves outside the divine intellect does not suffice for God to understand a multitude of things; these intelligibles must be in the divine intellect itself.

[8] [Chapter 52] From the same arguments it likewise appears that the multitude of the aforementioned intelligibles cannot reside in any intellect other than the divine intellect—for example, that of a soul or an angel or intelligence. If this were true, the divine intellect would depend on a lower intellect for some operation. But this is impossible.

[9] Then, too, just as self-subsisting things are from God, so is whatever inheres in them. Hence, the divine understanding, by which God is a cause, is a prerequisite for the being of the aforementioned intelligibles in some lower intellect.

[10] It likewise follows that the divine intellect is in potency, since its intelligible objects are not joined to it.

[11] Furthermore, just as each thing has its own being, so it has its own operation. It cannot happen, then, that because some intellect is disposed for operation another intellect will perform an intellectual operation; rather, the very same intellect in which the disposition is present will do this, just as each thing is through its own essence, not through the essence of another. Therefore, by the fact that there are many intelligible objects in some secondary intellect it could not come about that the first intellect knows a multitude.



Chapter 53

THE SOLUTION OF THE ABOVE DIFFICULTY

[1] We can solve the above difficulty with ease if we examine diligently how the things that are understood by the intellect exist within the intellect.

[2] So far as it is possible, let us proceed from our intellect to the knowledge that the divine intellect has. Let us consider the fact that an external thing understood by us does not exist in our intellect according to its own nature; rather, it is necessary that its species be in our intellect, and through this species the intellect comes to be in act. Once in act through this species as through its own form, the intellect knows the thing itself. This is not to be understood in the sense that the act itself of understanding is an action proceeding to the thing understood, as heating proceeds to the heated thing. Understanding remains in the one understanding, but it is related to the thing understood because the abovementioned species, which is a principle of intellectual operation as a form, is the likeness of the thing understood.

[3] We must further consider that the intellect, having been informed by the species of the thing, by an act of understanding forms within itself a certain intention of the thing understood, that is to say, its notion, which the definition signifies. This is a necessary point, because the intellect understands a present and an absent thing indifferently. In this the imagination agrees with the intellect. But the intellect has this characteristic in addition, namely, that it understands a thing as separated from material conditions, without which a thing does not exist in reality. But this could not take place unless the intellect formed the abovementioned intention for itself.

[4] Now, since this understood intention is, as it were, a terminus of intelligible operation, it is distinct from the intelligible species that actualizes the intellect, and that we must consider the principle of intellectual operation, though both are a likeness of the thing understood. For, by the fact that the intelligible species, which is the form of the intellect and the principle of understanding, is the likeness of the external thing, it follows that the intellect forms an intention like that thing, since such as a thing is, such are its works. And because the understood intention is like some thing, it follows that the intellect, by forming such an intention) knows that thing.

[5] Now, the divine intellect understands by no species other than the divine essence, as was shown above. Nevertheless, the divine essence is the likeness of all things. Thereby it follows that the conception of the divine intellect as understanding itself, which is its Word, is the likeness not only of God Himself understood, but also of all those things of which the divine essence is the likeness. In this way, therefore, through one intelligible species, which is the divine essence, and through one understood intention, which is the divine Word, God can understand many things.



Chapter 54

HOW THE DIVINE ESSENCE, BEING ONE AND SIMPLE, IS THE PROPER LIKENESS OF ALL INTELLIGIBLE OBJECTS

[1] But, again, it can seem to someone difficult or impossible that one and the same simple being, the divine essence for example, is the proper model or likeness of diverse things. For, since among diverse things there is a distinction by reason of their proper forms, whatever is like something according to its proper form must turn out to be unlike something else. To be sure, according as diverse things have something in common, nothing prevents them from having one likeness, as do man and a donkey so far as they are animals. But from this it will follow that God does not have a proper knowledge of things, but a common one; for the operation that knowledge is follows the mode in which the likeness of the known is in the knower. So, too, heating is according to the mode of the heat. For the likeness of the known in the knower is as the form by which the operation takes place. Therefore, if God has a proper knowledge of many things, He must be the proper model of singulars. How this may be we must investigate.

[2] As the Philosopher says in Metaphysics VIII [3], the forms of things and the definitions that signify them are like numbers. Among numbers, the addition or subtraction of unity changes the species of a number, as appears in the numbers two and three. It is the same among definitions: the addition or subtraction of one difference changes the species. For sensible substance, with the difference rational taken away and added, differs in species.

[3] Now, with reference to things that contain a multitude, the intellect and nature are differently disposed. For what is required for the being of something the nature of that thing does not permit to be removed. For the nature of an animal will not survive if the soul is taken away from the body. But what is joined in reality the intellect can at times receive separately, when one of the elements is not included in the notion of the other. Thus, in the number three the intellect can consider the number two only, and in the rational animal it can consider that which is sensible only. Hence, that which contains several elements the intellect can take as the proper notion of the several elements by apprehending one of them without the others. It can, for example, take the number ten as the proper notion of nine by subtracting unity, and similarly as the proper notion of each of the numbers included under it. So, too, it can take in man the proper exemplar of irrational animal as such, and of each of its species, except that they would add some positive differences. On this account a certain philosopher, Clement by name, said that the nobler beings in reality are the exemplars of the less noble [cf. Pseudo-Dionysius, De div. nom. V, 9].

[4] But the divine essence comprehends within itself the nobilities of all beings, not indeed compositely, but, as we have shown above, according to the mode of perfection. Now, every form, both proper and common, considered as positing something, is a certain perfection; it includes imperfection only to the extent that it falls short of true being. The intellect of God, therefore, can comprehend in His essence that which is proper to each thing by understanding wherein the divine essence is being imitated and wherein each thing falls short of its perfection. Thus, by understanding His essence as imitable in the mode of life and not of knowledge, God has the proper form of a plant; and if He knows His essence as imitable in the mode of knowledge and not of intellect, God has the proper form of animal, and so forth. Thus, it is clear that, being absolutely perfect, the divine essence can be taken as the proper exemplar of singulars. Through it, therefore, God can have a proper knowledge of all things.

[5] Since, however, the proper exemplar of one thing is distinguished from the proper exemplar of another thing, and distinction is the source of plurality, we must observe in the divine intellect a certain distinction and plurality of understood exemplars, according as that which is in the divine intellect is the proper exemplar of diverse things. Hence, since this obtains according as God understands the proper relation of resemblance that each creature has to Him, it remains that the exemplars of things in the divine intellect are many or distinct only according as God knows that things can be made to resemble Him by many and diverse modes. In accord with this, Augustine says that God made man and a horse by distinct exemplars. He also says that the exemplars of things are a plurality in the divine mind. This conclusion likewise saves to some extent the opinion of Plato and his doctrine of Ideas, according to which would be formed everything that is found among material things.



Chapter 55

THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS ALL THINGS TOGETHER

[1] From this it is further apparent that God understands all things together.

[2] Our intellect cannot understand in act many things together. The reason is that, since “the intellect in act is its object in act,” if the intellect did understand many things together, it would follow that the intellect would be at one and the same time many things according to one genus—which is impossible. I say “according to one genus” because nothing prevents the same subject from being informed by diverse forms of diverse genera, just as the same body is figured and colored. Now, the intelligible species, by which the intellect is formed so as to be the objects that are understood in act, all belong to one genus; for they have one manner of being in the order of intelligible being, even though the things whose species they are do not have one manner of being. Hence, the species are not contrary through the contrariety of the things that are outside the soul. It is in this way that, when certain things that are many are considered as in any way united, they are understood together. For the intellect understands a continuous whole all at once, not part after part. So, too, it understands a proposition all at once, not first the subject and then the predicate, since it knows all the parts according to one species of the whole.

[3] From these remarks we can infer that, whenever several things are known through one species, they can be known together. But all that God knows He knows through one species, which is His essence. Therefore, God can understand all things together.

[4] Again, a knowing power does not know anything in act unless the intention be present. Thus, the phantasms preserved in the organ are not always actually imagined because the intention is not directed to them. For among voluntary agents the appetite moves the other powers to act. We do not understand together, therefore, many things to which the intention is not directed at the same time. But things that must fall under one intention must be understood together; for he who is considering a comparison between two things directs his intention to both and sees both together.

[5] Now, all the things that are in the divine knowledge must fall under one intention. For God intends to see His essence perfectly, which is to see it according to its whole power, under which are contained all things. Therefore God, by seeing His essence, sees all things together.

[6] Furthermore, the intellect of one considering successively many things cannot have only one operation. For since operations differ according to their objects, the operation by which the first is considered must be different from the operation by which the second is considered. But the divine intellect has only one operation, namely, the divine essence, as we have proved. Therefore, God considers all that He knows, not successively, but together.

[7] Moreover, succession cannot be understood without time nor time without motion, since time is “the number of motion according to before and after.” But there can be no motion in God, as may be inferred from what we have said. There is, therefore, no succession in the divine consideration. Thus, all that He knows God considers together.

[8] Then, too, God’s understanding is His being, as is clear from what we have said. But there is no before and after in the divine being; everything is together, as was shown above. Neither, therefore, does the consideration of God contain a before and after, but, rather, understands all things together.

[9] Every intellect, furthermore, that understands one thing after the other is at one time potentially understanding and at another time actually understanding. For while it understands the first thing actually it understands the second thing potentially. But the divine intellect is never potentially, but always actually, understanding. Therefore, it does not understand things successively but rather understands them together.

[10] Sacred Scripture bears witness to this truth. For it is written: “With God there is no change nor shadow of alteration” (James 1:17).



Chapter 56

THAT GOD’S KNOWLEDGE IS NOT HABITUAL

[1] From this it appears that there is no habitual knowledge in God.

[2] Where there is habitual knowledge, not all things are known together; some are known actually, and some habitually. But, as we have proved, God has actual understanding of all things together. There is, therefore, no habitual knowledge in Him.

[3] Furthermore, he who has a habit and is not using it is in a manner in potency, though otherwise than prior to understanding. But we have shown that the divine intellect is in no way in potency. In no way, therefore, is there habitual knowledge in it.

[4] Moreover, if an intellect knows something habitually, its essence is other than its intellectual operation, which is the consideration itself. For an intellect that knows habitually is lacking its operation, but its essence cannot be lacking to it. In God, however, as we have proved, His essence is His operation. There is, therefore, no habitual knowledge in His intellect.

[5] Again, an intellect that knows only habitually is not at its highest perfection. That is why happiness, which is something best, is posited in terms of act, not in terms of habit. If, therefore, God is habitually knowing through His substance, considered in His substance He will not be universally perfect. We have shown the contrary of this conclusion.

[6] It has also been shown that God understands through His essence, but not through any intelligible species added to His essence. Now, every habitual intellect understands through some species. For either a habit confers on the intellect a certain ability to receive the intelligible species by which it becomes understanding in act, or else it is the ordered aggregate of the species themselves existing in the intellect, not according to a complete act, but in a way intermediate between potency and act. There is therefore no habitual knowledge in God.

[7] Then, again, a habit is a certain quality. But no quality or accident can be added to God, as we have proved. Habitual knowledge, therefore, does not befit God.

[8] But because the disposition by which one is only habitually considering or willing or doing is likened to the disposition of one sleeping, hence it is that, in order to remove any habitual disposition from God, David says: “Behold He neither slumbers nor sleeps, who keeps Israel” (Ps. 120:4). Hence, also, what is said in Sirach (23:28): “The eyes of the Lord are far brighter than the sun”; for the sun is always shining.



Chapter 57

THAT GOD’S KNOWLEDGE IS NOT DISCURSIVE

[1] We thereby further know that the divine consideration is not ratiocinative or discursive.

[2] Our consideration is ratiocinative when we proceed from the consideration of one thing to another, as when in syllogistic reasoning we proceed from principles to conclusions. For, when someone examines how a conclusion follows from premises and considers both together, he is not on this account reasoning or discoursing, since this takes place, not by arguing, but by judging the arguments. So, too, knowledge is not material because it judges material things. Now, it has been shown that God does not consider one thing after the other as it were in succession, but all together. His knowledge, therefore, is not ratiocinative or discursive, although He knows all discourse and ratiocination.

[3] Everyone reasoning sees the principle by one consideration and the conclusions by another. There would be no need to proceed to conclusions after the consideration of the principles if by considering the principles we also considered the conclusions. But God knows all things by one operation, His essence, as we proved above. His knowledge is, therefore, not ratiocinative.

[4] Again, all ratiocinative knowledge contains some potency and some act, for conclusions are in principles potentially. But in the divine intellect potency has no place, as was proved above. God’s intellect, therefore, is not discursive.

[5] Moreover, in all discursive knowledge there must be something caused, since principles are in a manner the efficient cause of the conclusion. Hence, demonstration is said to be “a syllogism making one to know.” But in the divine knowledge there can be nothing caused, since it is God Himself, as is clear from what has preceded. God’s knowledge, therefore, cannot be discursive.

[6] What is naturally known, furthermore, is known to us without ratiocination. But in God there can be only natural knowledge, indeed, only essential knowledge; for, as was proved above, His knowledge is His essence. God’s knowledge, therefore, is not ratiocinative.

[7] Again, every motion must be reduced to a first mover that is only mover and not moved. That from which the first motion originates, therefore, must be an absolutely unmoved mover. This, as was proved above, is the divine intellect. The divine intellect must, therefore, be an absolutely unmoved mover. But ratiocination is a certain motion of the intellect proceeding from one thing to another. Hence, the divine intellect is not ratiocinative.

[8] Then, too, what is highest in us is lower than what is in God, for the lower reaches the higher only in its own highest part. But what is highest in our knowledge is, not reason, but intellect, which is the origin of reason. God’s knowledge, then, is not ratiocinative but solely intellectual.

[9] Moreover, since God is absolutely perfect, as we proved above, every defect must be removed from Him. But ratiocinative knowledge arises from an imperfection in intellectual nature. For that which is known through another is less known than what is known through itself; nor is the nature of the knower sufficient for knowing that which is known through another without that through which it is made known. But in ratiocinative knowledge something is made known through another, whereas that which is known intellectually is known through itself, and the nature of the knower is able to know it without an external means. Hence, it is manifest that reason is a certain defective intellect. Therefore, the divine knowledge is not ratiocinative.

[10] Furthermore, those things whose species are in the knower are comprehended without discursive reasoning. For the sight does not proceed discursively to know the stone whose likeness it possesses. But the divine essence, as was shown above, is the likeness of all things. Hence, it does not proceed to know something through discursive reasoning.

[11] The solution of those difficulties that seem to introduce discursiveness into the divine knowledge is likewise at hand. First, because God knows other things through His essence. For it was shown that this does not take place discursively, since God’s essence is related to other things, not as a principle to conclusions, but as a species to things known. Secondly, because some might think it unbefitting if God were not able to syllogize. For God possesses the knowledge of syllogizing as one judging, and not as one proceeding by syllogizing.

[12] To this truth, which has been rationally proved, Sacred Scripture likewise gives witness. For it is written: “And things are naked and open to His sight” (Heb. 4:13). For what we know by reasoning is not through itself naked and revealed to us, but is opened and laid bare by reason.



Chapter 58

THAT GOD DOES NOT UNDERSTAND BY COMPOSING AND DIVIDING

[1] Through the same means we can also show that the divine intellect does not understand in the manner of a composing and dividing intellect.

[2] For the divine intellect knows all things by knowing its own essence. Now it does not know its own essence by composing and dividing, since it knows itself as it is and there is no composition in it. It does not, therefore, know in the manner of a composing and dividing intellect.

[3] Moreover, what is composed and divided by the intellect is of a nature to be considered separately by it. For there would be no need of composition and division if by apprehending the essence of a thing we grasped what belonged in it and what did not. If, then, God understood in the manner of a composing and dividing intellect, it would follow that He did not consider all things by one intuition but each thing separately. We have shown the contrary of this above.

[4] Furthermore, there can be no before and after in God. But composition and division come after the consideration of the essence, which is their principle. Hence, composition and division cannot be found in the operation of the divine intellect.

[5] Again, the proper object of the intellect is what a thing is. Hence, in relation to what a thing is the intellect suffers no deception except by accident, whereas as concerns composition and division it is deceived. So, too, a sense dealing with its proper sensibles is always true, but in other cases it is deceived. But in the divine intellect there is nothing accidental, but only that which is substantial. In the divine intellect, therefore, there is no composition and division, but only the simple apprehension of a thing.

[6] Furthermore, in the case of a proposition formed by a composing and dividing intellect, the composition itself exists in the intellect, not in the thing that is outside the soul. If the divine intellect should judge of things in the manner of a composing and dividing intellect, the intellect itself will be composite. This is impossible, as is clear from what has been said.

[7] Again, the composing and dividing intellect judges diverse things by diverse compositions, for the composition of the intellect does not exceed the terms of the composition. Hence, the intellect does not judge the triangle to be a figure by the same composition by which it judges man to be an animal. Now, composition or division is a certain operation of the intellect. If, then, God considers things by means of composing and dividing, it will follow that His understanding is not solely one but many. And thus His essence, as well, will not be solely one, since His intellectual operation is His essence, as was proved above.

[8] But it is not on this account necessary for us to say that God does not know enunciables. For His essence, being one and simple, is the exemplar of all manifold and composite things. And thus God knows through His essence all multitude and composition both of nature and of reason.

[9] With these conclusions the authority of Sacred Scripture is in harmony. For it is said in Isaiah (55:8): “For My thoughts are not your thoughts.” Yet it is said in a Psalm (93:11): “The Lord knows the thoughts of men,” which thoughts evidently proceed through composition and division in the intellect.

[10] Dionysius likewise says: “Therefore, in knowing itself, the divine wisdom knows all things-the material immaterially, the divisible indivisibly, and the many unitedly” [De div. nom. VII, 2].



Chapter 59

THAT THE TRUTH OF ENUNCIABLES IS NOT EXCLUDED FROM GOD

[1] From this it may be seen that, although the knowledge of the divine intellect is not of the sort belonging to an intellect that composes and divides, truth, which according to the Philosopher is found only in the composition and division of the intellect [Metaph. V, 4; De anima III, 6], is yet not excluded from it.

[2] For, since the truth of the intellect is “the adequation of intellect and thing,” inasmuch as the intellect says that what is is and what is not is not, truth belongs to that in the intellect which the intellect says, not to the operation by which it says it. For the intellect to be true it is not required that its act of understanding be adequated to the thing known, since the thing is sometimes material whereas the act of understanding is immaterial. Rather, what the intellect in understanding says and knows must be adequated to the thing, so that, namely, the thing be such as the intellect says it to be. Now, by His simple understanding, in which there is no composition and division, God knows not only the quiddities of things but also enunciations, as has been shown. Hence, that which the divine intellect says in understanding is composition and division. Therefore, truth is not excluded from the divine intellect by reason of its simplicity.

[1] When the incomplex is said or understood, the incomplex, of itself, is neither equated to a thing nor unequal to it. For equality and inequality are by relation, whereas the incomplex, of itself, does not imply any relation or application to a thing. Hence, of itself, it can be said to be neither true nor false; but the complex can, in which the relation of the incomplex to a thing is designated by a sign of composition or division. Nevertheless, the incomplex intellect in understanding what a thing is apprehends the quiddity of a thing in a certain relation to the thing, because it apprehends it as the quiddity of that thing. Hence although the incomplex itself, or even a definition, is not in itself true or false, nevertheless the intellect that apprehends what a thing is is always said to be through itself true, as appears in De anima III [6], although it can be by accident false, in so far as a definition includes some composition either of the parts of a definition with one another or of the whole definition with the thing defined. Hence, according as the definition is understood to be the definition of this or that thing, as it is received by the intellect, it will be called absolutely false if the parts of the definition do not belong together, as if we should say insensible animal; or it will be called false with reference to a given thing, as when the definition of a circle is taken as that of a triangle. Given, therefore, by an impossible supposition, that the divine intellect knew only incomplexes, it would still be true in knowing its own quiddity as its own.

[4] Again, the divine simplicity does not exclude perfection, because it possesses in its simple being whatever of perfection is found in other things through a certain aggregation of perfections or forms, as was shown above. But in apprehending incomplexes, our intellect does not yet reach its ultimate perfection, because it is still in potency to composition or division. So, too, among natural things, the simple are in potency with reference to the mixed, and the parts with reference to the whole. According to His simple understanding, therefore, God has that perfection of knowledge that our intellect has through both knowledges, that of complexes and that of incomplexes. But our intellect reaches truth in its perfect knowledge, that is to say, when it already has arrived at composition. Therefore, in the simple understanding of God as well there is truth.

[5] Again, since God is the good of every good, as having every goodness in Himself, as has been shown above, the goodness of the intellect cannot be lacking to Him. But the true is the good of the intellect, as appears from the Philosopher [Ethics VI, 2]. Therefore, truth is in God.

[6] And this is what is said in a Psalm: “But God is true” (Rom. 3:4).



Chapter 60

THAT GOD IS TRUTH

[1] From the foregoing it is evident that God Himself is truth.

[2] Truth is a certain perfection of understanding or of intellectual operation, as has been said. But the understanding of God is His substance. Furthermore, since this understanding is, as we have shown, the divine being, it is not perfected through any superadded perfection; it is perfect through itself, in the same manner as we have shown of the divine being. It remains, therefore, that the divine substance is truth itself.

[3] Again, according to the Philosopher, truth is a certain goodness of the intellect. But God is His own goodness, as we have shown above. Therefore, He is likewise His own truth.

[4] Furthermore, nothing can be said of God by participation, since He is His own being, which participates in nothing. But, as was shown above, there is truth in God. If, then, it is not said by participation, it must be said essentially. Therefore, God is His truth.

[5] Moreover, although, according to the Philosopher, the true is properly not in things but in the mind, a thing is at times said to be true when it reaches in a proper way the act of its own nature. Hence, Avicenna says in his Metaphysics that “the truth of a thing is the property of the being established in each thing” [VIII, 6]. This is so in so far as each thing is of a nature to give a true account of itself and in so far as it imitates the model of itself which is in the divine mind. But God is His essence. Therefore, whether we speak of the truth of the intellect or of the truth of a thing, God is His truth.

[6] This is confirmed by the authority of our Lord, Who says of Himself: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).



Chapter 61

THAT GOD IS THE PUREST TRUTH

[1] It is clear from this demonstration that in God there is pure truth, with which no falsity or deception can be mingled.

[2] For truth is not compatible with falsity, as neither is whiteness with blackness. But God is not only true, He is truth itself. Therefore, there can be no falsity in Him.

[3] Moreover, the intellect is not deceived in knowing what a thing is, just as the sense is not deceived in its proper sensible. But, as we have shown, all the knowledge of the divine intellect is in the manner of an intellect knowing what a thing is. It is impossible, therefore, that there be error or deception or falsity in the divine knowledge.

[4] Furthermore, the intellect does not err in the case of first principles; it errs at times in the case of conclusions at which it arrives by reasoning from first principles. But the divine intellect, as we have shown above, is not ratiocinative or discursive. Therefore, there cannot be falsity or deception in it.

[5] Again, the higher a knowing power, so much the more universal is its proper object, containing several objects under it. Thus, that which sight knows by accident the common sense or the imagination apprehends as contained under its proper object. But the power of the divine intellect is at the very peak of elevation in knowing. Hence, all knowable objects are related to it as knowable properly ,and essentially and not by accident. In such cases, however, the knowing power does not err. Therefore, the divine intellect cannot err in the case of any knowable object.

[6] Moreover, intellectual virtue is a certain perfection of the intellect in knowing. But according to intellectual virtue no intellect expresses what is false, but always what is true; for to speak the true is the good of the act of the intellect, and it belongs to virtue “to make an act good.” But the divine intellect, being at the peak of perfection, is more perfect through its nature than the human intellect is through the habit of virtue. It remains, therefore, that there cannot be falsity in the divine intellect.

[7] Furthermore, the knowledge of the human intellect is in a manner caused by things. Hence it is that knowable things are the measure of human knowledge; for something that is judged to be so by the intellect is true because it is so in reality, and not conversely. But the divine intellect through its knowledge is the cause of things. Hence, its knowledge is the measure of things, in the same way as an art is the measure of artifacts, each one of which is perfect in so far as it agrees with the art. The divine intellect, therefore, is related to things as things are related to the human intellect. But the falsity that is caused by the lack of equality between the human intellect and a thing is not in reality but in the intellect. If, therefore, there were no adequation whatever of the divine intellect to things, the falsity would be found in things and not in the divine intellect. Nevertheless, there is no falsity in things, because, so far as each thing has being, to that extent does it have truth. There is, therefore, no inequality between the divine intellect and things, nor can there be any falsity in the divine intellect.

[8] Again, as the true is the good of the intellect, so the false is its evil. For we naturally seek to know the truth and flee from being deceived by the false. But, as we have proved, there can be no evil in God. Hence, there can be no falsity in Him.

[9] Hence it is written: “But God is true” (Rom. 3:4); and in Numbers (23:19): “God is not a man, that He should lie”; and in John (I, 1:5): “God is light, and in Him there is no darkness.”



Chapter 62

THAT THE DIVINE TRUTH IS THE FIRST AND HIGHEST TRUTH

[1] From what we have shown it clearly results that the divine truth is the first and highest truth.

[2] As is clear from the Philosopher, things are disposed in truth as they are disposed in being. The reason for this is that the true and being follow one another; for the true then exists when that which is is said to be and that which is not is said not to be. But the divine being is first and most perfect. Therefore, its truth is the first and highest truth.

[3] Again, what belongs to a thing essentially belongs to it most perfectly. But, as we have shown, truth is said of God essentially. Therefore, His truth is the highest and first truth.

[4] Furthermore, there is truth in our intellect because it is adequated to the thing that the intellect understands. But, as can be seen in Metaphysics V [15], unity is the cause of equality. Since, then, in the divine intellect the intellect and that which it understands are absolutely one, its truth is the first and highest truth.

[5] Moreover, that which is the measure in any given genus is most perfect in that genus. That is why all colors are measured by white. But the divine truth is the measure of all truth. For the truth of our intellect is measured by the thing outside the soul, since our intellect is said to be true because it is in agreement with the thing that it knows. On the other hand, the truth of a thing is measured by the divine intellect, which is the cause of things, as will later on be proved. In the same way, the truth of artifacts comes from the art of the artisan, for a chest is then true when it agrees with its art. And since God is the first intellect and the first intelligible, the truth of any given intellect must be measured by the truth of His intellect—if, as the Philosopher teaches, each thing is measured by that which is first in its genus. The divine truth, therefore, is the first, highest, and most perfect truth.



Chapter 63

THE ARGUMENTS OF THOSE WHO WISH TO TAKE AWAY THE KNOWLEDGE OF SINGULARS FROM GOD

[1] Now, there are certain persons who are trying to take away the knowledge of singulars from the perfection of the divine knowledge. They use seven ways to confirm their position.

[2] The first way is based on the very condition of singularity. For the principle of singularity is designated matter, and hence it seems that singulars cannot be known by any immaterial power, given that all knowledge takes place through a certain assimilation. So, too, in our own case only those powers apprehend singulars that make use of material organs, for example, the imagination, the senses, and the like. But because it is immaterial, our intellect does not know singulars. Much less, therefore, does the divine intellect know singulars, being the most removed from matter. Thus, in no way does it seem that God can know singulars.

[3] The second way is based on the fact that singulars do not always exist. Therefore, either they will be known by God always, or they will be known at some time and not at another. The first alternative is impossible, since of that which does not exist there can be no knowledge; knowledge deals only with what is true, and what does not exist cannot be true. Nor is the second alternative possible, since, as we have shown, the knowledge of the divine intellect is absolutely unchangeable.

[4] The third way is based on the fact that not all singulars come to be of necessity but some happen contingently. Hence, there can be a certain knowledge of them only when they exist. Now, that knowledge is certain which cannot be deceived. But all knowledge of the contingent can be deceived when the contingent is future, since the opposite of what is held by knowledge can happen; for, if it could not happen, it would then be necessary. Hence it is that we cannot have any knowledge of future contingents, but only a certain conjectural estimation. Now, we must suppose that all God’s knowledge is, as we have shown, most certain and infallible. And because of His immutability, as we have said, it is impossible for God to begin to know something anew. From all this it seems to follow that God does not know contingent singulars.

[5] The fourth way is based on the fact that the will is the cause of some singulars. Before it exists, an effect can be known only in its cause, since, before it begins to be, this is the only way for an effect to exist. But the motions of the will can be known with certitude only by the one willing, in whose power they lie. It seems impossible, therefore, that God should have an eternal knowledge of such singulars as are caused by the will.

[6] The fifth way is based on the infinity of singulars. The infinite as such is unknown. Everything that is known is in a manner measured by the comprehension of the knower, since this “measure” is nothing other than a certain certification of the measured thing. That is why every art repudiates the infinite. But singulars are infinite, at least potentially. It seems impossible, then, that God knows singulars.

[7] The sixth way is based on the very lowliness of singulars. Since the dignity of a science is in a way determined from the dignity of its object, the lowliness of the knowable object likewise seems to redound to the lowliness of the science. But the divine intellect is most noble. Its nobility, therefore, forbids that it should know certain of the lowliest among singulars.

[8] The seventh way is based on the evil found in some singulars. For, since that which is known is found in the knower in a certain way, and there can be no evil in God, as was shown abovc, it seems to follow that God has absolutely no knowledge of evil and privation. This is known only by an intellect that is in potency, for privation can exist only in potency. From this it follows that God has no knowledge of the singulars in which there is evil and privation.



Chapter 64

THE ORDER OF WHAT IS TO BE SAID ON THE DIVINE KNOWLEDGE

[1] To remove this error, and likewise to show the perfection of the divine knowledge, we must diligently look into the truth of each of the above ways, so that what is opposed to the truth may be refuted. We shall first show, then, that the divine intellect knows singulars. Second, we shall show that it knows what does not exist in act. Third, that it knows future contingents with an infallible knowledge. Fourth, that it knows the motions of the will. Fifth, that it knows infinite things. Sixth, that it knows every lowly and least thing among beings. Seventh, that it knows evils and all privations and defects.



Chapter 65

THAT GOD KNOWS SINGULARS

[1] We shall therefore first show that the knowledge of singulars cannot be lacking to God.

[2] It was shown above that God knows other things in so far as He is their cause. Now, singular things are God's effects. God causes things in so far as He makes them to be in act. Universals, on the other hand, are not subsisting things, but rather have being only in singulars, as is proved in Metaphysics VII [13]. God, therefore, knows things other than Himself, not only universally, but also in the singular.

[3] Again, by knowing the principles of which the essence of a thing is composed, we necessarily know that thing itself. Thus, by knowing a rational soul and a certain sort of body, we know man. Now, the singular essence is composed of designated matter and individuated form. Thus, the essence of Socrates is composed of this body and this soul, just as the universal essence of man is composed of soul and body, as may be seen in Metaphysics VII [10]. Hence, just as the latter principles fall within the definition of universal man, so the former principles would fall in the definition of Socrates if he could be defined. Hence, whoever has a knowledge of matter and of what designates matter, and also of form individuated in matter, must have a knowledge of the singular. But the knowledge of Cod extends to matter and to individuating accidents and forms. For, since His understanding is His essence, He must understand all things that in any way are in His essence. Now, within His essence, as within the first source, there are virtually present all things that in any way have being, since He is the first and universal principle of being. Matter and accidents are not absent from among these things, since matter is a being in potency and an accident is a being in another. Therefore, the knowledge of singulars is not lacking to God.

[4] Moreover, the nature of a genus cannot be known perfectly unless its first differences and proper attributes are known. The nature of number would not be known perfectly if the even and the odd were not known. But universal and singular are differences or essential attributes of being. If, then, in knowing His essence God knows perfectly the common nature of being, He must know the universal and the singular perfectly. But, just as He would not know the universal perfectly if He knew the intention of universality and did not know the universal reality, for example, man or animal, so He would not know the singular perfectly if He knew the nature of singularity and did not know this or that singular. Therefore, God must know singular things.

[5] Furthermore, just as God is His being, so, as we have shown, He is His knowing. Now, since He is His being, all the perfections of being must be found in Him as in the first origin of being, as was shown above. Therefore, there must be found in His knowledge, as in the first source of knowledge, the perfection of all knowledge. But this would not be so if the knowledge of singulars were lacking to Him; for the perfection of some knowers consists in this knowledge. Therefore, it is impossible for God not to have a knowledge of singulars.

[6] Furthermore, among all ordered powers it is commonly found that the higher power, though one, extends to several things, whereas a lower power extends to fewer things and is nevertheless multiplied by its relation to them. This happens in the case of the imagination and the sense. The one power of the imagination extends to all the things that the five powers of the senses know, and to more besides. But the knowing power in God is higher than it is in man. Therefore, whatever man knows by means of diverse powers, namely, the intellect, the imagination, and the sense, this God considers by His one simple intellect. God, therefore, knows the singulars that we apprehend by the sense and the imagination.

[7] Moreover, the divine intellect does not gather its knowledge from things, as ours does; rather, as will be shown later on, it is through its knowledge the cause of things. The knowledge that the divine intellect has of other things is after the manner of practical knowledge. Now, practical knowledge is not perfect unless it reaches to singulars. For the end of practical knowledge is operation, which belongs to the domain of singulars. Therefore, the knowledge that God has of other things extends to singulars.

[8] Furthermore, as was shown above, the first movable is moved by a mover moving through intellect and appetite. Now, a mover could not cause motion through his intellect unless he moved the movable in so far as it is of a nature to be moved in place. But this is true of the movable in so far as it is here and now, and consequently in so far as it is singular. Therefore, the intellect that is the mover of the first movable knows the first movable in so far as it is singular. Now, this mover is either held to be God, in which case we have made our point, or it is held to be some being below God. But, if the intellect of such a being can by its power know the singular, which our intellect cannot, all the more will the intellect of God be able to do this.

[9] Again, the agent is more noble than the patient or thing acted upon, as act is more noble than potency. Hence, a form of a lower grade cannot by acting extend its likeness to a higher grade; rather, the higher form by acting can extend its likeness to a lower grade. Thus, from the incorruptible powers of the stars there are produced corruptible forms among sublunary things; but a corruptible power cannot produce an incorruptible form. Now, all knowledge takes place through the assimilation of the knower and the known. There is this difference, however, that the assimilation in human knowledge takes place through the action of sensible things on man’s knowing powers, whereas in the case of God’s knowledge the assimilation takes place contrariwise through the action of the forms of the divine intellect on the things known. Hence, since the form of the sensible thing is individuated through its materiality, it cannot extend the likeness of its singularity so that it be absolutely immaterial. It can extend its likeness to the level of the powers that use material organs; it reaches the intellect only through the power of the agent intellect in so far as it is completely divested of the conditions of matter. Thus, the likeness of the singularity of a sensible form cannot reach up to the human intellect. But the likeness of a form in the divine intellect, by reaching to the least of things to which its causality reaches, extends to the singularity of the sensible and material form. The divine intellect, therefore, can know singulars, but not the human intellect.

[10] Then, too, if God does not know singulars which even men know, there would follow the difficulty that the Philosopher raises against Empedocles, namely, that God is the most foolish of beings [De anima I, 5; Metaph. III, 4].

[11] This truth that we have proved is likewise strengthened by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For it is said in Hebrews (4:13): “Neither is there any creature invisible in His sight.” The contrary error likewise is removed by Sirach (16:16): “Do not say: I shall be hidden from God, and who shall remember me from on high?”

[12] It is also clear from what has been said how the objection to the contrary does not conclude properly. For, although that by which the divine intellect understands is immaterial, it is nevertheless the likeness of both form and matter, being the first productive principle of both.



Chapter 66

THAT GOD KNOWS THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT

[1] We must next show that the knowledge even of the things that are not is not lacking to God.

[2] As is clear from what we have said above, the relation of the divine knowledge to the things known is the same as the relation of the things that we know to our knowledge. Now, the relation of a thing known to our knowledge is this, namely, that the known thing can exist without our having a knowledge of it, as Aristotle illustrates of the squaring of a circle; but the converse is not true. The relation of the divine knowledge to other things, therefore, win be such that it can be even of non-existing things.

[3] Again, the knowledge of the divine intellect is to other things as the knowledge of an artisan to artifacts, since through His knowledge God is the cause of things. Now, the artisan knows through his art even those things that have not yet been fashioned, since the forms of his art flow from his knowledge to external matter for the constitution of the artifacts. Hence, nothing forbids that there be in the knowledge of an artisan forms that have not yet come out of it. Thus, nothing forbids God to have knowledge of the things that are not.

[4] Furthermore, through His essence God knows things other than Himself in so far as His essence is the likeness of the things that proceed from Him. This is clear from what we have said. But since, as was shown above, the essence of God is of an infinite perfection, whereas every other thing has a limited being and perfection, it is impossible that the universe of things other than God equal the perfection of the divine essence. Hence, its power of representation extends to many more things than to those that are. Therefore, if God knows completely the power and perfection of His essence, His knowledge extends not only to the things that are but also to the things that are not.

[5] Moreover, by that operation through which it knows what a thing is our intellect can know even those things that do not actually exist. It can comprehend the essence of a lion or a horse even though all such animals were to be destroyed. But the divine intellect knows, in the manner of one knowing what a thing is, not only definitions but also enunciables, as is clear from what we have said. Therefore, it can know even the things that are not.

[6] Furthermore, an effect can be pre-known in its cause even before it exists. Thus, an astronomer pre-knows a future eclipse from a consideration of the order of the heavenly motions. But God knows all things through a cause; for, by knowing Himself, Who is the cause of other things, He knows other things as His effects, as was shown above. Nothing, therefore, prevents God from knowing even the things that are not.

[7] Moreover, God’s understanding has no succession, as neither does His being. He is therefore an ever-abiding simultaneous whole-which belongs to the nature of eternity. On the other hand, the duration of time is stretched out through the succession of the before and after. Hence, the proportion of eternity to the total duration of time is as the proportion of the indivisible to something continuous; not, indeed, of that indivisible that is the terminus of a continuum, which is not present to every part of a continuum (the instant of time bears a likeness to such an indivisible), but of that indivisible which is outside a continuum and which nevertheless co-exists with any given part of a continuum or with a determinate point in the continuum. For, since time lies within motion, eternity, which is completely outside motion, in no way belongs to time. Furthermore, since the being of what is eternal does not pass away, eternity is present in its presentiality to any time or instant of time. We may see an example of sorts in the case of a circle. Let us consider a determined point on the circumference of a circle. Although it is indivisible, it does not co-exist simultaneously with any other point as to position, since it is the order of position that produces the continuity of the circumference. On the other hand, the center of the circle, which is no part of the circumference, is directly opposed to any given determinate point on the circumference. Hence, whatever is found in any part of time coexists with what is eternal as being present to it, although with respect to some other time it be past or future. Something can be present to what is eternal only by being present to the whole of it, since the eternal does not have the duration of succession. The divine intellect, therefore, sees in the whole of its eternity, as being present to it, whatever takes place through the whole course of time. And yet what takes place in a certain part of time was not always existent. It remains, therefore, that God has a knowledge of those things that according to the march of time do not yet exist.

[8] Through these arguments it appears that God has a knowledge of non-being. But not all non-beings have the same relation to His knowledge. For those things that are not, nor will be, nor ever were, are known by God as possible to His power. Hence, God does not know them as in some way existing in themselves, but as existing only in the divine power. These are said by some to be known by God according to a knowledge of simple understanding. The things that are present, past, or future to us God knows in His power, in their proper causes, and in themselves. The knowledge of such things is said to be a knowledge of vision. For of the things that for us are not yet God sees not only the being that they have in their causes but also the being that they have in themselves, in so far as His eternity is present in its indivisibility to all time.

[9] Nevertheless, whatever being a thing has God knows through His essence. For His essence can be represented by many things that are not, nor will be, nor ever were. His essence is likewise the likeness of the power of every cause, through which effects pre-exist in their causes. And the being that each thing has in itself comes from the divine essence as from its exemplary source.

[10] Thus, therefore, God knows non-beings in so far as in some way they have being, namely, in His power, or in their causes, or in themselves. This is not incompatible with the nature of knowledge.

[11] The authority of Sacred Scripture likewise offers witness to what has preceded. For it is said in Sirach (23:29): “For all things were known to the Lord God before they were created: so also after they were perfected He beholds all things.” And in Jeremias (1:5): “Before I formed you in the bowels of your mother I knew you.”

[12] It is also clear from what has preceded that we are not forced to say, as some said, that God knows singulars universally because He knows them only in universal causes, just as one would know a particular eclipse not in itself but as it arises from the position of the stars. For we have shown that the divine knowledge extends to singulars in so far as they are in themselves.



Chapter 67

THAT GOD KNOWS FUTURE CONTINGENT SINGULARS

[1] From this we can begin to understand somewhat that God had from eternity an infallible knowledge of contingent singulars, and yet they do not cease to be contingent.

[2] The contingent is opposed to the certitude of knowledge only so far as it is future, not so far as it is present. For when the contingent is future, it can not-be. Thus, the knowledge of one conjecturing that it will be can be mistaken: it will be mistaken if what he conjectures as future will not take place. But in so far as the contingent is present, in that time it cannot not-be. It can not-be in the future, but this affects the contingent not so far as it is present but so far as it is future. Thus, nothing is lost to the certitude of sense when someone sees a man running, even though this judgment is contingent. All knowledge, therefore, that bears on something contingent as present can be certain. But the vision of the divine intellect from all eternity is directed to each of the things that take place in the course of time, in so far as it is present, as shown above. It remains, therefore, that nothing prevents God from having from all eternity an infallible knowledge of contingents.

[3] Again, the contingent differs from the necessary according to the way each of them is found in its cause. The contingent is in its cause in such a way that it can both not-be and be from it; but the necessary can only be from its cause. But according to the way both of them are in themselves, they do not differ as to being, upon which the true is founded. For, according as it is in itself, the contingent cannot be and not-be, it can only be, even though in the future it can not-be. Now, the divine intellect from all eternity knows things not only according to the being that they have in their causes, but also according to the being that they have in themselves. Therefore, nothing prevents the divine intellect from having an eternal and infallible knowledge of contingents.

[4] Moreover, just as from a necessary cause an effect follows with certitude, so it follows from a complete contingent cause if it be not impeded. But since, as appears from what was said above, God knows all things, He knows not only the causes of contingent things but also those things by which these causes may be impeded. Therefore, He knows with certitude whether contingent things are or are not.

[5] Furthermore, an effect cannot exceed the perfection of its cause, though sometime it falls short of it. Hence, since our knowledge comes to us from things, it happens at times that we know what is necessary not according to the mode of necessity but according to that of probability. Now, just as in us things are the cause of knowledge, so the divine knowledge is the cause of the things known. Therefore, nothing prevents those things from being contingent in themselves of which God has a necessary knowledge.

[6] Again, an effect whose cause is contingent cannot be a necessary one; otherwise, the effect could be even though the cause were removed. Now, of the most remote effect there is both a proximate and a remote cause. If, then, the proximate cause were contingent, its effect would have to be contingent even though the remote cause is necessary. Thus, plants do not bear fruit of necessity, even though the motion of the sun is necessary, because the intermediate causes are contingent. But the knowledge of God, though it is the cause of the things known through it, is yet a remote cause. Therefore, the contingency of the things known is not in conflict with this necessity, since it may be that the intermediate causes are contingent.

[7] The knowledge of God, furthermore, would not be true and perfect if things did not happen in the way in which God knows them to happen. Now, since God knows all being, and is its source, He knows every effect not only in itself but also in its order to each of its causes. But the order of contingent things to their proximate causes is that they come forth from these causes in a contingent way. Hence, God knows that some things are taking place, and this contingently. Thus, therefore, the certitude and truth of the divine knowledge does not remove the contingency of things.

[8] From what has been said, it is therefore clear bow the objection impugning a knowledge of contingents in God is to be repulsed. For change in that which comes later does not induce change in that which has preceded; for it is possible that from prime necessary causes there proceed ultimate contingent effects. Now, the things that are known by God are not prior to His knowledge, as is the case with us, but, rather, subsequent to it. It does not therefore follow that, if something known by God can change, His knowledge of it can be deceived or in any way changed. We shall be deceived in the consequent therefore, if, because our knowledge of changeable things is itself changeable, we suppose on this account that such is necessarily the case in all knowledge.

[9] Again, when it is said that God knows or knew this future thing, a certain intermediate point between the divine knowledge and the thing known is assumed. This is the time when the above words are spoken, in relation to which time that which is known by God is said to be future. But this is not future with reference to the divine knowledge, which, abiding in the moment of eternity, is related to all things as present to them. If with respect to the divine knowledge we remove from its intermediate position the time when the words are spoken, we cannot say that this is known by God as non-existent, so as to leave room for the question whether it can not-be; rather, it will be said to be known by God in such a way that it is seen by Him already in its own existence. On this basis there is no room for the preceding question. For that which already is cannot, with respect to that moment of time, not be. We are therefore deceived by the fact that the time in which we are speaking is present to eternity, as is likewise past time (designated by the words God knew). Hence, the relation of past or present time to the future is attributed to eternity, to which such a relation does not belong. It is thus that we commit the fallacy of accident.

There is more. If each thing is known by God as seen by Him in the present, what is known by God will then have to be. Thus, it is necessary that Socrates be seated from the fact that he is seen seated. But this is not absolutely necessary or, as some say, with the necessity of the consequent; it is necessary conditionally, or with the necessity of the consequence. For this is a necessary conditional proposition: if he is seen sitting, he is sitting. Hence, although the conditional proposition may be changed to a categorical one, to read what is seen sitting must necessarily be sitting, it is clear that the proposition is true if understood of what is said, and compositely; but it is false if understood of what is meant, and dividedly. Thus, in these and all similar arguments used by those who oppose God’s knowledge of contingents, the fallacy of composition and division takes place.

[11] That God knows future contingents is also shown by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For it is said of the divine wisdom: “She knows signs and wonders before they be done, and the events of times and ages” (Wis. 8:8). And in Sirach (39:24-25) it is said: “There is nothing hidden from His eyes. He sees from eternity to eternity.” And in Isaiah (48:5): “I foretold you of old, before they came to pass I told you.”



Chapter 68

THAT GOD KNOWS THE MOTIONS OF THE WILL

[1] We must now show that God knows the thoughts of the mind and the motions of the will.

[2] As was shown above, whatever in any way exists is known by God in so far as He knows His own essence. There is a certain being in the soul and a certain being in things outside the soul. God, therefore, knows all these differences of being and what is contained under them. But the being that is in the soul is that which is in the will or in thought. It remains, therefore, that God knows that which is in thought and in the will.

[3] Moreover, in knowing His essence, God knows other things in the same way as an effect is known through a knowledge of the cause. By knowing His essence, therefore, God knows all things to which His causality extends. But it extends to the operations of the intellect and the will. For, since each thing acts through its form, from which the thing has a certain being, so the fount and source of all being, from which is also every form, must be the source of all operation; for the effects of second causes are grounded more principally in first causes. Therefore, God knows the thoughts and affections of the mind.

[4] Again, just as God’s being is prime and for this reason the cause of all being, so His understanding is prime and on this account the cause of all intellectual operation. Hence, just as God, by knowing His being knows the being of each thing, so by knowing His understanding and willing He knows every thought and will.

[5] Moreover, as is clear from what was said above, God knows things not only so far as they are in themselves, but also so far as they are in their causes; for He knows the order of a cause to its effect. But artifacts are in artisans through their intellect and will, just as natural things are in their causes through the powers of these causes. For just as natural things through their active powers assimilate their effects to themselves, so an artisan through his intellect induces into the artifact the form through which it is assimilated to his art. The situation is the same for all things that proceed intentionally from an agent. Therefore, od knows the thoughts and affections of the mind.

[6] Again, God knows intelligible substances no less than He knows or we know sensible substances; for intellectual substances are more knowable, since they are in act. Now, both God and we know how sensible substances are informed and inclined. Since, then, the soul’s thinking is a certain information of the soul itself and its affection is a certain inclination of the soul towards something (so, too, we likewise caH the inclination of a natural thing a natural appetite), it remains that God knows the thoughts and affections of the mind.

[7] This is confirmed by the testimony of Sacred Scripture. For it is said in a Psalm (7:10): “The searcher of hearts and reins is God.” And in the Proverbs (15:11): “Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more the hearts of the children of men?” And John (2:25): “He knew what was in man.”

[8] As for the dominion that the will has over its acts, through which it lies in the power of the will to will or not to will, this excludes the determination of the power to one effect and any violence from a cause acting from the outside; but it does not exclude the influence of a higher cause from which come its being and operation. Thus, the causality in the first cause, which is God, is not removed with respect to the motions of the will. Hence, God, by knowing Himself, can know such motions.



Chapter 69

THAT GOD KNOWS INFINITE THINGS

[1] After this we must show that God knows infinite things.

[2] By knowing Himself to be the cause of things God knows things other than Himself, as is clear from the above. But God is the cause of infinite things, if there are infinite things, since He is the cause of all things that are. Therefore, God knows infinite things.

[3] Again, as is clear from what we have said, God knows His own power perfectly. But a power cannot be known perfectly unless all that it can do is known, since this is how the magnitude of a power is in a manner gauged. But since, as was shown above, His power is infinite, it extends to infinite things. Therefore, God knows infinite things.

[4] Moreover, if the knowledge of God extends to all things that in any way are, as was shown, He must know not only that which is actual but also that which is potential. But among natural things there is the infinite in potency, though not in act, as the Philosopher proves in Physics III [6]. God, therefore, knows infinite things. So, too, unity, which is the source of number, would know the infinite species of number if it knew whatever was in it potentially; for unity is potentially every number.

[5] Furthermore, God knows other things by His essence as through a certain exemplary means. But, since His essence is of an infinite perfection, as was shown above, an infinite number of things having finite perfections can be derived from it. For no one thing or any number of things copied from the divine essence can equal the perfection of their cause. There thus always remains a new way in which some copy is able, to imitate the divine essence. Hence, nothing prevents God from knowing infinite things through His essence.

[6] Besides, God’s being is His understanding. Hence, just as His being is infinite, as we have shown, so His understanding is infinite. But as the finite is to the finite, so the infinite is to the infinite. If, then, we are able to grasp finite things according to our understanding, which is finite, so God according to His understanding can grasp infinite things.

[7] Moreover, the intellect that knows the greatest intelligible, all the more, rather than less, knows lesser intelligibles, as is clear from the Philosopher in De anima III [4]. This arises because the intellect is not corrupted by an excelling intelligible, as is the sense, but is rather perfected by it. Now, let us take infinite things, whether of the same species (for example, an infinite number of men) or of infinite species, and let us even assume that some or all of them were infinite in quantity, were this possible the universe of these things would be of a lesser infinity than is God. For each of them, and all of them together, would have a being that is received and limited to a given species or genus and would thus be finite in some respect. Hence, it would fall short of the infinity of God, Who is absolutely infinite, as was shown above. Therefore, since God knows Himself perfectly, nothing prevents Him from also knowing that sum of infinite things.

[8] Again, the more an intellect is more efficacious and penetrating in knowing, the more it can know many things through one means. So, too, every power is more united the more strong it is. But the divine intellect, as is clear from the above, is infinite in power or in perfection. Therefore, it can know infinite things through one means, namely, the divine essence.

[9] Moreover, the divine intellect, like the divine essence, is absolutely perfect. Hence, no intelligible perfection is lacking to it. But that to which our own intellect is in potency is its intelligible perfection. Now, our intellect is in potency to all intelligible species. But such species are infinite, since the species of both numbers and figures are infinite. It remains, then, that God knows all such infinites.

[10] Again, since our intellect can know infinite things in potency, being able to multiply the species of numbers infinitely, if the divine intellect did not know infinite things also in act, it would follow either that the human intellect knew more than did the divine intellect, or that the divine intellect did not know in act all the things that it knew in potency. Both alternatives are impossible, as appears from what was said above.

[11] Again, the infinite cannot be known in so far as it cannot be numbered, for it is in itself impossible to number the parts of the infinite, as implying a contradiction. But to know something by the numbering of its parts belongs to an intellect that knows one part after the other; it does not belong to an intellect that comprehends the diverse parts together. Therefore, since the divine intellect knows all things together without succession, it is no more prevented from knowing infinite things than from knowing finite things.

[12] Moreover, all quantity consists in a certain multiplication of parts, and this is why number is the first of quantities. Where, therefore, plurality does not bring about any difference, there neither does anything that follows quantity bring about any difference. Now, in the case of God’s knowledge, many things are known as one, since they are known not through diverse species but through one species, namely, the divine essence. Hence, many things are also known together by God, so that in this way plurality introduces no difference in the divine knowledge. Neither, therefore, does the infinite that accompanies quantity. Hence, to know infinite and finite objects makes no difference to the divine intellect. Thus, since God knows finite things, nothing prevents Him from also knowing infinite things.

[13] What is said in a Psalm (146:5) agrees with this: “And of His wisdom there is no number.”

[14] Now, from what has been said it is evident why our intellect does not know the infinite, as does the divine intellect. For our intellect is distinguished from the divine intellect on four points which bring about this difference. The first point is that our intellect is absolutely finite whereas the divine intellect is infinite. The second point is that our intellect knows diverse things through diverse species. This means that it does not extend to infinite things through one act of knowledge as does the divine intellect. The third point follows from the second. Since our intellect knows diverse things through diverse species it cannot know many things at one and the same time. Hence, it can know infinite things only successively by numbering them. This is not the case with the divine intellect which sees many things together as grasped through one species. The fourth point is that the divine intellect knows both the things that are and the things that are not, as has been shown.

[15] It is likewise evident how the statement of Aristotle, who says that the infinite as infinite is unknown, is not opposed to the present conclusion. For, since the nature of the infinite belongs to quantity, as he himself says, the infinite as infinite would be known if it were known through the measurement of its parts, for this is the proper knowledge of quantity. But God does not know in this way. God, therefore, so to speak, does not know the infinite in so far as it is infinite, but, as we have shown, in so far as it is related to His knowledge as though it were something finite.

[16] It must be observed, however, that God does not know infinite things with the knowledge of vision, to make use of an expression employed by others. For there neither are nor have been nor will be infinite things in act, since, according to the Catholic faith, generation is not infinite at either end. But God knows the infinite with the knowledge of simple understanding. For He knows the infinite things which neither are nor will be nor have been, which yet lie in the potency of the creation. God likewise knows the infinite things that are in His power, which neither are nor will be nor have been.

[17] Hence, as concerns the question of the knowledge of singulars, we may reply by denying the major. There are not infinite singulars. However, if there were, God would still know them.



Chapter 70

THAT GOD KNOWS LOWLY THINGS

[1] Having achieved this conclusion, we must show that God knows lowly things, and that this is not opposed to the nobility of His knowledge.

[2] The stronger a given active power is, the more does its action extend to more remote effects. This is also evident in the actions of sensible things. Now, the power of the divine intellect in knowing things is like an active power. For God knows things not by receiving anything from them, but, rather, by exercising His causality on them. Hence, since God is of an infinite power in understanding, as is clear from what has preceded, His knowledge must extend even to the most remote things. But the gradation of nobility and lowliness among all things is measured according to their nearness to and distance from God, Who is at the peak of nobility. Therefore, because of the perfect power of His intellect, God knows the lowliest possible among beings.

[3] Furthermore, everything that is, in that it is or in what it is, is in act and the likeness of the first act, and on this account has nobility. Whatever is in potency likewise participates in nobility from its order to act; for it is thus that it is said to be. It remains, then, that, considered in itself, each thing is noble, but is called lowly with respect to something more noble. Now, the most noble of creatures are no less distant from God than the lowest of creatures are distant from the highest. Hence, if this distance prevented God from knowing them, all the more would the previous distance. It would thus follow that God did not know anything other than Himself. This was disproved above. If, then, God knows something other than Himself, however supreme in nobility it may be, by the same reason He knows anything whatever, however exceedingly lowly it may be called.

[4] Moreover, the good of the order of the universe is more noble than any part of the universe, since the individual parts are ordered, as to an end, to the good of the order that is in the whole. Ibis is evident from the Philosopher in Metaphysics XI [10]. Hence, if God knows some other noble nature, He especially knows the order of the universe. But this order cannot be known without a knowledge both of the things that are more noble and of the things that are more lowly, in whose distances and relations the order of the universe consists. It remains, therefore, that God knows not only noble things but also the things that are deemed lowly.

[5] Again, the lowliness of the things known does not of itself redound to the knower. For it belongs to the nature of knowledge that the knower should contain the species of the thing known according to his own manner. Accidentally, however, the lowliness of the things known can redound to the knower. This may be either because, while he is considering lowly things, his mind is turned away from thinking of more noble things; or it may be because, as a result of considering lowly things, he is inclined towards certain unbefitting affections. This, however, is not possible in God, as is clear from what has been said. The knowledge of lowly things, therefore, does not detract from the divine nobility, but rather belongs to the divine perfection according as it pre-contains all things in itself, as was shown above.

[6] Furthermore, a power is not judged to be small because it can do small things but because it is limited to small things; for a power that can do great things can likewise do small ones. Hence, a knowledge that extends at the same time to both noble and lowly things is not to be judged as being lowly; rather, that knowledge is to be judged lowly which extends only to lowly things, as happens in our own case. For we examine divine and human things by different considerations, and the knowledge of the one is not the knowledge of the other, so that by comparison with the more noble knowledge the lower knowledge is deemed to be lowlier. But it is not thus in God. By one and the same knowledge and consideration He considers both Himself and all other things. No lowliness, therefore, is ascribed to His knowledge from the fact that He knows any lowly things whatever.

[7] What is said of the divine wisdom is in harmony with this conclusion. Wisdom “reaches everywhere by reason of her purity... and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her” (Wis. 7:24-25).

[8] Now, from what has been said it is evident that the argument advanced on the opposite side is not opposed to the truth we have shown. For the nobility of knowledge is measured in terms of those things to which knowledge is principally directed, and not in terms of all the things that fall within knowledge. For in the most noble among the knowledges that we have there are included not only the highest beings but also the lowest. For first philosophy extends its consideration from the first being to being in potency, which is the lowest being. Thus, under divine science are included the lowest of beings as being known along with its principal object. For the divine essence is the principal object known by God and in this object, as was shown above, all others are known.

[9] It is also evident that this truth is not opposed to what the Philosopher says in Metaphysics XI [9]. Aristotle there intends to show that the divine intellect does not know anything other than itself that is its perfection in the sense of being its principal known object. In this sense he says that it is better not to know lowly things than to know them. This is the case, namely, when the knowledge of the lowly is different from the knowledge of the noble and the consideration of lowly things impedes the consideration of noble things.



Chapter 71

THAT GOD KNOWS EVILS

[1] It now remains to show that God likewise knows evils.

[2] When a good is known, the opposite evil is known. But God knows all particular goods, to which evils are opposed. Therefore, God knows evils.

[3] Furthermore, the notions of contraries are themselves not contraries in the soul; otherwise, they would not be in the soul together nor would they be known together. The notion, therefore, by which evil is known is not opposed to the good but belongs, rather, to the notion of the good. Hence, if all the notions of goodness are found in God because of His absolute perfection, as was proved above, it follows that there is in Him the notion by which evil is known. And thus God also knows evils.

[4] Again, the true is the good of the intellect. For an intellect is said to be good because it knows the true. But it is true not only that the good is good but also that evil is evil; for just as it is true that that which is is, so it is true that that which is not is not. The good of the intellect, therefore, also consists in the knowledge of evil. But, since the divine intellect is perfect in goodness, no intellectual perfection can be lacking to it. Therefore, it has a knowledge of evils.

[5] Moreover, as was shown above, God knows the distinction of things. But negation is found within the notion of distinction; for those things are distinct of which one is not the other. Hence, the first notions, which are distinguished by themselves, mutually include a negation of one another. That is why the negative propositions among them are immediate: for example, no quantity is a substance. God, therefore, knows negation. But privation is a certain negation in a determinate subject, as is shown in Metaphysics IV [2]. God, therefore, knows privation. Consequently, He knows evil, which is nothing other than the privation of a due perfection.

[6] Furthermore, if God knows all the species of things, as was proved above, and is likewise conceded and proved by certain philosophers, He must know contraries. This is so because the species of certain genera are contraries and also because the differences of genera are contraries, as is proved in Metaphysics X [8]. But between contraries there is included the opposition of form and privation, as is said in the same reference. Therefore, God must know privation and consequently evil.

[7] Again, as was shown above, God knows not only form but also matter. But, since matter is a being in potency, it cannot be known perfectly unless those things to which its potency extends are known. This is the case with all other potencies. Now, the potency of matter extends both to form and to privation, since that which can be can also not-be. Therefore, God knows privation, and consequently He knows evil.

[8] Again, if God knows something other than Himself, He especially knows that which is the best. Ibis is the order of the universe to which, as to the end, all particular goods are ordered. But in the order of the universe certain things exist to ward off dangers that may come about from certain other things. This is clear from what is given to animals for their own protection. Therefore, God knows such dangers. Hence, He knows evils.

[9] Furthermore, in our own case the knowledge of evil is not considered blameworthy according to that which essentially belongs to knowledge, namely, the judgment that we have of evil things. But it is considered blameworthy by accident, in so far as through the consideration of evil one is sometimes inclined to evil things. This is not the case in God, because, as was shown above, He is immutable. Nothing, therefore, prevents God from knowing evils.

[10] What is said in Wisdom (7:30) harmonizes with this conclusion: “No evil can overcome” the “wisdom” of God. And in Proverbs (15:11) it is said: “Hell and destruction are before the Lord.” And in the Psalm (68:6): “My offenses are not hidden from you.” And in Job (11:11) it is said: “For He knows the vanity of men, and when He sees iniquity, does He not consider it?”

[11] We must observe, however, that on the knowledge of evil and privation the divine intellect and our own are differently disposed. For, since our intellect knows singular things through singular species that are proper and diverse, that which it is in act it knows through an intelligible species through which it is made an intellect in act. Hence, it can also know potency in so far as it is sometimes in potency to such a species; so that just as it knows act through act, so likewise it knows potency through potency. And because potency belongs to the nature of privation, since privation is a negation whose subject is a being in potency, it follows that it is suitable to our intellect in a certain manner to know privation in so far as it is of a nature to be in potency. Nevertheless, it can also be said that the knowledge of potency and privation follows from the knowledge of act.

[12] The divine intellect, on the other hand, which is in no way in potency, does not know privation or anything else in the above given way. For, if it knew something through a species that is not itself, it would necessarily follow that its proportion to that species would be as the proportion of potency to act. God must therefore understand solely through the species that is His own essence. It follows, consequently, that He understands only Himself as the first object of His intellect. But in understanding Himself He understands other things, as was proved above. And He knows not only acts, but also potencies and, privations.

[13] This is the meaning of the words that the Philosopher sets down in De anima III [6], when he says: “How does it apprehend evil or something black? For in a manner it knows contraries. But the knower must be potentially what it knows and this must be in it. But, if no contrary is present to a certain knower”—that is, in potency—“this knower knows itself and is in act and separable.”“ Nor must we adopt the interpretation of Averroes, who takes the position that it follows from this text that the intellect that is solely in act in no way knows privation. Rather, the sense is that it does not know privation by the fact of being in potency to something else; it knows privation because it knows itself and is always in act.

[14] Moreover, we must observe that, if God knew Himself in such a way that, by knowing Himself, He did not know other beings, which are particular goods, then in no way would He know privation and evil. For to the good that He is there is no contrary privation, since privation and its opposite bear on the same thing, and thus to that which is pure act no privation is opposed. And, consequently, neither is evil. Hence, granted that God knows only Himself, by knowing the good that He is He will not know evil. But because, in knowing Himself, He knows the beings that are by nature subject to privations, He must know the privations and the evils that are opposed to particular goods.

[15] We must likewise observe, as was shown above, that just as God in knowing Himself knows other things without any discursiveness of the intellect, so likewise it is not necessary that His knowledge be discursive if He knows the evil through the good. For the good is as the principle of the knowledge of what is evil. Hence, evils are known through goods as things are known through their definitions, not as conclusions are known through their principles.

[16] Nor, again, does it mean that there is imperfection in the divine knowledge if God knows evils through the privation of goods. For the position says that evil exists only in so far as it is the privation of good. Hence, in this way alone is it knowable, for each thing is knowable to the extent that it has being.



Chapter 72

THAT GOD HAS WILL

[1] Having dealt with what concerns the knowledge of the divine intellect, it remains for us to deal with God’s will.

[2] From the fact that God is endowed with intellect it follows that He is endowed with will. For, since the understood good is the proper object of the will, the understood good is, as such, willed. Now that which is understood is by reference to one who understands. Hence, he who grasps the good by his intellect is, as such, endowed with will. But God grasps the good by His intellect, For, since the activity of His intellect is perfect, as appears from what has been said, He understands being together with the qualification of the good. He is, therefore, endowed with will.

[3] Again, whoever possesses some form is related through that form to things in reality. For example, white wood is through its whiteness like some things and unlike other things. But in one understanding and sensing there is the form of the understood and sensed thing, since all knowledge is through some likeness. There must, therefore, be a relation of the one understanding and sensing to understood and sensed things according as these are in reality. But this is not because of the fact that these beings understand and sense, since thereby we rather find a relation of things to the one understanding and sensing; for to understand and to sense exist according as things are in the intellect and the sense, following the mode of each. He who senses and understands has a relation to the thing outside the soul through his will and appetite. Hence, all sensing and understanding beings have appetite and will. Properly speaking, however, the will is in the intellect. Since, then, God is intelligent, He must be endowed with will.

[4] Moreover, that which accompanies every being belongs to being inasmuch as it is in being. This accompaniment must be found in a supreme way in that which is the first being. Now, it belongs to every being to seek its perfection and the conservation of its being, and this in the case of each being according to its mode: for intellectual beings through will, for animals through sensible appetite, and to those lacking sense through natural appetite. To seek perfection belongs differently to those that have it and those that have it not. For those that have it not tend by desire, through the appetitive power proper to them, to acquire what is lacking to their desire, whereas those that have it rest in it. Hence, this cannot be lacking to the first being, which is God. Since, then, God is intelligent, there is in Him a will by which His being and His goodness are pleasing to Him.

[5] Again, the more perfect understanding is, the more delightful it is to the one understanding, But God understands and His understanding is most perfect, as was shown above. Therefore, His understanding is most full of delight. But intelligible delight is through the will, as sensible delight is through the appetite of concupiscence. There is, therefore, will in God.

[6] Furthermore, a form considered by the intellect does not move or cause anything except through the will, whose object is the end and the good, by which someone is moved to act. Hence, the speculative intellect does not move, nor does the imagination alone without an act of the estimative power. But the form of the divine intellect is the cause of motion and being in other things, since God produces things by His intellect, as will be shown later on. Therefore, God must be endowed with will.

[7] Again, among moving powers in beings possessing an intellect, the first is found to be the will. For the will sets every power to its act: we understand because we will, we imagine because we will, and so with the rest. The will has this role because its object is the end; although it is also a fact that the intellect, though not in the manner of an efficient and moving cause, but in that of a final cause, moves the will by proposing to it its object, namely, the end. It therefore belongs supremely to the first mover to have a will.

[8] Furthermore, “that is free which is for its own sake,” and thus the free has the nature of that which is through itself. Now, first and primarily, will has liberty in acting, for according as someone acts voluntarily he is said to perform any given action freely. To act through will, therefore, supremely befits the first agent, whom it supremely befits to act through himself.

[9] Moreover, the end and the agent to the end are always found to be of one order in reality; and hence the proximate end that is proportioned to an agent falls into the same species as the agent both among natural things and artificial things. For the form of the art through which the artisan works is the species of the form that is in matter, which is the end of the artisan; and the form by which the generating fire acts is of the same species as the form of the generated fire, which is the end of generation. But nothing is co-ordered with God, as within the same order, except Himself; otherwise, there would be several first beings—whose contrary was proved above. He is therefore the first agent because of the end that He is Himself. He is therefore not only the appetible end, but also the seeker of Himself as the end, so to speak. And this He is with an intellectual appetite, since He is intelligent. This is will. There is, therefore, will in God.

[10] The testimony of Sacred Scripture is witness to the divine will. For it is said in a Psalm (134:6): “Whatever the Lord pleased He has done.” And Romans (9:19): “Who resists His will?”



Chapter 73

THAT THE WILL OF GOD IS HIS ESSENCE

[1] From this it appears that God’s will is not other than His essence.

[2] It belongs to God to be endowed with will in so far as He is intelligent, as has been shown. But God has understanding by His essence, as was proved above. So, therefore, does He have will. God’s will, therefore, is His very essence.

[3] Again, as to understand is the perfection of the one understanding, so to will is the perfection of the one willing; for both are actions remaining in the agent and not going out (as does heat) to some receiving subject. But the understanding of God is His being, as was proved above. For, since the divine being is in itself most perfect, it admits of no superadded perfection, as was proved above. The divine willing also is, therefore, His being; and hence the will of God is His essence.

[4] Moreover, since every agent acts in so far as it is in act, God, Who is pure act, must act through His essence. Willing, however, is a certain operation of God. Therefore, God must be endowed with will through His essence. Therefore, His will is His essence.

[5] Furthermore, if will were something added to the divine substance, since the divine substance is something complete in being it would follow that will would be added to it as an accident to a subject, that the divine substance would be related to it as potency to act, and that there would be composition in God. All this was refuted above. Hence, it is not possible that the divine will be something added to the divine substance.



Chapter 74

THAT THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THE DIVINE WILL IS THE DIVINE ESSENCE

[1] From this it further appears that the principal object of the divine will is the divine essence.

[2] The understood good is the object of the will, as has been said. But that which is principally understood by God is the divine essence, as was proved above. The divine essence, therefore, is principally the object of the divine will.

[3] Again, the appetible is to appetite as the mover to the moved, as was said above. Similar, too, is the relation of the object of the will to the will, since the will belongs to the class of appetitive powers. If, then, the principal object of the divine will be other than the divine essence, it will follow that there is something higher than the divine will moving it. The contrary of this is apparent from what has been said.

[4] Moreover, the principal object willed is for each one willing the cause of his willing. For when we say, I will to walk in order to become healed, we are of the impression that we are assigning a cause. If, then, it be asked, why do you want to become healed? causes will be assigned one after the other until we arrive at the ultimate end. This is the principal object of the will, which is through itself the cause of willing. If, then, God should principally will something other than Himself, it will follow that something other is the cause of His willing. But His willing is His being, as has been shown.” Hence, something other will be the cause of His being—which is contrary to the nature of the first being.

[5] Furthermore, for each being endowed with a will the principal object willed is the ultimate end. For the end is willed through itself, and through it other things become objects of will. But the ultimate end is God Himself, since He is the highest good, as has been shown. Therefore, God is the principal object of His will.

[6] Moreover, every power is proportioned with equality to its principal object, for the power of a thing is measured according to its objects, as may be seen through the Philosopher in De caelo et mundo [11], But the will is proportioned with equality to its principal object, and similarly the intellect and likewise the sense. Now, nothing is proportioned with equality to the divine will save only God’s essence. Therefore, the principal object of the divine will is the divine essence.

[7] But since the divine essence is God’s understanding and all else that is said to be in Him, it is further manifest that in the same way He principally wills Himself to understand, to will, to be one, and other such attributes.



Chapter 75

THAT IN WILLING HIMSELF GOD ALSO WILLS OTHER THINGS

[1] Thereby it can be shown, however, that in willing Himself God also wills other things.

[2] For to whom it belongs to win the end principally, to him it belongs to will the things that are ordered to the end for the sake of the end. Now, God Himself is the ultimate end of things, as appears somewhat from what has been said. Hence, because He wills Himself to be, He likewise wills other things, which are ordered to Him as to the end.

[3] Again, everyone desires the perfection of that which is willed and loved by him for its own sake. For the things that we love for their own sake we want to be most perfect, and always to become better and be multiplied as much as possible. But God wills and loves His essence for its own sake. Now, the divine essence cannot be increased or multiplied in itself, as is manifest from what has been said; it can be multiplied solely according to its likeness, which is participated by many. God, therefore, wills the multitude of things in willing and loving His own essence and perfection.

[4] Moreover, whoever loves something in itself and for its own sake consequently loves all the things in which it is found: for example, he who loves sweetness for itself must love all sweet things. But God wills and loves His own being in itself and for its own sake, as shown above. Every other being, however, is by way of likeness a certain participation of His being, as appears somewhat from what has been said. It remains, then, that God, in that He wills and loves Himself, wills and loves other things.

[5] Furthermore, in willing Himself God wills all that is in Him. But all things in a certain manner pre-exist in Him through their proper models, as was shown above. God, therefore, in willing Himself likewise wills other things.

[6] Then, again, the more perfect the power of a being, by so much does its causality extend to more, and more remote, things, as was said above. But the causality of the end consists in this, that other things are desired for its sake. The more perfect an end, therefore, and the more willed, by so much does the will of one willing the end extend to more things for the sake of that end. But the divine essence is most perfect as goodness and as end. It will, therefore, supremely diffuse its causality to many, so that many things may be willed for its sake; and especially so by God, Who wills the divine essence perfectly according to its power.

[7] Moreover, will accompanies intellect. But by His intellect God principally understands Himself, and He understands other things in Himself. In the same way, therefore, He principally wills Himself, and wills all other things in willing Himself.

[8] This is confirmed by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For it is said in Wisdom (11:25): “For You love all things that are, and hate none of the things which You have made.”



Chapter 76

THAT GOD WILLS HIMSELF AND OTHER THINGS BY ONE ACT OF WILL

[1] From this result it follows that God wills Himself and other things by one act of will.

[2.] Every power is directed to its object and to the formal notion of the object by one operation or one act. For example, by the same sight we see light and color, which becomes visible in act through light. Now, when we will something solely for the sake of the end, that which is desired for the sake of the end derives the nature of something willed from the end; and thus the end is to it as the formal notion of the object is to the object, for example, as light is to color. Since, then, God wills other things for His own sake as for the sake of the end, as has been shown, He wills Himself and other things by one act of will.

[3] Moreover, what is perfectly known and desired is known and desired according to its whole power. But the power of the end is measured not only according as it is desired in itself, but also according as other things become desirable for its sake. Hence, whoever desires an end perfectly desires it in both ways. But there is no act of will in God by which He wills Himself and does not do so perfectly, since there is nothing imperfect in Him. Therefore, by whatever act God wills Himself, He wills Himself absolutely and other things for His sake. But He does not will things other than Himself except in so far as He wills Himself, as has been proved. It remains, then, that God does not will Himself and other things by different acts of will, but by one and the same act.

[4] Furthermore, as appears from what has been said, discursiveness is found in the act of a cognitive power according as we know principles by themselves and from them we arrive at conclusions. For, if we saw conclusions in principles by knowing the principles themselves, there would be no discursiveness, as likewise there is not when we see something in a mirror. But as principles are to conclusions in speculative matters, so ends are to the things ordered to them in operative and appetitive matters; for, just as conclusions are known through principles, so the appetite and doing of the things ordered to the end proceed from the end. If, then, someone wills separately the end and the things ordered to the end, there will be a certain discursiveness in His will. But this cannot be in God, since He is outside all motion. It remains, then, that God wills Himself and other things together and in the same act of will.

[5] Again, since God wills Himself always, if He wills Himself and other things by different acts it will follow that there are at once two acts of will in Him. This is impossible, since one simple power does not have at once two operations.

[6] Furthermore, in every act of the will the object willed is to the one willing as a mover to the moved. If, then, there be some action of the divine will, by which God wills things other than Himself, which is diverse from the action by which He wills Himself, there will be in Him some other mover of the divine will. This is impossible.

[7] Moreover, God’s willing is His being, as has been proved. But in God there is only one being. Therefore, there is in Him only one willing.

[8] Again, willing belongs to God according as He is intelligent. Therefore, just as by one act He understands Himself and other things, in so far as His essence is the exemplar of all things, so by one act He wills Himself and other things, in so far as His goodness is the likeness of all goodness.



Chapter 77

THAT THE MULTITUDE OF THE OBJECTS OF THE WILL IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE DIVINE SIMPLICITY

[1] From this it follows that the multitude of the objects of the will is not opposed to the unity and simplicity of the divine substance.

[2] For acts are distinguished according to their objects. If, then, the many objects that God wills caused a multitude in Him, it would follow that there was not in Him solely one operation of the will. This is against what has been proved above.

[3] Again, it has been shown that God wills other things in so far as He wills His own goodness. Hence, other things are to His will in the manner in which they are comprehended by His goodness. But all things in His goodness are one, since other things are in Him according to His way, namely, “the material immaterially and the many unitedly,” as appears from what has been said. It remains, then, that the multitude of the objects of the will does not multiply the divine substance.

[4] Moreover, the divine intellect and will are of an equal simplicity, for both are the divine substance, as has been proved. But the multitude of intellectual objects does not cause a multitude in the divine essence, nor a composition in the divine intellect. Neither, therefore, does a multitude of the objects of the will cause either a diversity in the divine essence or a composition in the divine will.

[5] Furthermore, there is this difference between knowledge and appetite, that knowledge takes place according as the known is in some way in the knower, whereas appetite does not take place in this way, but rather conversely, according as the appetite is related to the appetible thing, which the one pursuing seeks or in which be rests. And on this account good and evil, which have reference to appetite, are in things, whereas the true and the false, which have reference to knowledge, are in the mind, as the Philosopher says in Metaphysics VI [4]. Now, that something be related to many is not opposed to its simplicity, since unity itself is the principle of numerical multitude. Hence, the multitude of the objects willed by God is not opposed to His simplicity.



Chapter 78

THAT THE DIVINE WILL EXTENDS TO SINGULAR GOODS

[1] From this it is likewise apparent that, for the purpose of conserving the divine simplicity, we should not say that God wills other goods in a certain general way, in so far as He wills Himself to be the principle of the goods that can come forth from Him, but that He does not will them in the particular.

[2] For to will implies a relationship of the one willing to the thing willed. But the divine simplicity does not forbid -its being related even to many particulars; for God is said to be something best and first in relation to singulars. Therefore, His simplicity does not forbid Him from willing things other than Himself in the concrete or the particular.

[3] Again, the will of God is related to other things in so far as they participate in goodness in virtue of their order to the divine goodness, which is for God the reason of His willing. But not only the totality of goods, but even each one of them derives its goodness from the divine goodness, as well as its being. Therefore, the will of God extends to singular goods.

[4] Moreover, according to the Philosopher, in Metaphysics XI [10], a twofold good of order is found in the universe: one according to which the whole universe is ordered to what is outside the universe, as the army is ordered to its general; the other according as the parts of the universe are ordered to one another, as are the parts of the army. Now, the second order is for the sake of the first. But God, from the fact of willing Himself as the end, wills other things that are ordered to Him as to the end, as has been proved. He therefore wills the good of the order that the whole universe has to Him, as well as the good of the order that the universe has in the mutual relations of its parts. But the good of an order arises from singular goods. Therefore, God also wills singular goods.

[5] Furthermore, if God does not will the singular goods of which the universe is composed, it follows that in the universe the good that order is is by chance. For it is not possible that some part of the universe should bring together all the particular goods into the order of the universe; only the universal cause of the whole universe, God, Who acts through His will, as will later be shown, can do this. Now, that the order of the universe be by chance is impossible, since it would follow that the consequences of the order would all the more be by chance. It remains, then, that God wills even singulars among goods.

[6] Again, the understood good, as such, is what is willed. But God understands even particular goods, as was proved above. He therefore wills even particular goods.

[7] This is confirmed by the authority of Scripture, which, in the first chapter of Genesis (1:4, 31), shows the pleasure of the divine will with each single work, in the words: “God saw the light that it was good,” and similarly of His other works, and then of all the works together: “And God saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good.”



Chapter 79

THAT GOD WILLS EVEN THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT YET

[1] If willing implies a relationship of the one willing to the thing willed, it can possibly seem to someone that God cannot will save only the things that are. For relatives ought to be together, and when one is destroyed so is the other, as the Philosopher teaches. If, then, willing implies the relationship of the one willing to the thing willed, no one can will save the things that are.

[2] Furthermore, will is said in relation to the things that are willed, and similarly with cause and creator. But not even God can be called Creator, or Lord, or Father, save of the things that are. Therefore, neither can He be said to will save the things that are.

[3] From this it could be further concluded that, if the divine willing is unchangeable as is the divine being, and God does not will save the things that are in act, He wills nothing that does not always exist.

[4] To these difficulties some answer that the things that are not in themselves are in God and in His intellect. Hence, nothing prevents God from willing the things that do not exist in themselves in so far as they are in Him.

[5] But this does not seem to be a sufficient reply. For someone with a will is said to will something in so far as his will is related to the thing willed. If, then, the divine will is not related to the thing willed save only in so far as it exists in Him or in His intellect, it will follow that God does not will that thing except because He wills it to be in His being or in His intellect. But this is not the intention of those who bold the position; they intend that God wills such not-yet-existents to be even in themselves.

[6] Again, if the will is related to the thing willed through its object, the understood good, and the intellect understands not only that the good exists in it but that it exists in its own nature, the will likewise is related to the thing willed not only as it is in the knower, but likewise as it is in itself.

[7] Let us therefore reply that, since the apprehended good moves the will, the act of will itself must follow the condition of apprehension; just as the motions of the other movers follow the conditions of the mover that is the cause of motion. But the relation of the apprehension to the thing apprehended follows upon the apprehension itself, because one who apprehends is related to the apprehended thing in that he apprehends it. Now, he who apprehends does not apprehend a thing solely as it is in him, but as it is in its own nature; for not only do we know that a thing is understood by us because it is in the intellect, but we know also that it exists or has existed or will exist in its own nature. Therefore, although at that moment the thing does not exist save only in the intellect, the relation following upon the apprehension is to the thing, not as it exists in the knower, but as it is in its own nature, which the one apprehending apprehends.

[8] The relation of the divine will, therefore, is to the non-existing thing according as it exists in its proper nature at a certain time, and not only according as it is in God knowing it. The thing that does not now exist God wills to be at a certain time; He does not will solely the fact that He understands it.

[9] The relations of the one willing to the thing willed, of creator to created, and of maker to thing made, or of Lord to His subject creature, are not similar. For willing is an action remaining in the one willing, and hence does not require that something existing outside the will be understood. But to make, to create, and to govern signify an action terminating in an exterior effect, without whose existence such an action cannot be understood.



Chapter 80

THAT HIS OWN BEING AND HIS OWN GOODNESS GOD WILLS NECESSARILY

[1] From what was shown above it follows that God wills His own being and His own goodness in a necessary way, and cannot will the contrary.

[2] For it was shown above that God wills His own being and His own goodness as His principal object, which is for Him the reason for willing other things. In everything willed, therefore, God wills His own being and His own goodness, just as the sight in every color sees light. But it is impossible for God not to will something in act, for He would be willing only in potency, which is impossible, since His willing is His being. It is therefore necessary that God will His own being and His own goodness.

[3] Again, every being endowed with will necessarily wills his own ultimate end: for example, man necessarily wills his own beatitude and cannot will misery. But God wills Himself to be as the ultimate end, as appears from what has been said. Therefore, He necessarily wills Himself to be, nor can He will Himself not to be.

[4] Moreover, in appetitive and operative matters the end functions as an indemonstrable principle does in speculative matters. For just as in speculative matters the conclusions are reached from principles, so in active and appetitive matters the principle of all the things to be done and sought is taken from the end. But in speculative matters the intellect necessarily assents to the first and indemonstrable principles, and can in no way assent to their contraries. Therefore, the will necessarily inheres to the ultimate end, so as to be unable to will the contrary. Thus, if the divine will has no end other than itself, it necessarily wills itself to be.

[5] Again, all things in so far as they are, are likened to God Who is primarily and supremely being. But all things, in so far as they are, in their own way naturally love their own being. All the more, then, does God naturally love His own being. But His nature is a being necessary through itself, as was shown above. Therefore, God of necessity wills Himself to be.

[6] Furthermore, every perfection and goodness found in creatures is proper to God in an essential way, as was proved above. But to love God is the highest perfection of the rational creature, since thereby it is somehow united to God. Therefore, this love is found in God in an essential way. Therefore, of necessity God loves Himself. And thus He wills Himself to be.



Chapter 81

THAT GOD DOES NOT WILL OTHER THINGS IN A NECESSARY WAY

[1] But, if the divine will of necessity wills the divine goodness and the divine being, it might seem to someone that it wills of necessity other things as well, since God wills all other things in willing His own goodness, as was proved above. Nevertheless, if we consider the matter correctly, it appears that He does not will other things necessarily.

[2] For God wills other things as ordered to the end of His goodness. But the will is not directed to what is for the sake of the end if the end can be without it. For, on the basis of his intention to heal, a doctor does not necessarily have to give to a sick person the medicine without which the sick person can nevertheless be healed. Since, then, the divine goodness can be without other things, and, indeed, is in no way increased by other things, it is under no necessity to will other things from the fact of willing its own goodness.

[3] Furthermore, since the understood good is the object of the will, the will can will anything conceived by the intellect in which the nature of the good is present. Hence, although the being of any given thing is as such a good and its non-being an evil, the non-being of something can fall under the will (though not by necessity) because of some adjoined good that is preserved; since it is a good that something be, even though something else does not exist. Therefore, according to its own nature, the will cannot not will that good whose non-existence causes the nature of the good entirely to be lost. But there is no such good apart from God. According to its nature, therefore, the will can will the non-existence of anything whatever apart from God. But in God will is present according to its whole range, since all things in Him are universally perfect. God, therefore, can will the non-existence of anything whatever apart from Himself. Hence, it is not of necessity that things other than Himself exist.

[4] Moreover, God, in willing His own goodness, wills things other than Himself to be in so far as they participate in His goodness. But, since the divine goodness is infinite, it can be participated in infinite ways, and in ways other than it is participated in by the creatures that now exist. if, then, as a result of willing His own goodness, God necessarily willed the things that participate in it, it would follow that He would will the existence of an infinity of creatures participating in His goodness in an infinity of ways. This is patently false, because, if He willed them, they would be, since His will is the principle of being for things, as will be shown later on. Therefore, God does not necessarily will even the things that now exist.

[5] Again, the will of a wise man, by the fact of dealing with a cause, deals also with the effect that necessarily follows from the cause. For it would be foolish to wish the sun to be overhead and yet that it should not be daylight. But, as to an effect that does not follow of necessity from a cause, it is not necessary that someone will it because he wills the cause. Now, other things proceed from God Without necessity, as will be shown later on. It is not necessary, therefore, that God will other things from the fact of willing Himself.

[6] Moreover, things proceed from God as artifacts from an artisan, as will be shown later on. But, although the artisan wishes to have the art, he does not necessarily wish to produce the artifacts. Neither, therefore, does God necessarily will that there be things other than Himself.

[7] We must therefore consider why it is that God necessarily knows things other than Himself, but does not necessarily will them, even though from the fact that He understands and wills Himself He understands and wills other things. The reason is as follows. That he who understands should understand something arises from the fact that he is disposed in a certain way, since something is understood in act in so far as its likeness is in the one understanding. But that he who wills should will something arises from the fact that what is willed is disposed in a certain way. For we will something either because it is the end or because it is ordered to the end. Now, that all things be in God, so that they can be understood in Him, is necessarily required by the divine perfection; but the divine goodness does not necessarily require that other things exist, which are ordered to it as to the end. That is why it is necessary that God know other things, but not necessary that He will them. Hence, neither does God will all the things that can have an order to His goodness; but He knows all things that have any order whatever to His essence, by which He understands.



Chapter 82.

ARGUMENTS LEADING TO AWKWARD CONSEQUENCES IF GOD DOES NOT NECESSARILY WILL THINGS OTHER THAN HIMSELF

[1] Awkward consequences seem to follow if God does not will necessarily the things that He wills.

[2] For, if with respect to certain objects the will of God is not determined to them, it would seem to be disposed to opposites. But every power that is disposed to opposites is in a manner in potency, since “to opposites” is a species of the contingent possible. Therefore, there is potency in the will of God, which will consequently not be the substance of God, in which there is no potency, as was shown above.

[3] If being in potency, as such, is of a nature to be moved , because what can be can not-be, it follows that the divine will is changeable.

[4] Furthermore, if it is natural to God to will something about His effects, it is necessary. Now there can be nothing unnatural in God, since there cannot be anything accidental or violent in Him, as was proved above.

[5] Again, if what is open to opposites, being indifferently disposed, tends no more to one thing than to another unless it be determined by another, it is necessary either that God will none of the things towards which He is disposed to opposites, of which the contrary was proved above, or that God be determined to one effect by another. Thus, there will be something prior to Him, determining Him to one effect.

[6] But of these conclusions none necessarily follows. For to be open to opposites belongs to a certain power in a twofold way: in one way, from the side of itself; in another way, from the side of its object. From the side of itself, when it has not yet achieved its perfection, through which it is determined to one effect. This openness redounds to the imperfection of a power, and potentiality is shown to be in it; as appears in the case of an intellect in doubt, which has yet not acquired the principles from which to be determined to one alternative. From the side of its object, a certain power is found open to opposites when the perfect operation of the power depends on neither alternative, though both can be. An example is an art which can use diverse instruments to perform the same work equally well. This openness does not pertain to the imperfection of a power, but rather to its eminence, in so far as it dominates both alternatives, and thereby is determined to neither, being open to both. This is bow the divine will is disposed in relation to things other than itself. For its end depends on none of the other things, though it itself is most perfectly united to its end. Hence, it is not required that any potentiality be posited in the divine will.

[7] Mutability, similarly, is not required- For, if there is no potentiality in the divine will, God does not thus prefer one of the opposites among His effects as if He should be thought as being in potency to both, so that He first wills both in potency and afterward He wills in act; rather, He wills in act whatever He wills, not only in relation to Himself but also in relation to His effects. The reason rather is because the object willed does not have a necessary order to the divine goodness, which is the proper object of the divine will; just as we call enunciables, not necessary, but possible when there is not a necessary order of the predicate to the subject. Hence, when it is said, God wills this effect, it is manifest that it is not a necessary enunciable but a possible one, not in the sense in which something is said to be possible according to some power, but in the sense in which the possible is that whose existence is neither necessary nor impossible, as the Philosopher teaches in Metaphysics V [12]. For example, for a triangle to have two equal sides is a possible enunciable, but not according to some power, since in mathematics there is neither power nor motion. The exclusion of the aforesaid necessity, therefore, does not take away the immutability of the divine will. This Sacred Scripture professes: “But the triumpher in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance” (1 Samuel 15:29).

[8] However, although the divine will is not determined to its effects, we yet cannot say that it wills none of them, or that in order to will one of them it is determined by an exterior agent. For, since the apprehended good determines the will as its proper object, and the divine intellect is not outside God’s will, because both are His essence, if God’s will is determined to will something through the knowledge of His intellect, this determination of the divine will will not be due to something extraneous. For the divine intellect apprehends not only the divine being, which is God’s goodness, but also other goods, as was shown above. These goods it apprehends as certain likenesses of the divine goodness and essence, not as its principles. And thus, the divine will tends to them as befitting its goodness, not as necessary to it. The same thing happens in the case of our own will. When it is inclined to something as absolutely necessary to the end, it is moved to it with a certain necessity; but when it tends to something only because of a certain befittingness, it tends to it without necessity. Hence, neither does the divine will tend to its effects in a necessary way.

[9] Nor, furthermore, is it necessary because of the foregoing to posit something unnatural in God. For His will wills itself and other things by one and the same act. But its relation to itself is necessary and natural, whereas its relation to other things is according to a certain befittingness, not indeed necessary and natural, nor violent and unnatural, but voluntary; for the voluntary need be neither natural nor violent.



Chapter 83

THAT GOD WILLS SOMETHING OTHER THAN HIMSELF WITH THE NECESSITY OF SUPPOSITION

[1] From this we may infer that, although among His effects God wills nothing with absolute necessity, yet He does will something with the necessity of supposition.

[2] For it has been shown that the divine will is immutable. Now, if something is found in any immutable being, it cannot afterwards not be; for we say that a thing has moved if it is otherwise disposed now than it was previously. If, then, the divine will is immutable, assuming that it wills something, God must by supposition will this thing.

[3] Again, everything eternal is necessary. Now, that God should will some effect to be is eternal, for, like His being, so, too, His willing is measured by eternity, and is therefore necessary. But it is not necessary considered absolutely, because the will of God does not have a necessary relation to this willed object. Therefore, it is necessary by supposition.

[4] Furthermore, whatever God could He can, for His power is not decreased, as neither is His essence. But He cannot now not will what He is posited as having willed, because His will cannot be changed. Therefore, at no time could He not will what He has willed. It is therefore necessary by supposition that He willed whatever He willed, and also that He wills it; neither, however, is absolutely necessary, but, rather, possible in the aforementioned way.

[5] Moreover, whoever wills something, necessarily wills whatever it necessarily required for it, unless there be a defect in him either because of ignorance or because he is led astray through passion from the right choice of that which leads to the intended end. This cannot be said of God. If God, then, in willing Himself wills something other than Himself, it is necessary that He will for this object whatever is necessarily required by it. Thus, it is necessary that God will the rational soul to exist supposing that He wills man to exist.



Chapter 84

THAT THE WILL OF GOD IS NOT OF WHAT IS IN ITSELF IMPOSSIBLE

[1] From this it appears that the will of God cannot be of the things that are impossible in themselves.

For these have a contradiction in themselves, for example, that man is an ass, in which the rational and the irrational are included. For what is incompatible with something excludes some of the things that are necessary to it, as to be an ass excludes man’s reason. If, then, God necessarily wills the things that are required for what He wills by supposition, it is impossible for Him to will what is incompatible with these things. Thus, it is impossible for God to will the absolutely impossible.

[3] Again, as was shown above, in willing His own being, which is His own goodness, God wills all other things in so far as they bear His likeness. But in so far as a thing is opposed to the nature of being as such, there cannot be preserved in it the likeness of the first being, namely, the divine being, which is the source of being. Hence, God cannot will something that is opposed to the nature of being as such. But just as it is opposed to the nature of man as man to be irrational, so it is opposed to the nature of being as such that something be at once being and nonbeing. God, therefore, cannot will that affirmation and negation be true together. But this is included in everything that is of itself impossible, which has an opposition with itself as implying a contradiction. The will of God, therefore, cannot be of that which is of itself impossible.

[4] Moreover, the will is only of the understood good. Hence, whatever cannot be the object of the intellect is not an object of the will. But that which is of itself impossible is not an object of the intellect, since it is self-contradictory, except, of course, through the fault of one who does not understand what belongs to things—which cannot be said of God. Therefore, that which is of itself impossible cannot be the object of the will.

[5] Furthermore, as a thing is disposed toward being, so it is disposed toward goodness. But the impossible is that which cannot be. Therefore, it cannot be good, and hence cannot be willed by God, Who does not will save only the things that are or can be good.



Chapter 85

THAT THE DIVINE WILL DOES NOT REMOVE CONTINGENCY FROM THINGS, NOR DOES IT IMPOSE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY ON THEM

[1] From what has been said it results that the divine will does not remove contingency from things, nor does it impose absolute necessity on things.

[2] God wills whatever is required for a thing that He wills, as has been said. But it befits certain things, according to the mode of their nature, that they be contingent and not necessary. Therefore, God wills that some things be contingent. Now, the efficacy of the divine will requires not only that something be that God wills to be, but also that it be as He wills it to be. For, among natural agents as well, when the acting power is strong it assimilates its effect to itself not only as to species but also as to the accidents, which are certain modes of that thing. Therefore, the efficacy of the divine will does not remove contingency.

[3] Moreover, God wills the good of the universe of His effects more principally than He does any particular good, according as a fuller likeness of His goodness is found in it. But the completeness of the universe requires that there be some contingent things; otherwise, not all grades of beings would be contained in the universe. Therefore, God wills that there be some contingent things.

[4] Furthermore, the good of the universe is seen in a certain order, as appears in Metaphysics XI [10]. But the order of the universe requires that there be some changeable causes, since bodies are part of the perfection of the universe, and they do not move unless they be moved. Now, contingent effects follow from a changeable cause, for an effect cannot have a more stable being than its cause. Hence we see that, even though the remote cause is necessary, provided the proximate cause is contingent, the effect is contingent, as may be seen in the things that happen among sublunary bodies, which are contingent because of the contingency of the proximate causes even though the remote causes, which are the heavenly motions, are necessary. God, therefore, wills something to come to pass contingently.

[5] The necessity of supposition in the cause, moreover, does not require an absolute necessity in the effect. But God wills something in the creature, not by absolute necessity, but only by a necessity of supposition, as was shown above. From the divine will, therefore, an absolute necessity in created things cannot be inferred. But only this excludes contingency, for even the contingents open to opposites are made necessary by supposition: for example, that Socrates be moved, if he runs, is necessary. Therefore, the divine will does not exclude contingency from the things it wills.

[6] Hence, it does not follow, if God wills something, that it will of necessity take place. But this conditional is true and necessary: If God wills something, it will be. But the consequent does not have to be necessary.



Chapter 86

THAT A REASON CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THE DIVINE WILL

[1] From what has been said we can infer that a reason can be assigned to the divine will.

[2] The end is the reason for willing the things that are for the sake of the end. But God wills His own goodness as the end, and other things He wills as things that are for the sake of the end. His goodness, therefore, is the reason why He wills the other things which are different from Himself.

[3] Again, a particular good is ordered to the good of the whole as to its end, as the imperfect to the perfect. Now, some things fall under the divine will according to their disposition in the order of the good. It remains, then, that the good of the universe is the reason why God wills each particular good in the universe.

[4] Again, as was shown above, on the supposition that God wills something, it follows necessarily that He wills the things required for it. But that which imposes necessity on another is the reason why that other exists. Therefore, the reason why God wills the things that are required for each thing is that that thing be for which they are required.

[5] Thus, therefore, can we proceed in assigning the reason of the divine will. God wills man to have a reason in order that man be; He wills man to be so that the universe may be complete; and He wills that the good of the universe be because it befits His goodness.

[6] However, this threefold reason does not proceed according to the same relationship. For the divine goodness neither depends on the perfection of the universe nor is anything added to it from this perfection. For, although the perfection of the universe necessarily depends on certain particular goods that are its essential parts, yet on some of them it does not depend of necessity, but nevertheless a certain goodness or adornment accrues to the universe from them, as from those things that exist only for the support or adornment of the other parts of the universe. A particular good depends necessarily on the things that are absolutely required for it, even though this too has certain things that are for its embellishment. Hence, at times the reason of the divine will contains only a befittingness; at other times, usefulness; at still other times, a necessity of supposition; but a necessity that is absolute only when it wills itself.



Chapter 87

THAT NOTHING CAN BE THE CAUSE OF THE DIVINE WILL

[1] Now, although a certain reason of the divine will can be assigned, it does not follow that anything is the cause of the divine will.

[2] For to the will the cause of its willing is the end. But the end of the divine will is its goodness. Hence, it is the cause of God’s willing, just as it is also His act of will.

[3] As to the other objects willed by God, none is the cause of willing for God. But one of them is the cause for the other to have an order to the divine goodness. And thus God is understood to will one of them for the sake of another.

[4] It is nevertheless manifest that no discursiveness is to be posited in the divine will. For where there is one act that is no discursiveness, as was shown above in connection with the intellect. But by means of one act God wills His goodness and all other things, since His action is His essence.

[5] Through the foregoing is set aside the error of certain persons who said that all things proceed from God according to His simple will, which means that we are not to give an explanation of anything except that God wills it.

[6] This view is likewise opposed to Sacred Scripture, which proclaims that God made all things according to the order of His wisdom, as is said in the Psalm (103:24): “You made all things in wisdom.” And in Sirach (1:10) it is said that God “poured” His wisdom “out upon all His works.”



Chapter 88

THAT IN GOD THERE IS FREE CHOICE

[1] From what has been said it can be shown that free choice is found in God.

[2] Free choice is said in relation to the things that one wills, not of necessity, but of his own accord. Thus, there is in us free choice in relation to our willing to run or to walk. But God wills things other than Himself without necessity, as was shown above. Therefore, to have free choice befits God.

[3] Again, towards the things to which it is not determined by nature the divine will is in a manner inclined through its intellect, as was shown above. But on this account is man said to have free choice as opposed to the other animals because he is inclined to willing by the judgment of the reason and not by the impulse of nature, as are the brutes. Therefore, in God there is free choice.

[4] Furthermore, according to the Philosopher in Ethics III [5], “will is of the end, but election is of that which is for the sake of the end.” Since, then, God wills Himself as the end, and other things as what is for the sake of the end, it follows that with reference to Himself God has only will, but with reference to other things He has election. But election is made by choice. Therefore, free choice befits God.

[5] Moreover, because he has free choice, man is said to be master of his acts. But this supremely befits the first agent, whose act does not depend on another. Therefore, God has free choice.

[6] This can likewise be gathered from the very meaning of the name. For “that is free which is for its own sake,” according to the Philosopher in the beginning of the Metaphysics [I, 2]. But this befits no being more than the first cause, God.



Chapter 89

THAT IN GOD THERE ARE NOT THE PASSIONS OF THE APPETITES

[1] From what has preceded we can know that the passions of the appetites are not in God.

[2] Now, according to intellective appetite there is no passion, but only according to sensitive appetite, as is proved in Physics VII [3]. But no such appetite can be in God, since He does not have sensitive knowledge, as is manifest from what has been said above. Therefore, there is no passion of the appetite in God.

[3] Moreover, every passion of the appetite takes place through some bodily change, for example, the contraction or distension of the heart, or something of the sort. Now, none of this can take place in God, since He is not a body or a power in a body, as was shown above. There is, therefore, no passion of the appetite in Him.

[4] Again, in every passion of the appetite the patient is somehow drawn out of his usual, calm, or connatural disposition. A sign of this is that such passions, if intensified, bring death to animals. But it is not possible for God to be somehow drawn outside His natural condition, since He is absolutely immutable, as has been shown. It appears, then, that such passions cannot be found in God.

[5] Moreover, every affection arising from a passion is directed determinately to one thing according to the manner and measure of the passion. For passion has an impulse to something one, as does nature, and on this account it must be curbed and regulated by reason. But the divine will is not determined in itself to something one among creatures, except out of the order of its wisdom, as was shown above. Therefore, there is no passion of the appetite in God.

[6] Furthermore, every passion belongs to something existing in potency. But God is completely free from potency, since He is pure act. God, therefore, is solely agent, and in no way does any passion have a place in Him.

[7] Thus, therefore, by reason of its genus, passion is excluded in God.

[8] Some passions, however, are excluded from God not only by reason of their genus, but also by reason of their species. For every passion is specified by its object. That passion, therefore, whose subject is absolutely unbefitting to God is removed from God even according to the nature of its proper species.

[9] Such a passion, however, is sorrow or pain, for its subject is the already present evil, just as the object of joy is the good present and possessed. Sorrow and pain, therefore, of their very nature cannot be found in God.

[10] Furthermore, the notion of the object of a given passion is derived not only from good and evil, but also from the fact that one is disposed in a certain way towards one of them. For it is thus that hope and joy differ. If, then, the mode itself in which one is disposed toward the object that is included in the notion of passion is not befitting to God, neither can the passion itself befit Him, even through the nature of its proper species. Now, although hope has as its object something good, yet it is not a good already possessed, but one to be possessed. This cannot befit God, because of His perfection, which is so great that nothing can be added to it. Hope, therefore, cannot be found in God, even by reason of its species. And likewise, neither can the. desire of something not possessed.

[11] Moreover, just as the divine perfection excludes from God the potency of the addition of some good to be obtained, so likewise, and all the more, does it exclude the potency to evil. Fear has reference to the evil that can threaten, as hope has reference to a good to be obtained. By a twofold reason of its species, therefore, is fear excluded from God: both because it belongs only to one existing in potency and because it has for its object a threatening evil.

[12] Again, repentance implies a change of affection. Therefore, the nature of repentance likewise is repugnant to God, not only because it is a species of sadness, but also because it implies a change of will.

[13] Furthermore, without an error of the cognitive power it is impossible that what is good be apprehended as evil. Nor is it possible that the evil of one be the good of another, except among particular goods in which “the corruption of one is the generation of another.” But the universal good does not lose anything because of the existence of some particular good, but is rather mirrored by each one. God, however, is the universal good, and by participating in His likeness all things are called good. The evil of no thing, therefore, can be His good. Nor is it possible that what is absolutely good, and is not evil to itself, He should apprehend as something evil; for His knowledge is without error, as has been shown. Envy, therefore, cannot be found in God, even according to the nature of its species, not only because it is a species of sadness, but also because it is saddened by the good of another and thus takes his good as its own evil.

[14] Moreover, to be saddened over a good and to seek evil are of the same nature, for the first arises because the good is judged to be evil, while the second arises because evil is judged to be good. Anger is the appetite of another’s evil for the sake of revenge. Anger, therefore, is far from God according to the nature of its species, not only because it is an effect of sadness, but likewise because it is an appetite for revenge arising from sadness due to an injury received.

[15] Again, whatever other passions are species of these or are caused by them, are for the same reason removed from God.



Chapter 90

THAT IN GOD THERE ARE DELIGHT AND JOY, BUT THEY ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE DIVINE PERFECTION

[1] There are certain passions which, though they do not befit God as passions, do not signify anything by the nature of their species that is repugnant to the divine perfection.

[2] Among these passions are joy and delight. Delight is of a present good. Neither, therefore, by reason of its object, which is a good, nor by reason of its disposition towards its object, which is possessed in act, is joy, according to the nature of its species, repugnant to the divine perfection.

[3] From this it is manifest that joy or delight is properly in God. For just as the apprehended good and evil are the object of sensible appetite, so, too, are they of intellective appetite. It belongs to both to seek good and avoid evil, whether truly or by estimation. There is the difference that the object of intellective appetite is more common than that of the sensitive appetite, because intellective appetite has reference to good and evil absolutely, whereas sensitive appetite has reference to good or evil according to the sense. So, too, the object of the intellect is more common than that of the sense. But the operations of appetite derive their species from their objects. Hence, there are found in intellective appetite, which is the will, operations that in the nature of their species are similar to the operations of the sensitive appetite, differing in that in the sensitive appetite there are passions because of its union to a bodily organ, whereas in the intellective appetite there are simple operations; for just as through the passion of fear, which resides in the sensitive appetite, someone flees a future evil, so without passion the intellective appetite does the same thing. Since, then, joy and delight are not repugnant to God according to their species, but only in so far as they are passions, and since they are found in the will according to their species but not as passions, it remains that they are not lacking even to the divine will.

[4] Again, joy and delight are a certain resting of the will in its object. But God, Who is His own principal object willed, is supremely at rest in Himself, as containing all abundance in Himself. God, therefore, through His will supremely rejoices in Himself.

[5] Furthermore, delight is a certain perfection of operation, as appears from the Philosopher in Ethics X [4]; “for it perfects operation, as does beauty youth.” But God has the most perfect operation in understanding, as appears from what has been said. If, then, our understanding is delightful because of its perfection, the divine understanding will be most full of delight.

[6] Moreover, each thing takes joy in its like as in something agreeable, except by accident in so far as it may interfere with one’s own advantage: for example, “potters quarrel among themselves” because one interferes with the profit of the other. Now, every good is a likeness of the divine good, as was said above, nor does God lose any good because of some good. It remains, then, that God takes joy in every good.

[7] joy and delight, then, are properly in God. Now, joy and delight differ in notion. For delight arises from a really conjoined good, whereas joy does not require this, but the resting of the will in the object willed suffices for the nature of joy. Hence, delight is only of the conjoined good if it be taken properly, whereas joy is of a non-conjoined good. From this it is apparent that God properly delights in Himself, but He takes joy both in Himself and in other things.



Chapter 91

THAT IN GOD THERE IS LOVE

[1] In the same way, there must be love in God according to the act of His will.

[2] For this belongs properly to the nature of love, that the lover will the good of the one he loves. Now, God wills His own good and that of others, as appears from what has been said. This means, therefore, that God loves Himself and other things.

[3] Again, for true love it is required that we will someone’s good as his good. For if we will someone’s good only in so far as it leads to the good of another, we love this someone by accident, just as he who wishes to store wine in order to drink it or loves a man so that this man may be useful or enjoyable to him, loves the wine or the man by accident, but essentially he loves himself. But God wills the good of each thing according as it is the good of each thing; for He wills each thing to be according as it is in itself good (although He likewise orders one thing to another’s use). God, then, truly loves Himself and other things.

[4] Moreover, since each thing in its own way wills and seeks its proper good, if it is the nature of love that the lover will and seek the good of the one he loves, it follows that the lover is to the loved as to that which in some way is one with him. From this the proper nature of love is seen to consist in this, that the affection of the one tends to the other as to someone who is somehow one with him. On this account it is said by Dionysius that love is a “unitive power” [De div. nom. IV, 13]. Therefore, the more that through which the lover is one with the one he loves is greater, the more is the love intense. For we love those whom the origin of birth joins to us, or the way of life, or something of the sort, more than those whom the community of human nature alone joins to us. Again, the more the source of the union is intimate to the lover, by so much the stronger becomes the love. Hence, at times, the love arising from some passion becomes more intense than the love that is of natural origin or from some habit; but it passes more easily. But the source whence all things are joined to God, namely, His goodness, which all things imitate, is what is supreme and most intimate in God, since it is His goodness. There is, therefore, in God not only a true love, but also a most perfect and a most enduring love.

[5] Again, from the side of its object love does not signify anything repugnant to God, since its object is the good; neither does it from the mode of its disposition towards its object. For we love some thing, not less, but more when we have it, because a good is closer to us when we have it. So, too, a motion to an end among natural things becomes intensified from the nearness of the end. (The contrary sometimes happens by accident, namely, when in the one we love we experience something repugnant to love; then the object loved is loved less when it is gained.) Hence, love is not repugnant to the divine perfection according to the nature of its species. Therefore, it is found in God.

[6] Moreover, it belongs to love to move towards union, as Dionysius says. For since, because of a likeness or congeniality between the lover and the one he loves, the affection of the lover is in a manner united to the one loved, his appetite tends to the perfection of the union, so that, namely, the union that has already begun in affection may be completed in act. Hence, it is also the privilege of friends to take joy in one another’s presence, in living together, and in conversation. But God moves all things to union, for in so far as He gives them being and other perfections, He joins them to Himself in the manner in which this is possible. God, therefore, loves Himself and other things.

[7] Again, the principle of every affection is love. For joy and desire are only of a good that is loved, and fear and sadness are only of an evil that is opposed to the good that is loved; and from these all the other affections take their origin. But in God there is joy and delight, as was shown above. Therefore, in God there is love.

[8] Now, it might seem to someone that God does not love this thing more than that. For, if increase or decrease in intensity properly belongs to a changeable nature, it cannot befit God, from whom all mutability is absent.

[9] Again, none of the other things that are said of God in terms of operation are said of Him according to more and less; for neither does He know one thing more than another, nor does He take more joy over this thing than over that.

[10] We must therefore observe that, although the other operations of the soul deal with only one object, love alone seems to be directed to two objects. For by the fact that we understand and rejoice, we must be somehow related to some object. Love, however, wills something for someone, for we are said to love the thing to which we wish some good, as explained above. Hence, the things that we want, absolutely and properly we are said to desire, but not to love; rather, we love ourselves for whom we want those things: whence it is by accident and improperly that such things are said to be loved. Now, then, the other operations are susceptible of more and less only according to the vigor of the action. This cannot take place in God. For the vigor of an action is measured according to the power by which it is done, and every divine action belongs to one and the same power. On the other hand, love is said according to more and less in a twofold way. In one way, from the good that we will to someone, and according to this we are said to love him more to whom we will the greater good. In a second way, from the vigor of the action, and in this way we are said to love him more to whom we will with greater fervor and efficacity, though not a greater good, yet an equal good.

[11] In the first way, nothing prevents us from saying that God loves one thing more than another, according as He wills it a greater good. In the second way, this cannot be said, for the same reason that was given in the case of the other operations.

[12] It is therefore apparent from what has been said that, from among our affections, there is none that can properly exist in God save only joy and love; although even these are not in God as passions, as they are in us.

[13] That there are joy and delight in God is confirmed by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For it is said in a Psalm (15:11): “At Your right hand there are delights even to the ends.” In the Proverbs (8:30), divine Wisdom, which is God, as we have shown, says: “I... was delighted every day playing before Him at all times.” And Luke (15:10): “There is joy in heaven before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance.” The Philosopher likewise says in Ethics VII [14] that “God ever rejoices with one simple delight.”

[14] Sacred Scripture likewise records the love of God: “He hath loved the people” (Deut. 33:3); “I have loved you with an everlasting love” (Jer. 31:3); “For the Father Himself loves you” (John 16:27). Certain philosophers likewise made God’s love to be the principle of things. With this view the words of Dionysius agree when he says that “the divine love did not allow Him to be without offspring” [De div. nom. IV, 11].

[15] It must be noted, however, that the other affections, which in their species are repugnant to the divine perfection, are also said of God in Sacred Scripture, not indeed properly, as has been proved, but metaphorically, because of a likeness either in effects or in some preceding affection.

[16] I say of effects because the will at times, following the order of wisdom, tends to that effect to which someone is inclined because of a defective passion; for a judge punishes from justice, as the angry man punishes from anger. Hence, God is at times called angry in so far as, following the order of His wisdom, He wills to punish someone, according to a Psalm (2:13): “When His wrath shall be kindled in a short time.” On the other hand, God is called merciful in so far as out of His loving-kindness He takes away the miseries of men, just as we do the same thing through the passion of mercy. Hence the Psalm (102:8): “The Lord is compassionate and merciful: longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.” Sometimes, too, God is said to repent in so far as according to the eternal and immutable order of His providence He makes what He previously had destroyed, or destroys what He had previously had made—as those who are moved by repentance are found doing. Hence Genesis (6:7): “I repent that I have made man.” That this cannot be taken at the letter appears from what is said in 1 Samuel (15:29): “But the triumpher in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance.”

[17] And I say in some preceding affection since love and joy, which are properly in God, are the principles of the other affections, love in the manner of a moving principle and joy in the manner of an end. Hence, those likewise who punish in anger rejoice as having gained their end. God, then, is said to be saddened in so far as certain things take place that are contrary to what He loves and approves; just as we experience sadness over things that have taken place against our will. This is apparent in Isaiah ( 59:15-16): God “saw, and it appeared evil in His eyes, because there is no judgment. And He saw that there is not a man, and He stood astonished, because there is none to oppose Himself.”

[18] Now, what we have said sets aside the error of certain Jews who attributed anger, sadness, repentance, and all such passions in their proper sense to God, failing to distinguish what in Sacred Scripture is said properly and what metaphorically.



Chapter 92

HOW VIRTUES MAY BE HELD TO BE IN GOD

[1] Following what has been said, it remains to show how virtues may be posited in God. For just as God’s being is universally perfect, containing in itself the perfections of all beings, so His goodness must in a manner contain the goodness in each and every thing. Now, virtue is a certain goodness in the virtuous, for “according to it is one called good, and his work good.” Therefore, the divine goodness must contain in its way all the virtues.

[2] As a consequence, none of them is posited as a habit in God, as happens in our case. For it does not befit God to be good through something else superadded to Him, but through His essence, since He is absolutely simple. Nor, likewise, does He act through something added to His essence, since His action is His being, as has been shown. Hence, His virtue is not some habit, but His essence.

[3] Again, a habit is an imperfect act, as being intermediate between potency and act; hence, those possessing a habit are compared to those who are asleep. But in God there is most perfect act. Act, therefore, is not in Him as a habit, for example, science, but as the act of considering, which is an ultimate and perfect act.

[4] Further, habit is perfective of a power. But in God there is nothing in potency, but only in act. A habit, therefore, cannot be found in Him.

[5] Moreover, a habit is in the genus of accident, which in no way is found in God, as was shown above. Neither, therefore, is any virtue said of God as a habit, but only according to His essence.

[6] Now, since human virtues are those by which human life is directed, and human life is twofold, contemplative and active, the virtues belonging to the active life, so far as they perfect this life, cannot befit God.

[7] For man’s active life consists in the use of bodily goods, and hence the active life is directed by the virtues by which we make a right use of these goods. Such goods, however, cannot befit God, nor, therefore, can such virtues so far as they direct this life.

[8] Furthermore, such virtues perfect the ways of men in the domain of political life. Hence, for those who do not take part in such a life the active virtues do not seem very suitable. Much less, therefore, can they suit God, whose conduct and life is far removed from the manner of human life.

[9] Of the virtues that deal with the active life some, likewise, direct the passions. These we cannot posit in God. For the virtues that deal with the passions take their species from the passions as from their proper objects; and so temperance differs from fortitude so far as it deals with desires, whereas the latter with fear and daring. But in God there are no passions, as has been shown, and therefore neither can such virtues be found in Him.

[10] Again, such virtues are not found in the intellective part of the soul but in the sensitive part, in which alone passions can be found, as is proved in Physics VII [3]. In God, however, there is no sensitive part, but only intellect. It remains, then, that such virtues cannot be in God even according to their proper natures.

[11] Of the passions, with which the virtues deal, some exist according to the inclination of the appetite to some corporeal good that is delightful to the sense, for example, food, drink, and sex. For the desires of these passions there are sobriety and chastity, and, in general, temperance and continence. Hence, because bodily delights are absolutely foreign to God, the aforesaid virtues neither befit God properly, since they deal with passions, nor are they said of God even metaphorically in Scripture, because there is no available likeness of them in God in terms of a likeness of some effect.

[12] Some passions, however, follow the inclination of the appetite to some spiritual good, such as honor, power, victory, revenge, and the like; and concerned with their hopes, their darings, and in general their desires there are fortitude, magnanimity, gentleness, and other like virtues. These, properly speaking, cannot be found in God, since they deal with passions, but in Scripture they are said metaphorically of God, because of a likeness in effects. For example, what is said in 1 Samuel (2:2): “There is no one as strong as our God”; and Micah [rather, Zephaniah 2:31: “Seek the just, seek the meek.”



Chapter 93

THAT IN GOD THERE ARE THE MORAL VIRTUES THAT DEAL WITH ACTIONS

[1] Now, there are some virtues directing the active life of man that do not deal with passions, but with actions: for example, truth, justice, liberality, magnificence, prudence, and art.

[2] Since, however, virtue derives its species from its object or its matter, and since the actions that are the matter or the objects of such virtues are not repugnant to the divine perfection, neither do these virtues, according to their proper species, have anything on whose account they are excluded from the divine perfection.

[3] Again, these virtues are certain perfections of the intellect and the will, which are principles of operation without passion. But in God there are intellect and will, lacking no perfection. Therefore, these virtues cannot be absent from God.

[4] Moreover, of the things that come into being from God the proper model is in the divine intellect, as was shown above. Now, the model in the mind of the maker of the thing to be made is art. Hence, the Philosopher says in Ethics VI [4] that “art is the true model of things to be made.” Art, then, is properly in God. And therefore it is said in Wisdom (7:21): “the artisan of all things has taught me wisdom.”

[5] Again, the divine will, with reference to things other than God, is determined to one effect by His knowledge, as was shown above. But the knowledge directing the will to act is prudence; for, according to the Philosopher in Ethics VI [5], “prudence is the true notion of the things to be done.” There is, therefore, prudence in God. And this is what is said in Job (12:13): “With Him is prudence and strength.”

[6] Furthermore, it was shown above that because God wills something He also wills those things that are necessary to it. But that which is necessary to the perfection of each thing is due to it. Therefore, there is justice in God, to which it belongs to give to each one what belongs to him. Hence it is said in a Psalm (3.o:8): “The Lord is just and loves justice.”

[7] Moreover, as was shown above, the ultimate end for which God wills all things in no way depends on the things that exist for the sake of the end, and this either as to being or as to some perfection. Hence, He does not will to give to someone His goodness so that thereby something may accrue to Himself, but because for Him to make such a gift befits Him as the fount of goodness. But to give something not for the sake of some benefit expected from the giving, but because of the goodness and befittingness of the giving, is an act of liberality, as appears from the Philosopher in Ethics IV [1]. God, therefore, is supremely liberal; and, as Avicenna says, He alone can truly be called liberal, for every agent other than God acquires some good from his action, which is the intended end.” Scripture sets forth this liberality of God, saying in a Psalm (103:28): “When You open Your hand, they shall all be filled with good”; and in James (1:5): “Who gives to all men abundantly without reproaching.”

[8] Again, all things that receive being from God must bear His likeness in so far as they are, are good, and have their proper models in the divine intellect, as was shown above. But it belongs to the virtue of truth, as appears from the Philosopher in Ethics IV [7], for someone in his deeds and words to show himself such as he is. Therefore, there is in God the virtue of truth. Hence, Romans (3:4): “But God is true”; and the Psalm (118:151): “All Your ways are truth.”

[9] But, if there are any virtues that deal with notions belonging to subordinates in relation to their superiors, such cannot befit God: for example, obedience, worship, or something of the sort that is due a superior.

[10] If, furthermore, some of the aforementioned virtues have certain imperfect acts, the virtues in question cannot be attributed to God according to those acts. Thus, prudence, according to the act of taking good counsel, does not befit God. For, since counsel is “a certain inquiry,” as is said in Ethics VI [9], and the divine knowledge is not inquiring, as was shown above, to take counsel cannot befit God. Hence Job (26:3): “How you have counseled him who has no wisdom!”; and Isaiah (40:14): “Whom has He consulted: and who has instructed Him?” But as to the act that consists in judging the matter of counsel and choosing what has been approved, nothing prevents prudence from being said of God. Nevertheless, counsel is at times said of God. This is either because of the likeness in privacy, since counsels take place in private, so that what is hidden in the divine wisdom is called by likeness counsel, as appears in Isaiah in the other version: “May Your ancient counsel be verified” (25:1 Septuagint); or in so far as He gives satisfaction to those who seek His counsel, since one who has understanding can, even without any discursiveness, instruct the inquiring.

[11] In the same way, justice, as concerns the act of commutative justice, cannot befit God, since He does not receive anything from anyone. Hence Romans (11:35): “Who hath first given to Him and recompense shall be made him?” And Job (41:2): “Who hath given me before that I should repay him?” Through a likeness, however, we are said to give some things to God in so far as God looks with favor upon our gifts. Commutative justice, therefore, does not befit God, but only distributive. Hence, Dionysius says that “God is praised for His justice as giving to all according to their worth” [De div. nom. VIII, 3]. And in the words of Matthew (25:15): “He gave... to every one according to his proper ability.”

[12] We must observe, however, that the actions with which the above virtues deal, do not according to their natures depend on man; for to judge of the things that are to be done, or to give or distribute something, does not belong to man alone but to any being possessing an intellect. Yet, in so far as these are narrowed to the human sphere, in a manner they receive their species from them, as the curvature in a nose produces the species of the snub. The aforementioned virtues, therefore, according as they order man’s active life, are ordered to these actions in so far as they are narrowed to human affairs and take their species from them. In this manner they cannot befit God. But in so far as the aforementioned actions are taken in their generality, they can be attributed even to divine things. For just as man is a distributor of human goods, such as money and honor, so too God is the distributor of all the goods of the universe. The aforementioned virtues, therefore, are of a more universal extension in God than in man; for as the justice of man is to the community or the household, so the justice of God is to the whole universe. Hence, the divine virtues are said to be the exemplar virtues of ours; for the things that are contracted and particularized are the likenesses of certain absolute beings, just as the light of a candle is to the light of the sun. As for the other virtues, which do not properly befit God, they do not have an exemplar in the divine nature, but only in the divine wisdom, which contains the proper likenesses of all beings: this is the case with other corporeal beings.



Chapter 94

THAT IN GOD THERE ARE CONTEMPLATIVE VIRTUES

[1] Concerning the contemplative virtues there can be no doubt that they supremely befit God.

[2] For if wisdom consists in the knowledge of the highest causes, according to the Philosopher in the beginning of the Metaphysics [I, 2], and if God especially knows Himself, and does not know anything, as has been proved, except by knowing Himself Who is the first cause of all things, it is manifest that wisdom must most especially be attributed to Him. Hence Job (9:4): “He is wise in heart”; and Sirach (1:1): “All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always with Him.” The Philosopher also says in the beginning of the Metaphysics [I, 2] that wisdom is a divine possession, not a human one.

[3] Again, if science is the knowledge of a thing through its cause, and if God knows the order of all causes and effects, and thereby knows the proper causes of singulars, as was shown above, it is manifest that in a proper sense there is science in Him. Nevertheless, this is not the science caused by ratiocination, as our science is caused by demonstration. Hence 1 Samuel (2:3): “For the Lord is the God of all knowledge.”

[4] Furthermore, if the immaterial knowledge of some things without discursiveness is intellect, and God has such knowledge of all things, as was shown above, there is therefore intellect in God. Hence Job (12:13): “He hath counsel and understanding.”

[5] These virtues, likewise, are in God the exemplars of ours, as the perfect of the imperfect.



Chapter 95

THAT GOD CANNOT WILL EVIL

[1] From what has been said it can be shown that God cannot will evil.

[2] For the virtue of a being is that by which he operates well. Now every operation of God is an operation of virtue, since His virtue is His essence, as was shown above. Therefore, God cannot will evil.

[3] Again, the will never aims at evil without some error existing in the reason, at least with respect to a particular object of choice. For, since the object of the will is the apprehended good, the will cannot aim at evil unless in some way it is proposed to it as a good; and this cannot take place without error. But in the divine knowledge there cannot be error, as was shown above. God’s will cannot, therefore, tend towards evil.

[4] Moreover, God is the highest good, as has been shown. But the highest good cannot bear any mingling with evil, as neither can the highest hot thing bear any mingling with the cold. The divine will, therefore, cannot be turned to evil.

[5] Furthermore, since the good has the nature of an end, evil cannot enter the will except by turning away from the end. But the divine will cannot be turned from the end, since it can will nothing except by willing itself. Therefore, it cannot will evil.

[6] And thus it appears that free choice in God naturally stands abiding in the -good.

[7] This is what is said in Deuteronomy (32:4): “God is faithful and without any iniquity”; and Habakkuk (1:13): “Your eyes are too pure to behold evil, and You cannot look on iniquity.”

[8] By this is refuted the error of the Jews, who say in the Talmud that at times God sins and is cleansed from sin; and of the Luciferians, who say that God sinned in ejecting Lucifer.



Chapter 96

THAT GOD HATES NOTHING, AND THE HATRED OF NO THING BEFITS HIM

[1] From this it appears that the hatred of something does not befit God.

[2] For as love is to the good, so hatred is to evil; for to those we love we will good, and to those we hate, evil. If, then, the will of God cannot be inclined to evil, as has been shown, it is impossible that He should hate anything.

[3] Again, the will of God is directed to things other than Himself, as has been shown, in so far as, by willing and loving His own being and His own goodness, God wills it to be diffused as much as possible through the communication of likeness. This, then, is what God wills in other things, that there be in them the likeness of His goodness. But this is the good of each thing, namely, to participate in the likeness of God; for every other goodness is nothing other than a certain likeness of the first goodness. Therefore, God wills good to each thing. Hence, He hates nothing.

[4] Furthermore, from the first being all the others take the origin of their being. If, then, God hates anything among the things that are, He wills it not to be, since to be is each thing’s good. He wills, therefore, the non-existence of His own action by which that thing is brought into being either mediately or immediately. For it was shown above that, if God wills something, He must will the things that are necessary for it. Now, this is impossible. This is apparent if things come into being through His will, for then the action by which things are produced must be voluntary. The same is the case if God is by nature the cause of things, for, just as His nature is pleasing to Him, so whatever His nature requires is pleasing to Him. God, therefore, does not hate anything.

[5] Moreover, that which is found in all naturally active causes must be especially found in the first cause. But all agents in their own way love their effects as such: thus, parents love their children, poets their poetry, and artists their works. All the more, then, does God not hate anything, since He is the cause of all things.

[6] This is what is said in Wisdom (11:25): “For You lovest all the things that are, and batest none of the things which You hast made.”

[7] However, God is said by similitude to hate some things, and this in a twofold way. In the first way, because God, in loving things and by willing the existence of their good, wills the non-existence of the contrary evil. Hence, He is said to have a hatred of evils, for we are said to hate what we will not to exist. In the words of Zechariah (8:17): “And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his friend and love not a false oath. For all these are the things that I hate, saith the Lord.” These, however, are not effects in the manner of subsisting things, to which properly love and hate refer.

[8] The second way arises from the fact that God wills some greater good that cannot be without the loss of some lesser good. And thus He is said to hate, although this is rather to love. For thus, inasmuch as He wills the good of justice or of the order of the universe, which cannot exist without the punishment or corruption of some things, God is said to hate the things whose punishment or corruption He wills. In the words of Malachi (1:3): “I have hated Esau”; and the Psalms (5:7): “You hate all workers of iniquity: You destroy all who speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.”



Chapter 97

THAT GOD IS LIVING

[1] From what has already been proved it necessarily follows that God is living.

[2] For it has been shown that God is understanding and willing, and the acts of understanding and willing belong only to a living being. Therefore, God is living.

[3] Again, to live is attributed to some beings because they are seen to move themselves, but not to be moved by another. And on this account the things that seem to be moved by themselves, whose movers people in general do not perceive, we call by similitude living: for example, the living water of a flowing spring, but not the water of a cistern or a stagnant pool; or quicksilver, which appears to have a certain movement. For, in a proper sense, those things move through themselves that move themselves, being composed of a mover and something moved, for example, animate things. These alone we properly say are living, while all other things are moved by some exterior agent, be it a generating cause, or one removing an obstacle, or an impelling cause. And because all sensible operations involve motion, everything that moves itself to its own operations is further said to live, though this be not with motion; and so understanding, appetition, and sensing are actions of life. But it is supremely true of God that He does not act from another, but through Himself, since He is the first agent. Therefore, to live belongs to Him in a supreme way.

[4] Again, the divine being comprehends every perfection of being, as has been shown. But to live is a certain perfection, which is why living things in the order of being are higher than non-living things. Hence, the divine being is living. Therefore, God is living.

[5] This is likewise confirmed by the authority of the divine Scripture. For it is said in Deuteronomy (32:40) in the person of the Lord: “I will say: I live forever”; and in a Psalm (83:3): “My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.”



Chapter 98

THAT GOD IS HIS LIFE

[1] From this it further appears that God is His life.

[2] For the life of the living being is the very act of living signified in an abstract manner, as running is in reality nothing other than to run. Now, “to live is for the living their very being,” as appears from the Philosopher in De anima II [4]. For, since an animal is said to be living because it has a soul, through which it has being as through its proper form, it follows that to live is nothing other than such a being arising from such a form. But God is His own being, as was proved above. Therefore, He is His own act of living and His own life.

[3] Again, understanding is a certain way of living, as appears from the Philosopher in De anima II [2]; for to live is the act of a living being. But God is His own understanding, as was shown above, and therefore He is His own act of living and His own life.

[4] Moreover, if God were not His life, since He is living, as has been shown, it would follow that He would be living through the participation of life. But everything that is through participation is reduced to that which is through itself. Therefore, God would be reduced to something prior, through which He would be living. This is impossible, as is apparent from what has been said.

[5] Furthermore, if God is living, as has been shown, there must be life in Him. If, then, He is not His own life, there will be something in Him that is not He.. Thus, He will be composite, which has been disproved.” Therefore, God is His life.

[6] This is what is said in John (14:6): “I am... the life.”



Chapter 99

THAT THE LIFE OF GOD IS EVERLASTING

[1] From this it appears that God’s life is everlasting.

[2] Nothing ceases to live except through separation from life. But nothing can be separated from God, since every separation takes place through the division of something from something. It is therefore impossible that God cease to live, since He is His life, as has been shown.

[3] Again, everything that at times is and at times is not is through some cause, for nothing leads itself from nonbeing to being, since that which does not yet exist does not act. But the divine life has no cause, as neither does the divine being. Hence, God is not at times living and at times not-living, but He always lives. Therefore, His life is everlasting.

[4] Furthermore, in every operation the agent abides, even though at times the operation passes through succession. Hence, in motion likewise, the movable remains the same in subject during the whole motion, although not in situation. Where, therefore, the action is the agent itself, of necessity nothing there passes through succession, but the whole remains all together. But the understanding and living of God are God Himself, as has been shown. Therefore, His life has no succession, but is life all together. Therefore, it is everlasting.

[5] Moreover, God is absolutely immobile, as was shown above. But what begins to live and ceases to live, or in living suffers succession, is mutable. For one’s life begins through generation, it ceases through corruption, and as to succession, it exists because of some motion. But God neither began to live, nor will He cease to live, not in living does He suffer any succession. Therefore, His life is everlasting.

[6] Hence what is said in Deuteronomy (32:40) in the person of the Lord: “I live forever”; and in 1 John (5:20): “This is true God and life eternal.”



Chapter 101

THAT GOD IS BLESSED

[1] It remains from the foregoing to show that God is blessed.

[2] The proper good of every intellectual nature is blessedness. Since, then, God is intelligent, His proper good will be blessedness. But He is not related to His proper good as is something that tends to a good not yet possessed, since this belongs to a nature that is movable and existing in potency; He is related rather as that which alreadypossesses its proper good. Therefore, He not only desires blessedness, as we do, but enjoys it. Therefore, He is blessed.

[3] Moreover, that is supremely desired or willed by an intellectual nature which is most perfect in it; and this is its blessedness. But the most perfect thing in each being is its most perfect operation. For potency and habit are perfected by operation, and so the Philosopher says that ""felicity is perfect operation"" [Ethics X, 7]. But the perfection of operation depends on four things. First, on its genus, namely, that it be abiding in its operating cause. By an operation that abides in its cause I mean one through which nothing takes place but the operation itself: for example, to see and to hear. For these are the perfections of the beings whose operations they are, and can be ultimate because they are not ordered to something made as to their end. On the other hand, the operation or the action from which there follows some result beyond the action itself is the perfection of the thing produced, and not of the operating cause, and is related to it as to an end. Hence, such an operation of an intellectual nature is not blessedness or felicity. Second, it depends on the principle of operation, namely, that it be the operation of the highest power. Hence, there is not felicity in us according to the operation of sense, butt according to the operation of the intellect, and one perfected by a habit. Third, it depends on the object of operation. On this account, the highest felicity in us consists in understanding the highest intelligible. Fourth, it depends on the form of the operation, namely, that it be easily, firmly, and with delight. Such, however, is the operation of God, since He is intelligent, and His the highest power, nor does He need any perfecting habit, because He is perfect in Himself, as was shown above. Furthermore, He understands Himself, being the highest intelligible, and this perfectly, without any difficulty, and with delight. God is, therefore, blessed.

[4] Furthermore, through blessedness every desire is given rest, because, when blessedness is possessed, nothing else remains to be desired, since it is the ultimate end. He must, therefore, be blessed who is perfect in relation to all the things that He can desire. Hence, Boethius says that blessedness is ""a state made perfect by the accumulation of all goods"" [De consolatione philosophiae III, 2]. But such is the divine perfection, because it comprehends all perfection in a certain simplicity, as was shown above. Therefore, God is truly blessed.

[5] Again, as long as someone is missing something that he needs, he is not yet blessed, for his desire is not yet at rest. Whoever, therefore, is self-sufficient, needing nothing, he is blessed. But it ha's been shown above that God does not need other things, since His perfection depends on nothing outside Himself, nor does God will other things for His own sake as though He needed them, but solely because this befits His goodness. Therefore, He is blessed.

[6] Furthermore, it was shown above that God cannot will something impossible. But it is impossible that God should receive what He does not already have, since He is in no way in potency, as has been shown. Therefore, He cannot will to have anything that He does not have. Hence, whatever He wills, He has. Nor does He will anything evil, as was shown above. He is therefore blessed, in the manner in which some proclaim the blessed man to be “be who has whatever He wills and who wills nothing evil.”

[7] Sacred Scripture, furthermore, proclaims the blessedness of God: “Which in His times He shall show Who is the Blessed and only Mighty” (1 Tim. 6:15).



Chapter 101

THAT GOD IS HIS BLESSEDNESS

[1] From this it is apparent that God is His blessedness.

[2] For His blessedness is a certain intellectual operation, as has been shown. But it was shown above that His understanding is His substance. Therefore, He is His blessedness.

[3] Again, blessedness, since it is the ultimate end, is that which he who can have it, or has it, principally wills. But it was shown above that God principally wills His essence. Therefore, His essence is His blessedness.

[4] Furthermore, everyone relates to his blessedness whatever he wills. For it is what is not desired for the sake of something else, and that in which terminates the motion of the desire of someone desiring one thing for the sake of another—so that the motion may not be infinite. Since, then, God wills all other things for the sake of His goodness, which is His essence, it is necessary that, just as He is His essence and His goodness, He be His blessedness.

[5] Moreover, that there be two highest goods is impossible. For, if one lacked something that the other had, neither would be highest and perfect. But God was shown above to be the highest good. Blessedness will also be shown to be the highest good because it is the ultimate end. Therefore, blessedness and God are identical. Therefore, God is His blessedness.



Chapter 102

THAT THE PERFECT AND UNIQUE BLESSEDNESS OF GOD EXCELS EVERY OTHER BLESSEDNESS

[1] From what has preceded we may further examine the excellence of the divine blessedness.

[2] The nearer something is to blessedness, the more blessed it is. Hence, although a man may be called blessed because he hopes to obtain blessedness, in no way does his blessedness compare with the blessedness of the one who already possesses it in act. But the thing nearest to blessedness is blessedness itself. This has been shown of God. Therefore, God is in a unique way perfectly blessed.

[3] Again, since delight is caused by love, as has been shown, the possession of what is Joved. But, other things being equal, each thing loves itself more than another, and a sign of this is that the nearer a thing is to something else the more it is naturally loved. God, therefore, delights more in His blessedness, which He Himself is, than do other blessed ones in the blessedness which is not they themselves. The desire has therefore all the more repose, and the blessedness is all the more perfect.

[4] Furthermore, that which is through its essence is more excellent than what is said by participation: for example, the nature of fire is found more perfectly in fire itself than in things that are on fire. But God is blessed through His essence, and this befits no other being, since no being other than He can be the highest good, as can be seen from what has been said. And thus, whoever other than God is blessed, must be called blessed by participation. The divine blessedness, therefore, excels every other blessedness.

[5] Moreover, blessedness consists in the perfect operation of the intellect, as has been shown. But no other intellectual operation can compare with God’s operation. 11is is evident not only because it is a subsistent operation but also because by one operation God knows Himself as perfectly as He is perfect, as well as all other things, those that are and those that are not, the good and the evil. But in all other beings with an intellect, the operation of the intellect is not itself subsistent, but the act of something subsistent. Nor, again, is God Himself, Who is the highest intelligible, understood by anyone as perfectly as He is perfect, since the being of no thing is as perfect as the divine being, nor can the operation of any being be more perfect than its substance. Nor, still, is there another intellect that knows also all the things that God can make, for then it would comprehend the divine power. And even as to the things that another intellect knows, it does not know them all by one and the same operation. God, therefore, is blessed above all things beyond compare.

[6] Again, the more something is united, by so much the more are its power and goodness more perfect. But a successive operation is divided according to the diverse parts of time. Its perfection, therefore, can in no way be compared to the perfection of an operation that is all at once without succession, and this especially if it does not pass away in a moment but abides for eternity. Now, in God, to understand exists eternally all at once and without succession, whereas in us to understand implies succession because continuity and time are by accident joined to it. Hence, the divine blessedness infinitely excels human blessedness, as the duration of eternity excels the flowing now of time.

[7] Furthermore, weariness and the various cares with which perforce our contemplation in this life is mingled (in this contemplation human felicity especially consists, if by chance there is such in the present life), and the errors, doubts and hazards to which the present life is exposed show that human felicity, especially that of the present life, cannot at all compare with the divine blessedness.

[8] Moreover, the perfection of the divine blessedness can be observed from the fact that it includes within itself every blessedness in a most perfect way. For contemplative felicity God has the most perfect and everlasting consideration of Himself and other things. For active felicity He has the government, not of the life of one man, or of a household, a city, or a kingdom, but of the whole universe.

[9] As for false and earthly felicity, it contains no more than a shadow of that most perfect felicity. For it consists in five things, according to Boethius [De consolatione philosophiae III, 2]; namely, in pleasure, riches, power, honor, and fame. But God enjoys a most excelling delight in Himself, as well as a universal joy in all things, without the admixture of any contrary. For wealth, He has the all-abundant sufficiency of all good things within Himself, as was shown above. For power, He has His infinite strength. For honor, He has the primacy and rule over all beings. For fame, He has the admiration of every intellect that knows Him however little.

To Him, then, Who is singularly blessed, be, honor and glory unto the ages of ages. Amen.",St. Thomas Aquinas,1961,"[86, 43, 37, 31, 41, 53, 59]",7

He uses all the great quotations
Says the things I wish I could say
Whoa, but he's has so many rehearsals
Girl, to him it's just another play but wait


When the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Girl, I'll be there to take you home

And I miss you tonight
I'm so sorry we drifted apart

And my memory strays
To those wonderful days
When you kissed me
And called me sweetheart

All the chairs in the parlor
Seem empty and bare
As I gaze at the doorstep
And picture you there

Now my heart's filled with pain
Take me back once again
Yes my dear
I'm so lonesome tonight

[Spoken]
Yes my darling
I'm lonesome tonight
I realize now that world is a stage
And each of us must play a part

I know too that
Fate sometimes acts in strange ways
Yes, act one is where we met
And I too loved you at first glance
But I guess I didn't really read my lines too well

Then came act two
Heh, I've never changed
There was a misunderstanding
I know now that I shouldn't have you listen to a so-called friend

The truth is, my love
That she wanted you for her own
You don't really have to doubt me
Nor must you go on without me

Yes, the stage is bare
But please wait there
Because I'm coming to you darling
And we'll be together
When they bring the curtain down

That boy Crooked I's equivalent to four arms
Joell Ortiz is the body
The cannibal-slash-killer: kill you, then eat your body
Joe Budden is the pair of legs
He run shit, alongside I, the apparent head

Run up on you with an army, it is
On till it's done, finished
You got a problem with any one of my Slaughters

I don't squash the beef, I don't bend a bit
It ain't intricate
I'm gon' shoot yo' stupid ass
You choose to laugh
You gon' die smilin, try wildin'
I get hostile then I'm violent

Turn your appearance to a disappearance

Guess that's why I'm the torso
I pour sweat when I perform shows
What I record goes down as the best
But the vets won't let that torch go
Y'all can keep it, they got flashlights now
And flame-throwers, and I got one on my back right now
Remain focused, that's what I tell myself now and then
Don't wanna go back to that block like where Varejao defends
Uh-oh, my stomach growls again
I ain't none of you cowards' friends
Every human out of my sight, before I count to ten (Woo!)
One two three four five six seven eight
I'm hungry like I never ate
Set a table up with knives, forks and spoons
I'm 'bout to get a plate
All these weak dummies lookin' yummy like a pepper steak
Me and these streets'll never separate, we ain't married
Yeah but every time I touch a pen I sorta set a date
I'll devastate your career, look I'mma demonstrate
Let me get a good breath I take before I regulate
Okay, bye-bye you guys, don't try to rhyme
'Cause line for line, what I design, is mine and mines
Point is I'm divine and I'm right behind the big guy that shines
All the light in mine
So my eyes can find a nice dime to grind
C'mere girl, toma, toma, take that, take that

Doing silly things

I'm Pacquiao in the Philippines, illest thing them niggas seen
You rappers dressing like you finna sing ""Billie Jean""
I gotta intervene; fuck you, I'mma intervene
You loud talking wouldn't kill a thing
Matter of fact, where's your head, nigga? I got the guillotine
Fuck your Hollywood limousine and rented bling
I give you three red dots and I call it a triple beam
I'll put your pad on your property, fag
Properly rob you and hop in the Jag
If you stopping the profit, the Glock'll be popping
Your body'll rock a colostomy bag
Shot in the abs, moms'll be sad
Pops'll be mad, doctor be glad
Possibly stopping the plasma dropping
Clock running out and the outcome bad
Any one of you niggas that's fucked with my team
Pretty-ass thing with the infrared beam
Sleep on that and get killed while you dream
Fuck a rap group, Slaughterhouse a machine
Slaughterhouse a regime
I'm gooned up if you know what I mean
Everybody wanna be down with the king

My one goal's to astonish
Tell the President, V.P., (You could) notify the Congress
They say I'm arrogant, pompous but I'm honest
I tell 'em keep an accomplice away from the accomplished
They still making threats on your highness
But I tell 'em where I be, they just ignore the compass
I think all your mans Play-Doh
I don't buy that movie, ""Fandango""
Fans they know that, what!
You a soldier to a general, baby steel
Got it in the bag, airtight, Navy SEAL
Tell lil' dudes I ain't mad at y'all
College kids like Asher Roth
Y'all just trying to put food on the table
Well, I'ma just come and try snatch it off
If it ain't for me
Most young dudes'd be angrily (Whoa, whoa)
But anxiously awaiting bankruptcy
Wonder what makes lil' muh'fuckers think they're the same as me
I'm synchronized, you and your mans'll die
Learn certain shit you ain't meant to try
Got the ground covered with some niggas in disguise
Best bet's to attempt to fly
Shit's a gang, you down, you in for life
Fuck y'all, I ain't gotta generalize
Y'all ain't able to write what the pen describes
So when he asked what I meant and why, I tell him

683,Many Tears Ago,"A long time ago in a far off place
I got caught up in a pretty place
Diamond eyes that stole my heart away
I was young and so naive
I never thought that you'd ever leave
But you packed your bags and left for Santa Fe
And now you're at my door again
Askin' me to take you in
But darlin' this time things won't work that way

Many tears ago, I thought I loved you
Many tears ago, I thought my heart could never break
But oh, the pain you put me through
Was more than I could take
So take your memory and go
'Cause that was many tears ago

Time goes by and feeling fade
But I still have my lonely days
When I can't help myself for feelin' blue
'Cause Lord knows I've tried to forget
But sometimes I still lie in bed
Close my eyes and all I see is you
But you never felt the way I did
So I tell myself again
Just what tonight I'm tellin' you

[Verse 1]
Well believe me I've tried but there's no explaining
Eyes piled up you look like a painting
Saintly and sexy, the soft-spoken wind blows
Uncertain curtains cover broken windows
In desperate need of a safe haven and inflamed
I walk around Paris, unshaven and ashamed
20 odd years since last time I slow danced
Teenage crisis and the end of romance
I see myself in the form of a wolf
Furry down on all fours and worried
Uneven colours and the echoes of fly tones
Connections I've lost in a collection of jawbones
Apples and oranges, you decide which
I'm writing graffiti on suicide bridge
I once knew a woman who was clever and tough
Who said too much make up is never enough
Her eyelids were heavy with words and desire
She lives underwater with the birds and the fire
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche
If you like love you'll love this, most likely

[Bridge]
You and me are meant to be that's right I love you
Can't you see, whatever partner you do choose you have the ability to marry
6, 7, 8, I'll never hurt you you know
Husbands love their wives
Yeah, love the woman
Part of me is here with you
One life, where my heart beats for you
Well, here we are again
Here's a couple, treacherous
I'm impatient in relationships in and love
When will you see quand allez-vous me voir

Tell me what is it is, Gee Whiz, I don't think I know

[Verse 2]
Bird girl sorry I'm too sleepy to make
But the sounds of my dreams always keep me awake
Don't wanna scare the birds away so I speak soft
Memories like the shows of Vanessa Beecroft
Her bedroom philosophies are so perplexing
But I think these two wooden legs are so sexy
Cries of sadness spectacular
You be Rossy de Palma and I'll be your Dracula
Fist is of agony decorate the last room
Shoes by the door on the floor is your costume
Open the trunk with the car key, the odd way
Love songs call me the marquee de shad
Lord of the files you lost me I wonder how
Midnight meet me at the entrance for the underground
So many questions but I'm afraid to ask
So I whisper them to apollinaire by Picasso
I touch all the flowers and break the chain

Had to get off my ass, man I had to try man
I got to get a bag even if it's five bands
I remember hitting licks for them flatscreens
On hard streets, I been trying to serve them crack fiends
I remember them days I ain't have no clothes
I remember them days I was kicking doors
I remember mama saying I'm a bad child

Locked up in the cell, I couldn't get a penny

I was fuckin' with lil shawty, bought her everything
Stay one hundred to the grave, ain't gon' never change
Shout out to my mama, put her through so much pain
I remember all them shootouts that we had with them other niggas
My bitch got mad and fucked another nigga
Man that shit was crazy, ain't gon' lie it made me heartless
Fell in love with money, it's gon' stay with me regardless

Alright

Hello baby, tell me why you keeping me so far
If you had a new lover, you and the Dapper used to spar
Candlelight at dinner, having shark and caviar
I heard his name is Radics, when we buck then it's a war
And all your friends are saying he's a London Super Star

For the transcendental run
The train now standing
Leaves for higher planes
Due to a derailment
There will be no other train
So why not hop on this one?
Hear the porter's glad refrain

Each carriage is connected
As is every single train
The rails all form a track
Which is a link within a chain
The chain's connected
To another chain now
You will need no ticket
If you wish to ride on this train

All aboard the express Kundalini
All aboard the express Kundalini
All aboard the express Kundalini

The song is in your heart
Your heart is in the song
The song is of the earth
The song is of the sky

You are disintegrating
Into everything around
Reintegrating
The worm we dug from higher ground
You have let go of ego
Ego is no longer you
Closer to nirvana
Since the porters whistle blew

Nine and nine make fourteen, four and four make nine
The clock is striking thirteen I think I lost my mind
You know it's getting aggravating
How long can I keep waiting?
Tell me if you love me yes or no

Oh, how much I need you
Have pity on this heart of mine
Well, if you need and want me too
I'll be your one and only till the end of time

[Куплет 1]
(Дайджест)
Мы открыли дверь
Ты не сомневаешься, кто говорит за Пермь теперь
Теперь они базарят обо мне
Но я перевожу каждое их слово в новый куплет
И ты знаешь: никакого коллаба с фальшивками
Мы кидаем в гримерке пожитки
Весь персонал обтёк еще на чеке
Знаешь, меня тоже плющит с собственной читки
Есть новый проц с касс, где спать-срать
Паркплац или плацкарт
Лететь, ехать, Як, «Боинг», «Гетц», «Логан» старый
Эскорт или S-класс (Дайджест)
Они все в хлам, я давно не спал, гемоглобин вниз
Но я ловлю такс, и я готов взять этого журавля и нахуй твоих синиц

[Бридж]
На инструментале, как Бог
Да, в этом бокале любовь
За вот этот новый айфон
Ёб её под новый альбом
Время на поспать — это на кон
Снова развожу этот огонь
Хочешь — ори, хочешь — сломай себе ногти
Только не делай следов

[Предприпев]
Ну, и как я могу не получить доступ?
Как-как я могу не получить доступ?
Раз-два, и все подруги накидались в доску
Раз-два, и мой патрон у нее рядом с мозгом
И мы рушим клуб у тебя на глазах
И мы не спали месяц, но мы льем им Bosca
Еще пару минут, и я вернусь назад
И никакой пощады, хочу порно-оскар

Это дайджест (Дайджест)
Это все, что мы делаем в пару барс
Это все, что мы делаем в пару барс
Это все, что мы делаем в пару барс

Это все, что мы делаем в пару барс
Это все, что мы делаем в пару барс
Это все, что мы делаем в пару барс
Это дайджест

[Куплет 2]
Не могу поверить, что я никому не могу поверить
Мой старый характер убит, а мой внутренний мир
Этот корабль упёрся в берег (god-damn!)
У этого бита нет сердца, у микрофона нет на меня планов
Сзади догорает мост, а рядом никого, и только твои ноги тебя не обманут
Папа говорит: «Если сумеешь поменять что-то сам в этой музыке, тогда делай
Ведь это все, что ты можешь, это тебя не покинет, это тебе дали гены»
Они говорят, что я selfish, но заливают со мной в соцсети селфи
Потом они желают нам упасть вниз, но я будто бы собрал каждый клевер с логотипа Celtics

[Бридж 2]
(Убей их)
Я могу либо работать, убивая новый бит, либо до ебанного талого тусить
Это не было, нет и не будет для меня дело выбора
Ведь у меня, как минимум, тут половина сил еще в запасе
Я вижу, ты перепутал флоу с этим модным калом
Окей, перемотай еще раз, подними челюсть, удали секвенсор и не порти карму

For I find you, the love of my life in somebody else's arms
Your eyes are echoing ""Perfidia""
Forgetful of the promise of love
You're sharing another's charms

With a sad lament my dreams are faded
Like a broken melody
While the gods of love look down
And laugh at what romantic fools we mortals be

And now I find my love was not for you
And so I take it back with a sigh
Perfidia's won goodbye

700,Don't Read The Letter,"[Intro:dravin ]
Man What should I do, I don't really know
But then agian, why am i here
I feel like a broken record, cause over and over I keep asking this same question
But it dont really matter, cause they never listen to me, not even my own parents
But now i’m just siting here, asking what the fuckin point?


[pre-Chorus: Josh]
Man whats the point, i feel like I'm locked up in the joint
But I'm all outta joints, so whats the point
Some one Please help me, cause i don’t get it, cause they never get me (never get me)


[Chorus: Josh]
In this cold dark world, I'm all alone
Looking for my home, but i broke my phone
But  what's. The point of being here, if nobody ever gets you
I'm just so tired of liying, when I'm dying inside
Why am I doing the time, when I did no crime
Im just tired of pretending to be like the rest, when i know I'm not
Cause unlike the rest,  I'm okay with how the story ends
Yeah i like to smoke, but I'm broke, all outta joints
So shats the point of being here if nobody gets you



[Verse 1:get litty]
Yeah we’re  lit,  but no one ever gets us
Walk around a stranger, people be calling us the danger
Marry gave birth in a manger, i was born in a change so I hang her
People always trying to shit on us, but we shit on rapers everyday
So like 8.1.3. Boy get out my way, cause today’s a brand new day
They wanna say they got skills across the floor, but i just closed the door
Mama always said, when one door closes, another one opens
Maybe that's right, maybe that’s not
See I don't really know, cause we were to poor to buy a door
They say we all got a window of time, but they too busy listening to them chymes
To notice that it might be my time, cause my windows bolted shut
Lost the key, but its all okay
Causw life be like this game, but I never cared about the fame, cayse that shit is just lame
That's why i don't play with your blame, boy i just light the flame
Cause I’m tired of playing your games,  so stop puting the blame on me
Cause i don't care about the fame, cause that shit is lame
So i just throw it in the flame, cause thats the only way I'll play your games


[pre-Chorus: Josh]
Man whats the point, i feel like I'm locked up in the joint
But I'm all outta joints, so whats the point
Some one Please help me, cause i don't get it, cause they never get me (never get me)

So shats the point of being here if nobody gets you



[Verse 2:dravinjesberger]
So some one Please tell me the point, cause I feel like a broken record
Cause round and round i spin, like i'ma sin
Tell me to take a brake, but I ain't gonna rake it up
Fuck a make up, cause i ain't fake like jake Paul and that's just everyday bro
But this pain is starting to make me go insaine, i'ma go off my chains
Cause I'm just not getung it, how are you geting lit
I spit bars far far away, so y'all stay away
Cause Jaden just came home with lice, I just rolled the dice, mom where's the spice
I'm cold as  ice, but I ain't no vannila ice, cause I'm precise
But y'all just sit there and be lit, I ain't gonna throw a fit
Y'all be saying your  lit, but i still don't really get it
Then agian how would i know, cause no one even listens to me, not even my own parents
Cause People always rushing me, they be  trying to push me down
But everytime I fall, I just keep getting right back up, yet i call but never get any backup
That's why everyday I gotta keep telling my self to just  keep going
Over and over in my head, like a broken record
I keep telling myself that it will get better if i don't read the letter
That all the pain I feel that one day it will just go all away, But deep down inside I know it won't
So mom and dad, keep asking why I haven't smiled in a while
Cause it's hard to smile, when you've been through it all
But they say trust is a must, but how could i trust them when they be lying through there teeth
I'm just tired of all you fakes, so one shot, dump the body in the lake
I'm tryna take a break, but mama don't belive in no breaks
So maybe that's why I hate to fly, cause i know that one day there lie's will kill us all
I'm just tired of there lie's, boy I ain't gonna cry
But every time I ask them, why they lying to me?
Shit falls out there mouth, like a lil kid throwing a fit
Cause they say they lied, cause that thought that was best for me
But how would they know what's best for me, if they don't even know me
So Pam stop acting like we're homies, cause bro you don't even know me
Like a wave y'all digged your grave, I ain't gonna be y'alls slave
I'm tired of all the lie's, now y'all got me lying here, dying inside(dying inside)


[pre-Chorus: Josh]
Man whats the point, i feel like I'm locked up in the joint
But I'm all outta joints, so whats the point
Some one Please help me, cause i don't get it, cause they never get me (never get me)

Scappo dai sorrisi gialli come Kill Bill
Voglio un picnic, fanculo Just Eat
Timberlake o Bieber, l'importante è che sia just in
Non guardarmi così, I'm a rich bitch
Ti interrompo la festa come un cazzo di blitz
Yeah, give me five, perché il mondo è bello
Non capisco se è un casello o un McDrive
Baci baci, bye
Con la tua gang mai
Se mi stai lontano è meglio, tu e le tue bad vibe
I miei fratelli fumano come se fosse sport
A te non ti vediamo perché c'è troppo smog
Guarda che noi non ti odiamo, siamo peace and love
Il flow ti ha travolta, baby, come John
Tiriamo forte, ci crediamo a San Siro
Gas soporifero e reclama il condominio
Se arrivano le guardie noi giochiamo a nascondino
Sei pronto a prenderle? Scegli: classico o alternativo
Uh, ho gli occhi addosso come Monna Lisa
Mia mamma conosce tua madre, non sei mia cugina
La pensilina dice che è in arrivo e non arriva

Mandala, mandala, manda Mandela
Cinque in condotta e brucio la pagella
Hmmm, happy day
Faccio comunella solo con i miei
Mi disp, non ti risp, stai sul display
Tienimi il volante: sparo a questi fake
Non fare mai sentire le tue cicche, no
Non cambiare mai, mai per due feedback, no
Ti mando a casa, poi diventi triste oh
Tu mi mandi a casa solamente pizze oh

Spacchi solo quando te ne sbatti il c-

You'd rather live without me
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone

In the summertime
When all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'Cause you don't want my love

Once upon a time
You used to smile and wave to me
And walk with me but now you don't
'Cause you don't want my love

Some other guy
Is takin' up all your time
Now you don't have time for me
'Cause you don't want my love

You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone

In the summertime
When all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be danged

It's finally here
A second leaned
The only thing to save us from the curse of hate
A blackbird sky, merciless fate
We fell down deep into the curse of hate

[Verse 2]
Deny, deny
But it's too strong
And it's exactly what you wanted all along
Make up your mind
Which side you're on

705,"Tonite, Tonite","Tonight, tonight, while I'm holding you so near
Tonight, tonight, what I'd give if I could hear
The three little words that would thrill the heart of me--
Just whisper, ""I love you, and will eternally.""

Tonight, tonight, more than any time before
This heart of mine seems to need you so much more
The touch of your hands, the thrill of your embrace
Keep saying that no one will ever take your place

While looking up afar
I wished upon a star
And prayed for a blessing from above
Now, if my wish should come true
Until our life is through
I'll have you, dear, to have, to hold and to love

Well, tonight, tonight may never reach an end
I'll miss you so 'til you're in my arms again
With all of my heart, I declare with all my might
I'll love you forever, as I love you tonight

706,The Puppet Song,"[Verse 1]
Taken way too soon, I'm not at all what used to be
Shifting in a box, the past is nothing more than just a dream
Now I hear the call of evil growing once again.
I'm powerless to change your fates
But in the end I'll shelter you my friends

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we roam, and if they listen really close
They can hear us sing our song
(La la la la)

[Chorus]
And I can't give you back the things you had.
But you don't have to do this on your own
Even if you're never coming home
You're not alone,
You're not alone

[Verse 2]
In our own little world, forever lost to passing time
No one knows what it's like to wear a mask that you are trapped inside
One day the purple clouds that hover over us will fade
Then we'll be free to cut the strings
To wipe the tears, but now
we walk in chains

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we roam, and if they listen really close
They can hear us sing our song
(La la la la)

[Chorus]
And I can't give you back the things you had.

I miss you tonight

Yes, darling

I'm lonesome and blue
I still love you, dear

-Dafuq do you mean ""Where’s my DJ?""
-What do you mean DJ you know what a DJ is, where's your DJ at?
-I don't need a fucking DJ, that’s too much money in my goddamn pockets, that means I'm gonna be broke. Not gonna have no goddamn money, but anything..FUCK THAT!
-Yo, you need to get yourself a DJ [?]..what's up with that?
-Yo, fuck that. What the hell I mean that shit for? I got me myself and my rhymes(aight?)

[Verse:]
Ay [?] once told me: ""Rap is the business and hip-hop is the culture""
Where cultivation of an .. expression for mind stimulation
Yet the elements or elementary degrees
Vary from [?] to lyrical flows and backspins to cutting and scratching
Or even just relaxing to a live, take you wanna joy a ride type of vibe
But can be created through our art forms, express through our songs
While devoted to keeping hip-hop strong
But if hip-hop is indeed a culture, our culture, then why is our foundation slowly breaking, breaking and drifting down the bottomless abbyss?
We have allowed our foundation to be manipulated, raped and given back to us in a form we can not quite [?] our own
Without an equilibrium, our four main ingredients:
MCing, DJing, B-Boying, Graffing
Have been lost and get found
Within a quote unquote ""Rap-shuffle""
[?] 2 fold card that MC and a DJ [?] in hand
Across the Hip-Hop land
But now that MC works with an electronic device
Uses slate of demise of the turntablist, turntablist, turntable is.....
..the turntablist is the guy [?]
Using their turntables as the instruments
They incorporate sound bits to make my head split
From the symphonic delivery
A musical entity that lives infinitely
Turntablist that have created turbalance [?]
Roc Raida swifting his [?]
[?] the crowd into a zone
Takes me back away from home
I'm going back to Cali
While these spins [?] and manipulates the turntables to take us into his room
Where he annihilates our competition
Like Nas - It Was Written
The beat juggling precision
So now I'm gonna make it real funky for you
With that ""laid back mellow my man"" type rythm
Which rhymes with so delicately, but forcefully
Illustartes the jazz fusion
Is Brooklyn in the house? [?]
With quick hands and [?] patterns [?] puts the flavour in our ears
Can't you hear?
Mista Sinista the inavative change-the-pace type of melody funky in his expression
Swap rutine keeps the crowd want it more, and more, and more
Well though different they are the same
Dedicated to bring the Hip-Hop to a higher plane
Never allowing to [?] victim, to the corrupt system
Devines this..this...culture

712,A Perfect Love,"I try to paint pictures drawn from my world
A song is my canvas, brush strokes are words
But do i portray love, that is just my ideal
Like sculptures of stone that can never be real

For I am a man with romance in my soul
Do I cry for the moon as I reach for my goal
Looking for a perfect love
Longing for a perfect love

Born of such innocence, how little we save
Our spirits are tempered from cradle to grave
If one drop of virtue can somehow survive
From oceans of doubt all our dreams can arise

For I am a man with a child in his soul
I live on my hopes as I follow that road
Looking for the perfect love
Longing for the perfect love

A thirst for perfection is in every heart
Like the painter who won't be content with his art
For those who drink deeply, all dreams heavy wine
Look for heaven on earth, see a world more divine

Looking for a perfect love
Longing for a perfect love
Looking for a perfect love
Longing for a perfect love",Breathe (U.K),1961,"[53, 47, 54]",3

Like the sea and the sand
In a very private wonderland

To the crowded nights
And city lights we left behind
We love the dreams we share
And dare to live the dream

The sea in her serenity, silently
Casts a spell on you and me

""—perfectly fine, that's fine!""

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga, brother who you standing with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me ""Decapitate everything for what it's worth!""
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
See the canvas as a planet I'm commanding with my nerves, ah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Nothin' different now (woo!) all around now (woo!)
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena
Lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeño
Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

[Verse 3: Joba]
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Jaden]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing

Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us

Hoo! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to the church and I sang a hymn
Co-colonized Chris-ti-an
Now I'm losing my reli-gi-on
God damn, so narcissistic this millennium
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual
Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like the day

724,Ballad Of The Alamo,"In the southern part of Texas
In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins that the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses and you'll never see a one
But sometimes between the setting and the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marchin' by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for

Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo.""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo

""You may ne'er see your loved ones,""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay.""

In the sand he drew the line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancin'
On a horse that was black as the night

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousin' rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play degüello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Every one will be put to the sword!""

One hundred and eighty five
Holdin' back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were comin'
Never came, never came, never came

Twice he charged then blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed them, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers...

Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...

In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazin' where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazin' and the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly...

To the men of Alamo...

To the thirteen days of glory
At the siege of Alamo...",Marty Robbins,1961,"[46, 39]",2
725,How To Handle A Woman,"[ARTHUR]
""How to handle a woman?
There's a way"", said the wise old man
""A way known by every woman
Since the whole rigmarole began""

Do I flatter her? I begged, him answer
Do I threaten or cajole or plead?
Do I brood or play the gay romancer?
Said he, smiling, ""No indeed""

""How to handle a woman?
Mark me well, I will tell you, sir
The way to handle a woman
Is to love her, simply love her
Merely love her, love her, love her""

""How to handle a woman?

There's a long list of mistakes you've made, King

To put it kindly, King:
What? Did you expect me to agree?

And made the biggest harbor of tea you'll ever see

They found cancer in her chest
My lil homie momma maine, they talking about cutting off her breasts
Ran hella test, mammograms and stuff
Nervous breakdown her husband left when it rains it pours it's rough
Somebody got shot today and everybody knows who did it
It's easy to kill a man but its harder to live with it
Karma used to take three years but now it only take thirty minutes
The victims family shed they tears Memorial Day they go to visit
The grave site the rest of the place were the family members layn
And then they light a candle and put flowers on it maine

One girl you're everything to

Fame if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found her, build your world around her

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too

[Instrumental break]

Yeah
Once you've found her
Now build your world, build your world around her
Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too
Make someone happy, oh
And you will be happy, too",Stevie Wonder,1961,[80],1
744,I Idolize You,"If you want some loving
That I can give to you
And if you want some hugging
Said I can hug some, too

All I want, baby, now
Is some thought of you

And just a little of your affection
You know, will see me through

'cause you know that you are my man
And I want you to forever be mine
I idolize you (yes, she idolize you)",Ike & Tina Turner,1961,[82],1
745,Talk To Me Baby,"[Verse]
If you cannot toss your heart gaily in the ring
Love me while the moment lingers
If you cannot cross your heart that i'm everything
Try at least to cross your fingers
Talk to me, baby, tell me lies
Tell me lies as sweet as apple pie
Whisper you tremble with a wild desire
To light the fire in my eyes
Tell me i'm marvelous, exaggerate!
Prevaricate if you must
Just talk to me, baby, soft and low
Then if you decide it's really so
Swear you be mine forever, otherwise just talk to me
And tell me lies, lies, lies, lies
Great, big, great big lies",Ray Charles,1961,[93],1
746,This Is My Story,"[Chorus: K Hoody]
Ridin' in foreign with my niggas
The opps they be hurting our feelings
Killing my people
Now we marching the streets for the freedom
This is what made me nigga
This is what changed me nigga
This is my story
Momma we made it out

[Verse 1: K Hoody]
Didn't do it just to say I did it
All new everything
Why y'all keep acting faded
Bought a new chain cause I'm with it
Acting invited cause I did it
Nigga stop mother fucking talking
Did it on my own
Did it with two brothers they put me on
No fake niggas around me
Everyone around me got put on
This is that real shit
This is that kill shit
Bando to the trap to that fanta
Why y'all keep acting like wesley
This shit is crazy
Acting all reckless
Chasing the gold
Surfing the crowd
Bape season crazy
Supreme goin' wild
Nexus on the beat
I never go lazy wit it
Mav on the beat
I'm never gon' wave it nigga
This shit is crazy
Put it on god that we making it

[Verse 2: Manny Nexus]
To make it is all I want
Gon' celebrate with the real ones
Ain't no one gettin' in my way
Cause I'll be grinding from day to day
At some point it all pays out
Got all these fake dudes having doubts
The more they talk the more I laugh
At the end of the day I know I don't slack
Hustlers moving to pay they debt
Ones who are jealous wanna see you dead
It's stuff that we see and we stay shut
And the ones who change it are none
To earn respect you got to break a law
Now a days people wanna be all talk
From day to day people crying
Cause like Machi real people dying

[Chorus: K Hoody]
Ridin' in foreign with my niggas
The opps they be hurting our feelings
Killing my people
Now we marching the streets for the freedom
This is what made me nigga
This is what changed me nigga
This is my story
Momma we made it out

[Verse 3: Mav The Prodigy]
All my chains on like Lil Uzi Vert
Gotta grind like I'm Lil Boosie work
All our people dead cause they let that uzi squirt
No I'm not Rihanna they see me doing dirt
Momma's kids dying and families they are hurt
Stealing all our money and scamming we be burnt
I only trust fam they like who's he is he Durk
Had to be complex cause I'm crazy with this verse
I'll body this beat and then put it in a hearse
Flow so cold that I had to get a nurse
Lyrical prayers had to spit em' in a church
Google who's the hottest and I will be the first
Came from being broke and my life it was the worst
Now what the fuck am I a blessing or a curse

[Verse 4: K Hoody]
Put in the grind while y'all sleeping
Not going broke cause I'm keeping
Changing ones to hundreds
And now it's all even
I'm just sneaker feelin'
Buying designer cause it's all fashion
Frozen all over the body
The chains gotta be in the freezer
Thirty miles from city to city
It's coming and coming
The money falling out of my pocket cause it's getting longer
Bullets flying building to building
Sirens just screamin' and screamin'
I'm just putting reps for the city
Counting these big racks
I ain't really fuckin' with feeling
This is my story
I'm balling how I want it
Twenty Three on my back
And I'm drafted from high school
Young nigga balling from nothing
I feel like I'm stuntin'
I put in the work to distribute the people
Finding the route to dat way
Always rode down the trap way
I put my singles out on Dat Piff
All she want is my money
Try and flex it on the gram hoe
I just ran up on your main hoe
Blue strips all up in the hundreds
Me and the bros pulled out a foreign

[Chorus: K Hoody]
Ridin' in foreign with my niggas
The opps they be hurting our feelings
Killing my people
Now we marching the streets for the freedom
This is what made me nigga
This is what changed me nigga
This is my story
Momma we made it out",K Hoody,1961,[100],1
