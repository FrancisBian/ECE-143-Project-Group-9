0,Lose Yourself,"[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

[Verse 2: Kyjuan]
Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

[Verse 3: Ali]
Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

[Verse 4: Murphy Lee]
Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 5: Murphy Lee]
We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

[Verse 6: Ali]
I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

[Verse 7: Kyjuan]
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

[Verse 8: Nelly]
Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 9: Kyjuan]
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

[Verse 10: Murphy Lee]
Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

[Verse 11: Nelly]
Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Verse 12: Ali]
Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine , (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

5,Beautiful,"[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful

Yeah, to my babies: stay strong

I like your little sexy style
Love it when you getting wild
Girl in the club with me
Girl, you need to be in magazines
Wear a crown on your head cause you're a ghetto queen
Like bling bling bling
The way you shaking that sexy ass
Your body shaped like an hour glass
Baby we need to spend some time
I wanna get you to myself
Me and nobody else
And do the things we do
Baby there is something that I need from you

[Chorus: B2K + (Omarion)]
Baby turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump

I can't take it, baby)

[Verse 2: Omarion + (P.Diddy)]
I love the way you're teasing me
Gonna have to stop pleasing me
While we're on this floor
You're kicking it round and round
I love the way you put it down
You're making me scream for more
Put your 2-way next to mine
Baby hit me anytime
You and me behind closed doors
You're about to be my main squeeze
Take trips, cop shiny things
Girl just come with me
Now, mama, go ahead do the damn thing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Dance for nothing mami, plans to take her by me
Get on the floor, make it bump more, shake it, mami
Let's ride, I'm your Clyde, you can be my Bonnie
See you the type for me, mami, so right for me
Man she can move it, love when she dance to the music
Make me wanna stand like a pool stick
Hands is the smoothest, just a simple touch make me lose it
Girl, that's enough; stop movin'
Now bump that, I pump that, girl, bring it to me bump that
I want that girl to sing it wit me like
(La la-la la-la la la la, La la-la la-la la la la)
So let's do it again, mami, you and a friend, mami
Money ain't a thing, look, what I gotta spend mami?

Shake it like you can honey, take it from your man, mami

You know some real bad tricks

And you give me the most gorgeous sleep

I guess it's not that bad

'Cause underneat' it all, you are my real Prince Charmin'

Aside from your temper, everything else secure
You’re good for me, baby, for that, I’m sure

Y'all know how I met her
We broke up and got back together
To get her back, I had to sweat her
Thought she'd roll with bad boys forever in many ways
Them boys may be better, to grow, I had to let her

Looking for cheese, that don't make her a hoodrat
In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me

11,Gimme The Light,"[Olli Banjo]
Just gimme the Light!
Uh! *Drama Monks*
Meine Leidenschaften bedeuten der Welt ein Dreck!
Meine Leidenschaften...

[Verse 1 - Olli Banjo]
Ich bin nicht einfach zu handlen
Ich bin ein Freigeist mit Flausen und Eigenheiten in dreifacher Menge
Ich fühl mich oft einsam
Ich drohe an der Oberflächlichkeit der Menschheit zu zerbrechen, es macht das Loch weiter
Ich sitz zwischen zehn Menschen
Nicht ein einziges Themengebiet tangiert mich im geringsten, ich sehe leere Menschen
Ich bring mich ein mit dem Satz ""Fick die Welt!"", die Runde staunt
Ging es doch eben noch um Nettogehälter und Kundentausch
In einem Raum voller naturalistischer Stillleben
Bin ich verstörende moderne Kunst, keiner will mein Bild sehn!
Sie sehn mich wie Dadaismus ohne Idee dahinter, dumm und menschlich
Abstrakt im besten Fall interessant, aber unzugänglich
Ich sprenge ihre Werteskala, ich bin der Härtefall
Ich gehe nicht zum Trendfriseur, hab deswegen heut nichtsmehr zu sagen
Eure Herzen sind mir zu klein, Motive wertentladen
Die Tüten zu groß und die Witze zu vorhersehbar!
Ihr zwingt mir den Komplex auf, die Mehrheit macht den Staat
Ihr besetzt den Begriff normal, alternatives wird brandgemarkt
Um eure Fehler mir auf die Fahnen zu schreiben
Fehlt es mir leider an Arroganz..

[Hook - Olli Banjo]
Just Gimme the Light!
Es is nass und dunkel hier
Ich bin allein und kann nichts sehn
Just Gimme the Light!
Wo sind all die Lichter hin?
Wo sind die Menschen die mich verstehn?
Just Gimme the Light!
Es ist düster und dunkel hier
Ich bin allein und ich kann nichts sehn
Just Gimme the Light!
Ich will ans Tageslicht
Ich will die Sonne noch einmal sehn!
Just Gimme the Light!

[Verse 2 - Olli Banjo]
Warum guckt ihr mich so an? Ich bin nicht aussetzig
Ich bin anti, kontra, dagegen, ich bin aufsessig
Ich bin mein eigenes Konzept, ich lebe freimündig
Mein Leben sind Profis, in der Kreisklasse, Bayern München
Ihr wärt gerne V.I.P., very important
Bist du im geborgten Porsche important?
Kommt in meinen Club zum seelischen Bypass
Und ich sperr extra für euch den geistigen Bereich ab
Ich grab unter feuchte Hände, Schütteln und Kinnhaken
Eine Nische zwischen Großstadtbauern und Provinzadel
Ihr seid Katalogmenschen, Seele kommt per Nachnahme
Als Bonus für lästige Werte der passende Sargnagel
Ich sehe leere Menschen, leere Zimmer, leere Häuser
Leere Millionäre, leere Flaschen, leere Säufer
Ich leere ohne was zu lesen meinen Posteingang
Ich fühl mich oft wie ein Außenseiter, ich bin oft einsam

[Hook - Olli Banjo]

[Verse 3 - Schivv]
Die letzte Frage: Worum gehts?
Und alles seh'n, denn die Wege ensteh'n beim geh'n
Und das versteh'n beim drüber Reden und Schreiben, Reisen und Leben
Statt leiden, schweigen und quäl'n, eigentlich wenig
Doch eigentlich mein' ich mehr nicht
Zumindest weiß ich nichts, deswegen reichts mir eigentlich
Alles ist gut, solange du tust was du kannst
Und mit dem was du in der Hand hast
Und wo du bist mit dir im Frieden bist
Denn da gehts lang, man muss nur anfangen
Ich schalt das Licht an, seh dein Bild
Mich dann und fühl mich ganz an
Ey un ich hass nich wirklich Rechtsanwälte
Doch ich kann spür'n echte Kälte
Schlechte Wellen, schlechte Quellen, schlechte Werte
Und ich bin sicher, echte Stärke heißt nicht ungereche Härte
Darum bleib ich sicher nett mit dir und mir, weils mir das Wert ist
Und weil es ist, wie es ist und weil es war, wie es war
Und schließlich kommt, wie es kommt
Ist alles wahr, rein und klar
Aber echt und ich bleib weit mehr, als rechts, links, dunkel und hell
Denn wir sind alle echt schöne Kinder
Punkt, und so speziell...

She said she love me when I'm gone
She miss me being home
I'm always at the studio that makes her alone
Recently she even seems to hate on all my songs
Deleted my pictures took my face up out her phone
Where did we go wrong I'm sitting here thinkin'
She said the weed too strong, it keeps my breath stinkin'
Dizzy high, I ride away in my Lincoln
Close my eyes and fly away but no blinking
I'm just dreaming she ain't really screaming
It goes both ways and I was trying to get even
Lost my whole evening mostly for no reason and
Just my broken weaslin', now I'm trying to ease it in
Came home late I just put the key in
It would probably be straight if she was european
She's not she's hot and mad as she can be
If you can hate on anybody girl I'm glad it was me

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
She hates me, I know it I kno'
She hates me, I know it for sure
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me again

I mean it started with the rose petal, ended with the stem
By the car, while I was thinking ""Damn here we go again""
We used to hold hands and had such a deep convo
Make a few plans like you wanna go where I'mma go?
Well let's leave pronto and thats what we did
Then we yelled out geronimo and jumped off that bridge
Had a couple kids, you can move where I live
I know old ass niggas that's scared to do what I did
The shoe still fits but I'm wearing out the sole
Sometimes I really feel as if I'm burning out my soul
I should have a live band preparing for my show
But instead everybody keeps dick riding my flow
Now I know I ain't quite rich, but bitch I ain't broke
If she acting like a bitch, I guess we're around white folk
Forgive me if I raise my voice I won't raise a hand
But one thing I will do baby is raise my little man

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, “You make me sick”
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart’s half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can’t see you bouncin’ with somebody else
It’s a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn’t give it up
I can’t let us self-destruct

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’mma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do

No more games callin’ you foul names
Actin’ like females is all the same
I’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I’ll never be the same
I’mma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time I’mma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin’s gonna tear us apart, promise

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways

Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do

Yehey

And girl I know it's you, cause you complete me
And I just don't want you leavin'
Even though I give you reasons

Cause baby sometimes, I can tell just by your faces this part of us been gone for so long
And I know there's no replacing what we had going on for so long
But when it hurts, I can make it better
Girl if it works, it's gone be forever
We been through the worst, made it through the weather
Our problems and the pain (pain), but love don't change, ooh ooh

And you still make me know that you need me
And I know sometimes you don't believe me
But you stay on my mind, so believe me

Girl when times get tough, don't hate me (ohhhh)
And it all adds up, we gone make it (gotta make it)
Cause when you mad, I know you can't fake it (ohhhhhhhhh)

18,Thugz Mansion,"[Intro: 2Pac]
Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & (2Pac)]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family

You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder‚ I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

[Pre-Chorus]
You want love‚ we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em

Please come now I think I'm falling

It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say

Hold me now

And I'm thinking maybe six feet

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out, ""Heaven save me""

24,All I Have,"[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
When I'm on the mic, that's fine, but that don't scare me
It's been a long time, but I'm back now
Rap pow, welcome to the rap house
Rap pow, will live 'til I pass out
Blackout, blackout, everybody keep on wonderin' if I still rap now
Are you serious?
Anybody out there hearin' this?
Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines
You've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready cause you might find
I'm from a different place, and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead
It's just been in mournin'
From the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen, I'm warming up and you're misinformed if
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough
Then I'll skip the chorus
I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the doors ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice, hold it
What am I insane maybe? Plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
You do what you wanted but you can't contain me, lazy
Is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line
This is the current condition of my state of mind

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was somebody to get this
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
Yeah, take my song, put it on their playlist
And get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us
If that's my calling or not, Father, maybe I should just not bother
Go back to that nine-to-five, but I am not a quitter so quit that
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Tryin' to make an impact in rap, is that insane?
Well, I guess so
Rap though, better give me that pencil
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental
I am in a place where I can't let go, agh!
I still work a job and do this, and y'all know what's stupid?
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal, and, your things start moving
But that's not the case, because most of the times—the artists you hear
You keep on thinking that artist is new, but that artist has prolly been at it for years
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking, am I wasting my time dreamin'?
And I ain't got no money in my wallet, but I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this
I need this, I swear to y'all, I need this
And this hip-hop's in my veins, if you cut me I'ma bleed it
And, yo, what you think I write raps for? No reason? No
Take my pain and I put 'em in a song—ever since them pills, they took my mom
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
I stand behind these words here, I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect
Don't tell me to calm down, I'm calm now, listen, I'm just working
Yeah, it might take a minute to get it, but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
I don't think they see my vision here, I don't think they see my vision here!

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
All I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real (this isn't real, this isn't real)
This is all that I have, this is all that I have",NF,2002,[25],1

Top down, chrome spinning
You see the boss grinning, I'm loving these damn women
I let two get in, she tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, ""Naw love, that's forbidden""
I ain't for squishing, that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them 20's real well
Now we coasting, me, two chicks and toasting
I turn up the volume, watch the bass get 'em open
Soft spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they lovin' the ride
We was moving bodies before we hit the party
Before the DJ started cutting (I was already fucking)
Cinderella'd you girls; from nothing to something
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumping
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the V.I.P., I got new moves to make

Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy
We gets in for free—""Ay, they with me""
Two stepping, you see each crew repping
Slipping on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweating
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do something to me
Come this way and prove something to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm toting
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

When they say, ""Last call"", it don't mean the night's over
It mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, asked Pusha to choke her
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it? The whip appeal or my baby face?

[Verse 4: Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leaning
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-two's gleaming
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning
She added to the list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinning and my head spinning
Mine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chin and
I'm a winner, man

Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark

Мой отец — КГБшник, а моя мать — с автоматом (да)
И мои дети — солдаты карательных батальонов
А мои братья — блюстители наших тёмных районов
Чувства юмора и нет, ведь так бы я давно смеялся
Над жизненной ситуацией, в которую загнал себя
Нет верёвки? Пусть тогда меня удушит галстук
Поскорей бы умереть, ведь я живу напрасно
Маколей Калкин и Галкин — мой Новый год, он снова гадкий, у
Что принесёт мне Санта, где подарки, может быть, жену?
Если русский Дед Мороз, тогда он принесёт войну
Шутники и юмористы развалили нам страну
Чё, смешно, сука? Чё ты там услышал? (пау-пау)

Пьём пиво с пацанами — это Тайная вечеря
Я играю в гонки с мусорами, это всё не вечно

Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice

I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing

I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing

[Verse 1]
Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk-asses
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song to me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)

You will know the difference when I touch you

See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway

Point to her they say, ""Wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""Yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a-like
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your... brain)

Got a safe in the wall behind paintings of Mona Lisa
Chandeliers in the hall
Ten stuffed deer heads are on my living room wall
More bills than Stills & Nash
I like to flash, cause I got more stash than Johnny Cash
Gold faucets on my sinks
Inside of my bedroom I got at least 20 fish tanks
I got power, and I'm known
See, I can call the President up straight on that red phone
So now you know what my game is
It's the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

[ VERSE 3 ]
I get the opposite sex
Cause while I write out checks, diamonds are shinin in my Rolex
My clout is outrageous
I'm on the phone with the owners of casinos in Las Vegas
Lookin heavy every day
I wear a pair of shoes once, and I'm throwin em away
Everything is like a breeze
I hired MP's just to guard all my ki's
Girls throwin lillies in my path
I got a yacht that makes the Love Boat look like a life raft
Mega-mega-mega-bucks
To make a deposit, I gotta call up armored trucks
Smilin while I'm stylin
I gave a girl her first lesson in sex on the Virgin Islands
Cause I'm the real money maker
More bread than a baker, the dead-president undertaker
A young brother gettin notes
I flew to London for the fog, just because I had the coat
So much money to spill
Whoever's not in my will might even get a mill
You want a car? That's miniture
No cash, don't sweat it, because my credit is my signature
My name should be Amos
Cause I'm livin the lifestyle of the rich and the famous",Kool G. Rap & DJ Polo,2002,"[47, 53, 61]",3

[Intro]
It's 50 a.k.a. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of livin' to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

[Verse 1]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9?
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
If D's ran up in my crib you know who droppin' dimes

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin

[Verse 2]
Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
The fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar
If you play with my paper you gotta meet my Beretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out

[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

[Bridge]
Me I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

[Verse 3]
'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I gotta eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they goin' murk 50, how?
We ridin' round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

[Verse 1]
Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

[Chorus]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

[Verse 2]
Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I've got nothing to hide
On and on, I've got nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

51,Red Rag Top,"[Verse 1]
I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just as wild as we were green, in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

[Chorus]
In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

[Verse 2]
Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel

We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

[Chorus 2]
On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

[Verse 3]
We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins

And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped

She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even (girl, I know)
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God?
Betrayal, trust, this thing of ours  (GIRL!!)
Should be secretly held sacred, 'cause I love it when you pop your body-body
And move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi and rub up alongside me

But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is you need my heat (Ja!)

She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

58,I Just Wanna Be Mad,"Last night we went to bed not talking
'Cause we'd already said too much
I faced the wall, you faced the window
Bound and determined not to touch

We've been married seven years now
Some days it feels like 21
I'm still mad at you this morning
Coffee's ready if you want some
I've been up since five
Thinking about me and you
And I've got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while

For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't want to go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile

59,A Lot Of Things Different,"[Verse 1]
I'd spend a lot more time in the pouring rain
Without an umbrella
Covering my head
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed
And called me names
But I was too afraid
And I'd a gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town
But mama said I couldn't
And I'd a-went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson
That time she dared me to
But I didn't

[Chorus]
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different

[Verse 2]
I wished I'd a spent more time with my dad
When he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
I wish I had told my brother how much I loved him
Before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
And I wish I had gone to church on Sunday morning
When my grandma begged me too
But I was afraid of God
And I wish I would've listened when they said Boy
You're going to wish you hadn't
But I wouldn't

[Chorus]
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would

[Verse 3]
There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad
She could taste it
And I should have bought it'
But I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it
Blues and greens
But I wouldn't let her, wouldn't a-hurt nothing
She loved to be held and kissed and touched but I didn't do it
Not nearly enough
And if I'd a known that dance was going to be our last dance
I'd a asked that band to play on and on and on

[Chorus]
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different

[Outro]
People say they wouldn't change a thing, even if they could
Oh but I would

67,You Can't Hide Beautiful,"She says don't stare at me
She's afraid that I might see
Those 5 extra pounds she talks about
Man, I don't know what she's talking about

She looks through magazines
With every page she dreams of
Looking like somebody else
I wish she wasn't so hard on herself

Then she falls asleep with just my t-shirt on
But even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone

Chorus

You can't hide Beautiful
You Can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful, oh no

She can take a simple dress
Put it on and turn some heads
Man Everytime she moves she gets me
She doesn't even know she's sexy

And the way she thinks sometimes

No keys on the table

Walking through the doorway
I'm already looking up
One hand on the future
One hand on today
Although I know leaving ain't easy
I'm on my way

All the days gone by with no fire in my eyes
I'm ready for a flame to come
Need to chase these lights
While my youth is on my side
So I pick up my feet and away I run

Step back onto the road
And the troublemaker's back in the fold
I hear familiar voices calling me on
They say ""son, you've been away for too long""
Cause these are the days, these are the days
These are the days
Cause these are the days, these are the days
These are the days

Blood rushing at night

With a  brick of money hit her with a thou (owwww)
I laid it down let Pacquiao
Hit it so hard bitch threw in the towel
Twerk it now to my style
Watch them titties through your blouse
Move that kitty up and down
I be really in them clouds

Wish I was too dead to care

[Verse 1]
My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

[Verse 2]
My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Hard to the core
Core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton

No call on my celly, no name on my caller ID
Callin' you up and ya OGs sayin' you ain't home
What's really goin' on? I wanna know
So gimme a call and let's play no games
I'm playin', you want the plane
Don't point a finger over herre
I bought you a fur coat for your birthday
And this the things I get shorty?
Over there you starin' mad
That I went out with them other chicks
I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home
Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
I'll be waitin' at home

Put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go
Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
Cuz ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
Cuz I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'

Do you want to flash a light on?
Take a look it's on display for you
Coming down, no, not today
Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Picking up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind

I feel it more than ever

In a little while
Surely you'll be mine
In a little while... I'll be there
In a little while
This hurt will hurt no more
I'll be home, love

When the night takes a deep breath
And the daylight has no air
If I crawl, if I come crawling home
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
In a little while
I won't be blown by every breeze
Friday night running to Sunday on my knees
That girl, that girl she's mine
Well I've known her since
Since she was

A little girl with Spanish eyes
When I saw her first in a pram they pushed her by
Oh my, my how you've grown
Well it's been, it's been... a little while

[Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Slow down my beating heart

[Bridge]
A man dreams one day to fly
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies
He lives on a star that's dying in the night
And follows in the trail, the scatter of light
Turn it on, turn it on, you turn me on

Slow down my beating heart

Cause I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth, so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man, oh

Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks
And I got to do something special for me

Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Got to take time out

Tonight, it's all about me
Just want to set my body free
Never mind the TV

You always complain, when it's chicks that's starvin'

I used to support ya, I thought you'd appreciate
Some of these things that I bought ya
Shoes from Milan, Louis Vuitton
Animals on back and jewels on your arm

I don't want you at all now

Can you try and tell me
What made you choose her as your friend?

It's you again...

I would have bet the Dow Jones
If then compared to our fun, yeah
Imagine how crushing it was
For you to say I was not the one

Defendin' you as a perfect friend
Now new rumors have risen up (psst psst psst psst psst)

Explore and cover, the world as we know it

[Verse 4: Toni Braxton]
Damn, it's been so long since I head your voice last summer
To be honest it made me smile when I seen you number

Baby tell me why I should reconsider being your friend
Maybe some day in your dreams my love
You could say, ""damn it's you again""

Come on, lay back to attack in the 'Lac
We ain't cutting no slack, girl, what you know about that?

That we can keep it undercover when you wanna play
Blazed up, smoked out, out of my mind
We just cruise around my town all the time

If the city never sleeps, then, fuck it, neither will I
You know we keep it thirty-deep and we're as high as the sky
You can watch us thirty-creep as we just ride and we ride
You can watch the Fiesta drop from one side to side
We're breaking the boulevard 'cause we get it better
If ever you need to find me, bitch, you can send me a letter
Forever drunk and disorderly off this vodka I'm pouring me
Goddamn, man, I want it all, my city of glory!

'Cause it's all you got and that'll never change

102,Beautiful Mess,"[Verse 1]
When the world shakes us
Trying to take us out of line
Fear of tomorrow
Feelings we borrow for a time

[Refrain]
Water so deep, how do we breathe?
How do we climb?
So we stay in this mess
This beautiful mess tonight

[Chorus]
And we don’t have a thing to lose
No matter what they say or do
I don’t want nothing more
Our love is untouchable
Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable
Our love is untouchable

[Verse 2]
When the colours turn grey and the lights all fade
To black again
We’re in over our heads
But somehow we make it back again

[Refrain]
Water so deep, how do we breathe?
How do we climb?
So we stay in this mess
This beautiful mess tonight

And we don’t have a thing to lose
No matter what they say or do

You know you get the shit smacked outta you back where I'm from
Hold up, wait up
This shit is made up
Feel like I'm dreamin', I'ma wake up

106,I'd Rather,"[JANIS]
So your best friend screwed you over
Acted nice when she not nice
Well, I have some advice
‘Cause it’s happened to me. Twice

Here’s my secret strategy
It always works because
The world doesn’t end
It just feels like it does

So raise your right finger
And solemnly swear
""Whatever they say about me
I don’t care!""

I won’t twist in knots to join your game
I will say, ""you make me mad.""
And if you treat me bad
I’ll say “you’re bad”

And if I eat alone from this moment on
That’s just what I’ll do
‘Cause I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you

We’re supposed to all be ladies
And be nurturing and care
Is that really fair?
Boys get to fight, we have to share

Here’s the way that that turns out
We always understand
How to slap someone down
With our underhand

So here’s my right finger
To how girls should behave
'Cause sometimes what’s meant to break you
Makes you brave

So I will not act all innocent
I won’t fake apologize
Let’s just fight and then make up
Not tell these lies

Let’s call our damage even
Clean the slate till it's like new
It’s a new life for me
Where I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me
Than be with you

[JANIS]
I'll say, ""NO!""

[FEMALE STUDENTS]
NO!

[JANIS]
I’ll say, ""knock it off, with your notes
And your rules and your games.""
And those sycophants who follow you
I’ll remember all their names

And when they drag you down
Like they inevitably do
I will not laugh along with them
And approve their palace coup
‘Cause that’s not me

[FEMALE STUDENTS]
Janis! Janis! Janis! Janis

[JANIS]
I don’t need their good opinions
I have plenty of opinions
Everybody has opinions but it doesn’t make them true
What’s true is being me

[JANIS & FEMALE STUDENTS]
And I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you

[JANIS]
So raise them high ‘cause playing nice and shy is insulting my IQ

[FEMALE STUDENTS]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah

[JANIS & FEMALE STUDENTS]
I'd rather be me (I'd rather be me)
I'd rather be me (I'd rather be me)
I'd rather be me than be with you

107,Little Things,"[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam & Both]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I’ll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn and Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry & Harry and Louis & Harry and Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry and Niall & Harry]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge: Niall]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can choose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow

And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed, with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Holdin dat dough after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week - back to you

You can fly away, no one has to know
Babe take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario] And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em (Sacario: True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prob'ly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral (ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)

112,Trade It All,"[Intro: [?] & Joe Budden]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
It's that knock, right here
Word up
Just got a couple questions for 'em
Okay
It go

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Uh, here's something I'd like to know (Uh)
Would you trade it all? Would you put a price on your soul? (Answer that)
You more about the outcome or the income?
Would you give up your dreams to feel like you're living in one?
Faced with decisions, would you ignore intuition?
Trade in whatever drives you for keys to an ignition?
Or would you go on like your life fine?
It's funny how a moment'll change your lifetime
Yeah, would I be held as a villain
If I never helped with feelings? Change to sell a million?
Yeah, wonder what these fans'll say to me
Still'll garner some bravery, money never dictated me
'Cause my morals for cash just ain't a trade to me
Respect is important, niggas know not to play with me
It's not a void to fill, it's no vacancy
Take it all, there's no taking me, Joey

[Chorus: Emanny & Joe Budden]
I’m amazed
They always said I wouldn’t be here
So much in my way (Uh)
I’ve seen it all through these years (Uh)
It’s been give and take (Been give and take)
They thought I’d break (But)
But to trade it all (Uh)
Is no trade at all, at all

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
The ultimate contradiction
What started as a hobby now an honest way of living
Which took me to a genius from a pompous with a vision
Could do a dramatisation on the drama I've been given
Everybody says that, mine was kind of different
So every composition just to calm my inner prison
Armed and on a mission, strapped and only armed with my confliction
Never phased me, my only armor is this thick skin
Daddy talent (What else?), mama wisdom (What else?)
Master of deceit, I cheated through the honor system
Quit my temporary job, earned more
Left school, learned more, rehab then burned more
Tales of B&E's, toast and extortion
How my son was almost an abortion, I've been close to a coffin
Wouldn't do over this rollercoaster
Know it played out like it was supposed ta ([?] Joe)

[Chorus: Emanny & Joe Budden]
I’m amazed
They always said I wouldn’t be here
So much in my way
I’ve seen it all through these years
It’s been give and take (Not at all)
They thought I’d break (Talk to 'em)
But to trade it all (Let me talk to 'em like this)
Is no trade at all, at all (It go)

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Look, was froze over the phone
Waiting for you to change your tone while I was smokin'
But that never happened like I was hopin' (Nah)
Waiting for you to laugh, at least tell me you was jokin'
But you just kept on with the conversation
I'm tryna be calm and patient while pacin' around the room
Thoughts in my head are varied, that's you, grandpa and Mike
It's very scary, is cancer hereditary, Dad?
We had our little issues after ""Momma Said""
Glad that's behind us so we can cherish the time that's there
I got faith, I know the Lord'll have a say
But you got a daughter on the way, what more do I gotta say?
You got twins to raise, they just beginning to age
Tell God with a hint of rage it was meant for you to stay
If I gotta explain what should be understood
Yo, I'd trade me for you if I could, we all good

[Chorus: Emanny & Joe Budden]
I’m amazed
They always said I wouldn’t be here
So much in my way (Word up)
I’ve seen it all through these years (I seen it all)
It’s been give and take ([?] uh)
They thought I’d break ([?])
But to trade it all
Is no trade at all, at all (It go)

[Intro]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 1]
When you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
See, Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 2]
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but son I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again

[Verse 3]
Rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again and again and again",50 Cent,2002,"[100, 95, 74, 71, 75]",5

Have you bowed unto your highness?

Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2"", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and

Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

[Bridge: Jay-Z]
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion, losing my religion

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?

120,I Am Mine,"[Verse 1]
The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithin' and hopin' to buy themselves time
Me, I figure, as each breath goes by
I only own my mind

[Verse 2]
North is to south what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in-between is mine
I am mine

[Chorus 1]
And the feeling gets left behind
All the innocence, lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

[Verse 3]
The ocean is full 'cause everyone's cryin'
The full moon is lookin' for friends at hightide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine

[Chorus 2]
And the meaning that gets left behind
All the innocents lost in one time
Significant, behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

[Chorus 3]
And the feelings get left behind
All the innocents broken with lies
Significance between the lines
We may need to hide...

And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocence, lost in one time
We're all different behind the eyes
There's no need to hide...

121,Crush Tonight,"1 - [Ginuwine]
Baby, if you wit' it, just clap yo' hands
Stop playin' girl, back that ass up and
Spend that cash dog, drink the Henny and
Freak that girl like you tryna have a baby cuz

Everybody's out to fuck tonight
The fine women, they out to fuck tonight
My niggas, they down to fuck tonight
Ladies, fellas, the won't stop players

[Fat Joe]
Came through the door, seen it before
Hands touchin' the ceiling, booty streakin' the floor
You ever felt good to the point you so sure that
All the attention in the club is yours
Got your hair done up, shades Christian Dior
Leave us, trade a little happy on your Vickey draws
Gettin' your dance on hard, who could wish for more
And your crew's all but know it's a horse
Got the Don all warm and it ain't the Hen'
Feelin' like the Don woman, you could wrestle her chin
Shorty, come a little closer while the record spin
I wanna freak a little longer, can they play it again

Repeat 1

Yo, got my mind on my money, money on my mind
And to let you know, you just as good as gold
It's like we got our own little private party goin' on
And the scene just changed into shores of San Juan
It's so intimate, we so into it
Such a tender thing, but fuck I'm innocent
Grindin' so hard you gotta know what I'm thinkin'
Laughin' cuz I'mma kidnap you for the weekend
Now we at the pad about to crack a case
Playin' the couch like Ceasar's, she feedin' me grapes
Not for nuttin' hon, the sex is great
But you know you got to go, I got checks to chase... next

Repeat 1

[Ginuwine]
If you're wit' it grab your friends, follow Joe and me
Cuz it's on, it's on
Went in and got the Cris' and a pound of weed
It's on, it's on

[Fat Joe]
Now mami, let's get serious, cuz by the looks of it
It seems your sexuality is just a little curious
You got a friend, we could gather then split
If not, I got a girl for every girl I get
There's a drop in the lot and it whip so fast
We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass
And you know you wanna be where the cake is at
Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat
Mami, your body like Malery on Natural Born Killer
She like, they got money but ya'll are more realer
She wanna roll wit' us, pretty much to crit' us
No beatin' around the bush, just beatin' it 'till you bit us

122,American Child,"I was ten, I was thin, I was playing first base
With a secondhand glove and dirt on my face
In nowhere, Virginia
Who'd ever figure that kid in the yard would go very far

It was 419 Lakewood, had no silver spoons
Just an old beat-up upright that played out of tune
Now I'm singing and living the life that I love
And when I count my blessings, I thank God I was an American child

An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child

Seven pounds, three ounces, she's got my nose
And she's into my heart as deep as it goes
With a promise that's more than just someone's last name
Anyone's equal, in late August came an American child

An American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child

My grandfather would have been eighty today
But in '45 he fell down beside an American child

An American child
Oh, an American child
'Cause dreams can grow wild born inside an American child
Oh, an American child",Phil Vassar,2002,"[98, 90, 74, 60, 52, 48, 48, 53, 54, 54, 72, 62, 69, 76, 78]",15

Everyday I need an ounce and a half, S.P
The only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

Smoke like a chim-in-ney {*inhaling*}, matter fact I
Smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes, I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

I'mma smoke till my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue

124,Braid My Hair,"[Verse 1]
When you look at me, I know you see
A 16-year-old, getting his dough
Back and fourth to the studios
Hopping out limousines, rocking the latest jeans
Jordan's, fresh
T-Shirt, new
And even though these things are true
It's hard work and sometimes I just want to go home
And tell my girl...

[Chorus]
Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...

[Verse 2]
You may think that I'm complaining
But that's not the case, all I'm saying
Is my body gets weak, my mind gets tired
I need sleep, but I got to keep
Travelling on the road
Doing these shows
New York to Cali
Dallas to Philly
It's the rules of the game, that I chose to play
But sometimes I want to say
Baby won't you...

[Chorus]
Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...

[Bridge]
Sit me down like you love me
Do it anyway you want
Baby take it slowly
Front to back, side to side, criss cross
Get creative with it girl, do your thing
Put it down like you love me
Let your fingers do the walking and your lips do the talking
In my ear
Tell me what I want to hear
I swear
I can't wait for you to braid my hair...

[Chorus]
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my hood, feeling good
No worries or no cares
Baby, use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama in my life
While you braid my hair...

Do what you want to do
Baby its up to you
Sit me between your legs
Girl won't you braid my hair
Baby make me feel alright
And make it last all night
And take away the stress and drama in my life
Won't you braid my hair...

No worries or no cares

125,Flake,"[Verse 1]
I know she said it's alright
But you can make it up next time
I know she knows it's not right
There ain't no use in lying

Maybe she thinks I know something
Maybe maybe she thinks it's fine
Maybe she knows something I don't
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying

[Chorus]
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, not one
Likes to be let down

[Verse 2]
I know she loves the sunrise
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
And I know that when she said she's going to try
Well it might not work because of other ties and
I know she usually has some other ties
And I wouldn't want to break them, no, I wouldn't want to break them
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but
Until then, well, I'm going to have to lie too

[Chorus]
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, not one
Likes to be let down
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go

Even with all the money in the whole wide world

You're going to have to call it by a brand new name

Back when I was young
Couldn't wait to grow up
Get away and get out on my own
And looking back now
Ain't it funny how
I've been trying to get back home, yea
When my low self esteem
Needs a man loving me
And I find me a perfect catch
Then I see my friends
Having wild weekends
Then I don't wanna get quite so attached
Just as soon as I get what I want
I get unsatisfied
Good is good but could be better

[Chorus:]
I keep looking, I keep looking for
I keep looking for something more
I always wonder what's on the other side
Of the number two door
I keep looking
Looking for something more

[Verse 2:]
Well, the straight haired girls
They all want curls
And the brunettes wanna be blonde
It's your typical thing
You got ying you want yang
It just goes on and on
They say, hey, it's only human
To never be satisfied
Well I guess that I'm as human as the next one

Picture, if you will, that the throne's burning
Rome's burning, and I’m sitting in the corner all alone, burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don’t determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I’m sorry, but I just can’t die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I’ll be fly when Easter’s over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told, after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

Charge it to the game, whatever’s left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly, pelican, fly, turn the jets on it
But first I shall digress on it
Wasn’t I a good king?
Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?
Didn’t I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?
Huh, I gave you my loyalty
Made you royalty and royalties
Took care of these niggas' lawyer fees
And this is how niggas rewarded me, damn

When I walked in the band just started
The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket
Was on a mission to drown her memory but
I thought no way with all this ruckus

But after one round with Jose Cuervo
I caught my boots tappin 'long with the beat
And after two rounds with Jose Cuervo
That band was sounding pretty darn good to me

[Verse 2]
Then some stranger asked me dance
And I revealed to her my two left feet
Said, ""Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an ol' memory""

[Chorus]
Then after three rounds with Jose Cuervo
I let her lead me out on the floor
And after four rounds with Jose Cuervo
I was showin' off moves never seen before

Well, around five or round six
I forgot what I came to forget
After round seven or was it eight
I bought a round for the whole dang place!

The after ten rounds with Jose Cuervo
I lost count and started countin' again!

Said you weren't alone, but you'd call him soon
Isn't he the guy, the guy who left you cryin'?
Isn't he the one who made you blue?

When you remember those nights in his arms
You know you gotta make up your mind

Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you goin' back to the one you love?
Someone's gonna cry when they know they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above

What you gonna say when he comes over?
There's no easy way to see this through

I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away

That's why in front of your eyes, I'm invisible
But you've got to know small things also count
Better put your feet on the ground
And see what it's about, so

Away from here

With no one in the passenger seat
And no one to fight with me bout

I can't help but sing along

We could close the door and lock ourselves inside

The days all fly away and I forget the truth
Everything that matters, is, in this room

Breathing the air I breathe

Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it

More time to love

I want to take in all the beauty here

157,The Impossible,"[Verse 1]
We were two little people wrapped up in this big old world
Drifting 'round in space, out of place, just a boy and girl
Then you took my hand and made me a part of you
And I looked in your heart
And saw all my dreams come true

[Pre-Chorus]
You did the impossible (You did the impossible)
You rescued my love
You did the impossible (You did the impossible)
See, I had almost given up

[Chorus]
And now I love you like summer time
Love you like cherry wine
Love you like free money
Like a preacher loves Sunday
Love you like freeze pop
Love you like a milkshake
Love you like a high school girl on a first date
Love you like shootin' stars
Love you like a muscle car
Love you like we're destined
Love you like my lover and my best friend
Yeah, you did the impossible

[Verse 2]
Tonight, I'm gonna need all your attention
Close the door
I wanna do things I probably shouldn't mention
Like a bird, I'mma hum
Those three words ""I love you, I love you, I love you""
Freeze the time, let the world go by
If you're mine, say you love me, you love me, you love me
Boy, take my hand and make me a part of you
And the love that you gave to me has pulled me through

[Pre-Chorus]
You did the impossible (You did the impossible)
You rescued my love
Oh, you did the impossible (You did the impossible)
See, I had almost given up

And now I love you like sunsets
Bubble baths on the jet
Love you like Kool Aid
Louis Millionaire shades
Love you like Sugar Daddies
Love like a pimp caddy
Love like a holiday Duncan Hines yellow cake

Love you like an Asher cut pink and white engagement ring

158,The Good Stuff,"[Verse 1]
Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

[Verse 2]
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

[Verse 3]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

[Chorus 1]
Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Verse 4]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

[Verse 5]
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

[Verse 6]
He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Outro]
He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'

And drink it up

When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye

And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly man, it’s gonna be hell

And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

[Intro]
Hello?  Yes, this is Dana.  Who's speaking?
Oh, Jackie!  How you doing?
It's been a long time hasn't it?
Nah, there'll be none of that babe
My plan leaves in about an hour
I don't think so
My tour starts when I get back
But, um... thanks for calling anyway
It's been nice knowing you, well it was nice knowing you
You take care of yourself
Oh, and don't give out my number
Thanks

[Verse 1]
Now I can still remember when we first met
It was one day that I would never forget
Six o'clock the approximate hour
Not really cloudy, expecting sun showers
I was taking a stroll halfway cross town
Then like expected the rain came down
I picked up my pace
For home base I raced
Ran into a soft object in my haste
On the ground we faced
Her in silk and lace
And with my eyes, her body I slowly cased
The pouring rain had drenched her dress
But I loved the way the cloth had clinged and caressed
""Excuse me"", that was my first words spoke
Stood her up on her feet and gave her my trench coat
Somehow it happened while I covered her back
When her eyes and mine first made contact
The looks we gave changed the way we were
Now it was us and not me and her
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now even the rain pour was easy to ignore
Only this young lady is what I saw
She was a sweet female, tender not frail
Other words beautiful, no need for details
I introduced myself, ""Hi, my name is Dane
Can I get you out of this pouring rain?""
""Sure,"" she said.  ""By the way, I'm Jackie.""
Staring at me as I hailed down the taxi
We jumped in. The cab slowly moved off
She was holding my hand and it felt so soft
Now on my ear she gently chewed
And I knew it was more than just gratitude
I took it upon myself to take her to my house
I guess she didn't mind because her clothes were doused
Paid the cab his fee
Took out my house keys
Opened up the door, said ""Enter please""
Took her to the bathroom, said ""Hang your clothes on the line""
And gave her one of my shirts from Calvin Klein
Went to my room took off my wet wardrobe
I freshened up a bit and put on my silk robe
We met in the front near the roaring flames
Where we sat quietly sipping on champagne
Her eyes said ""Thanks"" beyond the use of words
And the crackling flame was all I heard
It felt as though we were on our honeymoon
As we moved from the front into the bedroom
We made passion love the night we met
And by the time we fell asleep there were no regrets
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I woke up the next morning.  She was not there
Maybe she's fixing breakfast or doing her hair
I got out of my bed, threw on me house coat
When I noticed on the mirror she'd left a note
Saying, ""Sorry Dane, I could not stay
Please meet me 1 o'clock where we met yesterday.""
Well, I had time.  Two hours and a half
So I laid out my clothes and took a bath
I ate a good breakfast, had time to spare
So then I got dressed and I dally over there
I reached my destination not a cloud in sight
It was cool, kinda windy, but the sun was bright
Now I was on time, but she didn't show
And that was about twenty minutes ago
I stayed a little longer, about a half an hour
Felt a raindrop, maybe it's a sun shower
I was soon to see that my thoughts were wrong
Because the raindrop became an all-out storm
And there I was standing in the rain
And the lady that I looked for never came
Well, I was hurt and it showed in my face
As I tracked in the rain backed to my place
Slowly I walked hoping to bump into her
Me be in love? Nah, I barely knew her
I got home angry and depressed
And my Bally shoes were a total mess
But that was the last thing on my mind
As I sat on the couch staring into time
Well, I had her number and she had mine
But if she really wanted me she would have dropped me a line
But day after day and weeks went by
But she didn't call even to say, ""Hi""
I would have called her first, but I've got my pride
""And I really don't care"", to myself I lied
Now, there was no reason for me to be sad
Just remember that good time that we had
'Cause I learned a little something that you should know
To keep some things you got to let them go
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight

168,Why Don't We Fall In Love,"[Verse 1]
So many things I'm going through
So much that I wanna do
It starting to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly, you and I
We fall in love, so many reasons why

(It's so many reasons
It's the only thing that matters to me)

[Verse 2]
Why don't we fall in love
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one I never want to go
Think I never did know what to do
A love I never felt, now I feel for you
Why don't I just swallow each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend

[Chorus]
Why don't we, don't we (why can't we)
Why don't we (why can't we), why don't we (why can't we)

Fly Mary in to sing to that cow before we slaughtered it
And then I ordered it

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Don't say a word to me
You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better, you better save that

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Laid by the pool, my legs gettin' massaged by a professional
Strictly business, nothin' sexual
Seasonal vegetables lookin' exceptional
You ain't think I was hot then, now you wanna hum on my testicles
I'm from a dirty borough where that Sun don't come out
But when the moon come and the goons come, the crew runs
Like a big Jamaican, I stand adjacent
To that S600 in amazement
My time gon' come, I'm headed to the top
Like I never wore makeup, and I'm ready for the spotlight
You know I got my hoodie on, and it's such a hot night
Shit I'm straight from Queens, catch me in the limo like it's prom night

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Don't say a word to me
You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better, you better save that

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
This that do a hundred in the rental in the rain
With the jammy, a day before I have to go to Spain
Livin' on the edge, different colored women in my bed
Different, different colored linens on my leg
My mother said I better win or else she'll fuck me up
Ma we did it, I love you, you lucky slut
Since I was young I had the husky gut
But I'm gorgeous, got money in the pouch just like a tourist
Swerve in a Skylark, big piece of the pie chart
Bitch this is fine art, I gets my shine on
You lyin', dog, you never even put the iron on
You drive a Scion, you ain't ridin', dog
Me, I'm cell built, grab your chest
Still get hit with right hands from left field
My life is a kaleidoscope
She makes me feel just like I'm high on dope
I never calm down, shoot the gun without puttin' my son down

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Don't say a word to me
You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better, you better save that

[Outro: Big Body Bes]
You should have been known who the fuck this was
Just by my fuckin' tongue
Big fuckin' Body Bes
You know I'm all over everything now
You know me, you might see my face stamped on a bag of dope
Out here gettin' filthy cause you know I got that ooh woo woo. You know me, I go home and change up
I get fresh to fight. Just caught a new fuckin' case. But it's alright though, I got this stupid mothafuckin' lawyer
He told me, ""Don't even worry about that shit, Body. I'll make that go away
Now what's for lunch?"" I told him, don't worry, I got the hookup
Anything you want. Crown Fried on me, 1 through 6 only
I know your type though
The type of mothafucka wear a three piece suit to go to court, shook to death
And you there for smokin' weed

Like Ginger from ""Casino"" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right

I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away

I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)

Say you got control over me

Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it

I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)

Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be okay (I need to be okay)

Be living without you (Living without you, shit 'cause life is crazy)

Yo, nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin (Oh, no)
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright (Be alright, yes)
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right? (Oh, no)
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat (Said I'm gonna be alright)

[Thoughtz]

Rocking like a seizure patient pleasing faces
Resuppose our life in sequence been through recent stages
To redefine ourselves leaves us ageless
We're predisposed to greed
Our graces lead us places where we bleed
We need to read the basics
Cuz I don't see the basis
Of half these legislative lies that lead us lazy league of haters
See the latest in the news near you
It's a two tier rule
Bottom or top, weak or strong
Pick a side, you don't get choose
Be silent n rot and hope the violence could stop
All the while a tyrant atop a throne smiling
The games violent insane
Where cats would die for a name
Off the chain constant the flame
Cooking these rappers I chomp on they frame
I feed off wackness, snack on their beings
Leave a path of these weaklings while I laugh undefeated
They Throwing up white flags and offering contractual agreements
In hopes I won't be back for a beating
Get taxed for the evening like snatch
Never say we're practically even
Or get tactically beat after the match hand you ya hat
Which is what I was catching ya teeth in
I thought you'd naturally keep 'em
I'm actually speaking flames like dragons are breathing ya frame
Get charred n tattered for treason
Sometimes with no actual reason

I hate to say I told you so
We break the mold and stole the show
Put a hole in a snake's face
Illuminate space with a solar glow
Flow with an innate grace
My pace chased by light speed
Exceeding degrees of might to all new heights when my flight leave
Incite leagues of lunacy
Imbued with doom's impunity
Inhumanly stay consumed in rubber-rooms after a shrooming spree
Free from my cocoon I hewn monoliths of my dominance
With the prominence of God compare my squad with how a comet hits
An onimous barrage you couldn't dodge the jihad genocide
Gentrified genders with senseless pretenders making an attempt to hide
And menticide contenders til they remember only the words I say
Til the way that they react will have my back like 33 vertebrae
A murdering slay with flawlessness, lawlessness leaking off of this
I'm Morpheus anamorphic warping the thoughts of what the portrait is
Of course the most awesomest force of the mind mending contortionist
I'll finish lines like Boston, while you finish lines like the abortion did
I'm coursing with endorphines throughout your corpus callosum
I stay roasting your pineal gland until you fall to convulsions
Ain't no hope for your feeble plan
Your weasel fam gets their cerebrals jammed
Looking like Sméagol shooting needles in their adrenal gland

I’m standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip and it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I’ma be here 'til it’s done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit

It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby, you on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mhm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt, you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip - yeaaaalm!

Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin', ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me

Funny how now is the time I decide I wanna be honest
Our potential is ahead, the regret is so far behind us
And all the BS that I was so good at giving you, was almost criminal, now you sending subliminals
All your friends are defending you, pow wowing against me up in my living room
Running after birds, what a lame choice, maybe I deserve in my Tank voice
Cause all them lames you was curving, I'm observing, you giving time to them same boys

And every nigga is quick to say I'm gully out the heat
I ain't worried muthafucka
I got my feet up gettin' ready for the summer
I could bet a million that you're boy about to come up
Don't be mad at the world cause your records ain't buzzin'
Don't be mad at the system cause you niggas ain't stuntin'
Don't be mad at your boy cause you ain't worth nothing
Cause you ain't worth nothing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
This song got a muthafuckin' feeling like Pac though
(Feelin' like Pac, thug life) picture me rollin'
Duck the police in a pothole (skrrr, Five-O)
Wh-whipping this shit stolen
Passenger seat is El Gato (When that's pussy I beat it)
Beat it till it's swollen
Then I paint her face like Picasso (Nah bitch)
Pronto, you ain't e'n known it, like Rocko
Welcome to the Midwest
Fill the fridge up with them government checks
Dark liquor is a must when you one of us
And we got the Bub for the bus, go and ingest
Funny that my father wanted me to be a scholar
Instead I grew up like him and became an alcoholic
A couple of dollars, get some gin and tonic, and a couple condoms
Give a bitch head trauma, not she hooked on phonics
Ye ain't never seen a muthafucka (2x)
Cleveland boy get up on the big screen
With the same team that he used to ride the bus with
Now they got a tour bus, shit
Ye ain't never seen a muthafucka (2x)
Go from flippin' burgers at the Fuddruckers
Hit up private jets with the Jimmy Iovines
Then flying Coach, back to the drug runners
100

[Chorus: Billard]

[Verse 3: Billard]
I might sell my soul for a new Bugatti
Shit, I'm just young and reckless
I see why half of you rappers stressin'
I'm here now nigga, you can get to steppin'
All these hoes nowadays seem to act so desperate
I give her what she want, then I'm on to the next chick
She don't say nothing cause she know I'm the next ""it""
Your times up girl, that's it, girl hit the exit
You should be faithful that you in my presence
""Oh, you needing Jesus"" I don't need your blessings
Like learn your lessons, don't with king
I mean like, we know who jealous, so fuck with me
This that give-and-go, that pick-and-roll
This that cock back and let it go
This that bang, bang, that bang fo'sho'
My niggas bang fo'sho', this ain't for show",Billard,2002,"[92, 82, 82, 79, 72, 69, 70]",7

Ask the Lord to forgive me for the sins I commit
My mom prayed I got her that Benz with the tint
My father prayed I gave him 5 stacks for his trouble
First class flights to Aruba for the couple
Yea they raised me to be everything that I could be
Lost a milli got right back up from it like a G
Ain't no one in my stratosphere far as I could see
Me and my girl be arguing homie - Ike and T
What's love got to do with anything
When the moment u away u be hiding your wedding ring huh?
How that pain feel?
When she find out everything u told her ain't real
Take it from me
I got these lies on my head
These wives on my bed
They lying too they just don't realize what they said
Just broke the heart of their man
Broke the heart of their lover

She fell to her knees 
Say the Lords prayer
Sometimes we test the water to see if the Lord's there
They shooting up the schools we wonder if the Lord cares
Divine intervention wonder if the Lord dares
Interrupt the perfect balance of good and evil the challenge
To hear the cries of those behind closed doors in silence
Enraged by the violence
Still I turn around and drive that Ghost down Collins
And I ain't looking back
Am I really that callous?
Ambitions of a king
With visions of a queen spending digits on a ring
My ring finger and middle finger is so close
You can love and hate the ones you really owe the most
A thin line when its good you still could overdose
Take too much to the head and you end up comatose

Forgive me for all the sins I commit under the

Me and that ol' back road keep swervin' around these tall pines
Find a spot, pop a top, and take a sip of that apple pie
I just love the slow pace of livin' down south
Hope I die of old age and buried right here at the house
Buddy my bloodline my last name ain’t shit changed about me
With that shotgun ain’t got to aim keep drankin' 'til I can’t see
Livin' way back in the sticks, nah I’m good right where I'm at
Y'all city folk keep rolling on, hey y'all ain’t got to come back
Yeah I’m country as a blue tick, boy I thought I told y'all
Ain’t ridin' with no new chick, I’m rollin' with my road dog
Way on past the railroad tracks, there’s a road up in the back
It winds around away from town, then dwindles down to a two path
Ridin' around them flat woods, sippin' on that act good
We jack 'em up and jack em out, ride 'em out like a Lac should

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To want you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

Squares don't understando
Play like a piano when I'm flipping through the
Channel, man don't make me lose convultions, chokin'
On some doja, cars keep flippin' over
Getting' Jags and Testerosas
Motorola, Coca-Cola, stay high and never sober
Got them hot girls makin' love to my poster
Attitude kinda flippy, pockets never skimpy
Married to Marijuana with that drama you can miss me
Fifty-fifty I'm a playa, slash money maker by nature
I get that paper pushin' green and snowyflaka
Make a good girl turn to sinna
Puttin' inches all up in her
Blaze the bitch up now she's a bread winner

I used to get spankings from my momma
But uh now this lil' ass baby smokin' on dank in The
Bahamas, got a pair of Versace pajamas

I come through with the blue Coug
And shit I'm thinkin' Lexus Limo
I'm a swang three lanes to the piece and chain
And the pinky ring I'm gonna blind
Cuz it's my time, I pack my dime, I put two holes
Right in your spine
Every time you talkin' down my rhyme
Boy I beat yo lil' behind
And stop and rewind, feel my lines
Bottle like me, I'm gonna shine
Little Christian on a mission
But listen he gaining recognition
In the Expedition, it's gonna glistin'
Got a line and he went fishin'
Pay attention to the Louisiano recano regano with a
Blano, I be puffin' on a big Fano
Got mo' green than the motherfucking lotto
Nigga I'm the one, the Christian
The lucky motherfucker outside of the Yukon
I'm swangin' fo's, I'm slangin' hoes
Representing of the way Houston

And I'm counting green
Cuz boy I'm all about my feria (feria)

Gold medal around my necka, living la vida chueca

Momma mad, cuz I just just failed my piss test
Brain deader than a door knob
This is, for my road dog
Fresh out the Pen I take him out to get a blowjob
I'm so shy, controlling the streets, like a robot
The one to put a dope house
I'm sorry but it won't stop
My door got kicked in once before
And I'm sho' they won't try that stupid shit no more

And I'll always be, your cover when your cold
And when the world winds up against you, im the safe place you can go

Now the whole worlds in bed sleepin, I think were finally alone
And if the telephone starts ringin, we'll pretend like were not home
Cause any fool would understand

Messing with my reputation

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
You fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh baby), say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine

Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh baby), say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Bridge]
You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine

201,All You Wanted,"[Verse 1]
I wanted to be like you
I wanted everything
So I tried to be like you
And I got swept away
I didn't know that it was so cold
And you needed someone to show you the way
So I took your hand and we figured out that
When the tide comes, I'd take you away

[Chorus]
If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on
Please, can you tell me?
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone

Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit

Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic

Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream

He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin

He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood

Had a man on the side
And she never spent time with you
What if a woman
Said she's working late
And it's always the same excuse
What if a woman
Took the keys to your whip
Said I'll be right back, don't trip
What if a woman
Left you home with the kids
Changing diapers and shit
What a twist

Could you stand inside her shoes and walk a mile?
(I don't really think so)
Could you hold her down when she doesn't smile?
(I don't know a man who could)

What if a woman was just like you?

What if a woman
Could you ever wonder if she does?

[Verse 2]
What if a woman
Started wearing the pants
Would you feel less of a man and more
What if a woman
Never wanna settle down
Always wanna run around on the low
You can beg, you can plead, you can cry
She won't be your wife
But your eyes are full of tears
She'll be running the streets
With girls hanging out tonight
It's the same thing you do to her

Steppin' outside through the backdoor
I remember scoopin’ you in the black ford
Now you’re worldwide got stamps on the passport
You the whole reason that I rap more
Got me goin’ crazy in the booth babe
Ridin’ solo in the city
All the bad things that I done tryin’ to forget about your name
Man I pray the lord forgive me

Rich guys bet you know plenty
But women like you and guys like me
Besides the two of us I don’t think I  know any

And I know I said some fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Know I put it all in your face

And you always gonna get what you ask for
In and out of the terminal tryin’ to find ya
Maybe you just needed a reminder
Yeah I know you love sex but doggy style ain’t the only time you gonna need someone behind ya
Yeah girl and you be
You be playin’ my emotions
Tell me not to call you or  text you or tweet you
The next day the call lines open (what the fuck)
I made a plan put it into motion
You made a plan for crossing over oceans
I was sour about it like the shit I’m smokin’
But I had to let you go to show you my devotion

I need a girl in my life
Who's beautiful enough to all my soul
Need someone I can hold
I need a girl in my life
I decided that is something you should know
That I'll never let you go
I need a girl

[Strophe I: Kay One]
Eine Frau die mich liebt, selbst wenn ich nichts mehr hab'
Aber hast du was bist du was
Die meisten Frauen sind auf Geld aus
Handtasche LV
Schatz, ich hätt' gern das Kleid von Cavalli, ooh
Und dazu noch diesen Bally Schuh
Genug, ich brauch' keine Famebitch
Fake Chicks mit Botox und Facelift
Ich brauch ein Mädchen mit Hoodie und Chucks, yes
Die, die Anrufe in der Nacht schätzt
Die immer für mich da ist
Bei der selbst meine Mum sagt: ""Sympathisch - die mag ich""
Eine Frau, die mich niemals enttäuscht
Und keine Diva, die träumt, doch ich geb' nicht auf
Sag's mir, wo find ich dich, ha?
Mario sing's für mich

[Hook]

[Strophe II: Kay One]
Und kein Papagei, der mich nachplappert
Sie will kein Schampus, sie hätt' gern ein Glas Wasser
Denn sie braucht das nicht: sich profilieren
Kein Shake-Hands, haute couture
Sie macht sich nicht für die Disco schick
Sie macht sich hübsch für mich
Ein Flittchen ist nicht interessant für mich
Sie kommen so schnell an wenn der Anzug sitzt
Arrogante Chicks die auf High Class tun
Fühlen sich mit nem scheiß Sekt cool
One-Night-Stands, ich will keinen drauf machen
Ich will jeden Tag neben ihr aufwachen
Lachen, und wir leihen uns ein Film
Einfach Freitags mal chill'n
Handy auf Lautlos ich bin mit meinem Baby
Mario, sing's für die Ladies

A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

[Chorus]
There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

[Verse 2]
Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

Waiting in the driveway
Shining like a bright new star
I've been wishing on it every day
To take me away from here

So I called in to where I work
Told a little white lie
No, my back don't really hurt
But that's my alibi
My temporary ticket to anywhere but there

Call it going off the deep end
Call it what you want

Be who I wanna be

Call it going off the deep end

Eyes darker than coal

Into my soul

Mi Corzon perdido en ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
Oh my heart is lost to you

Maybe it was the music
The way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment
That hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing
Mesmerized by the gaze
There was some kind of magic
That led me away

The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes the only pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo Moc, Socks and Rugby's
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Maxmil, blast Pierre
That was Build Build, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake, Starks is back
Niggas want work, 9 brought back off a g-pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese line
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Rainy days) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dough flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit

Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats, cats, and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-build
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?

It's raining, he's changing

Then out of the blue, it all comes tumblin' down

Who's gonna hold me tonight

'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me

And my picture, in your locket
What will you do with it now
All our friends, and all our memories
Tell me how we sort them out

You don't love me anymore

229,Drive (For Daddy Gene),"[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

[Chorus]
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

You're a song
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

[Verse 2]
'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

There's my territory
And all the things I deserve

[Bridge]
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true
Oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory

I never knew there were such great movies
On tv at 3 am
I'd never guessed that at midnight tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl
But these days i'm all turned around
There's only one thing i'm sure of right now

[Chorus:]
I should be sleeping
'stead of keeping
These late hours i've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though i'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still i know i
Should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

[Verse 2:]
I never knew that i was funny
'til i went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and i liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like i'll be up for a while

And one great kiss

Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep

Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

Try to find a way to talk about it
I’m also in the mind to just let it go
How to reach out my mind if I can’t think straight
With the goodness so gone I feel to isolate
You called me baby, I called you one too
Until you spoke to me with another voice
You sent in spiders to fight for you
I was so disappointed I didn’t know what to do

I wish I didn’t miss you
I wish I didn’t miss you
I wish I didn’t miss you
I wish I didn’t miss you

Wasting so many hours away
So many ways to waste a day
In this same city I hope you’re not
'Cause the town has shrunk to the size of my thoughts
It was so mystifying to see you so changed
I felt some certainty you must have died
Because how could I live if you’re still alive?

A new day has come
A new day has come

[Verse 1]
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

Oh, it's almost blinding me

Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (Drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

Oh, it's almost blinding me

Out of the depth of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray-Bans
I'm stunning man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man

What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hanging without bringing you the fun again?
Tangling with the alien scum again
Monumental it's the black suits running in

The best looking crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right and play nice and sing along

One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right there
Thank you mission completed

You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember

When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you

243,One Mic,"[Produced by Chucky Thompson and Nas]

[Intro]
One time, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)",Nas,2002,"[99, 98, 87, 79, 57, 45, 44, 43, 47, 58, 63, 70, 79]",13
244,I Don't Want You To Go,"Here I am
Alone and I don't understand
Exactly how it all began
The dream just walked away
I'm holding on
When all but the passion's gone
And from the start
Maybe I was tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' my heart
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
And heroes die
When they ignore the cause inside
But they learn from what's left behind
And fight for something else
And so it goes
That we have both learned how to grow
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our heart
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go

[Bridge]
Oh it's just too much
Takin' all the whole world all by myself
But it's not enough
Unless I stop trusting somebody else
Somebody else
And love again

And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go, no

Strange for me to wanna love someone

Cause I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
'Cause baby, I've been falling for you
But falling back up out your way

Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything

Admiring you from a distance
Scared to go and make a move
Didn't wanna be distracting

247,What If She's An Angel,"There's a man standing on the corner
With a sign saying, 'Will work for food'
You know the man, you see him every morning
The one you never give your money to

You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean

What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if he's an angel?

There's a man and there's a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
There's a lot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony

You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
But come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye?

What if she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
But what if she's an angel?

A little girl on daddy's lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel, most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes?

Maybe she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another

When I hear you softly say my name
When you're high and when you're low
When you don't need me to explain
'Cause you already know
When you smile that way

When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do

When you're drivin' in your car
When you dance and sing to the radio
When you're walkin' underneath the stars
Anywhere and everywhere you go
When you're dressed up or you're dressed down
When you're talkin' on the phone
With a million people all around
Or when you're all alone
When you're near, or you're far
You're in my heart no matter where you are

Show me what it's for, make me understand it

Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

Help me carry on, assure me it's OK to
Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness
Will the ending be ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?

Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

So when and how will I know?

Talk to me man…
This ya boy Young Hova, yo, turn the muh'fuckin' noise up
We can get right into the proceedings this evening
Headphones are distortin', bring it down a lil' bit
Okay, now we workin' with it
The boy Face up in Baseline (Face Mob!)
Welcome to New York City
It's ya boy Young Hov' (chyea!)
Kanye West on the track (woo!)
Chi-Town, what’s goin' on now?
Can I talk to y'all for a minute?
Lemme talk to y'all for a minute
(Just gimme a minute of ya time baby, I don't want much)
Lemme talk to these muh'fuckas, uhh

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Guess who's bizack? You still smellin' crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxin' them road; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do nuttin' with it, straight from the oven with it
Came from the dirt, I emerged from it all
Without a stain on my shirt; you can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm callin' guts every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off
Face it, y'all, y'all niggas playin' basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall
Homie, I'm in the drop with the AC off
That's why the streets embrace me dawg, I'm so cool

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's bizack? Back on the block with them O's
Face Mob, Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
'Cause this street shit is all I know

[Verse 2: Scarface]
From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot, a jar and a spoon
Tryin' to make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rock stars and goons
Plain clothes wanna run in my room (woooo!)
But nigga guess who's bizack? It's ya boy Face Mob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake dawg
Give niggas a break, nah; you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? No
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the 88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue and that's on the fo' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make fo' sho' I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war and you ain't makin' a dime (haha!)
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here payin' his dues
My baby walkin', gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewin', lemme give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues
It's a new game goin', lemme give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, whoa (haha!)

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Guess who's bizack? The boy B. Mizack, AKA Mr. Crack-A-Brick
Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gas get clipped
You can make ya chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like old box-spring
Pissy mattress shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like quarter water
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Til' like deuce in the morning, with the old heads (uh!)
Slangin' loose quarters, this Philly cat back at it
Still fuckin' with 'em crack addicts, still bustin' with that black-matic

251,Ain't It Funny,"[Verse 1]
Verbal couture
Parkour
With the metaphors
The flow house of horror
Dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch
Six sense
With a nose drip
Mind skydive
Sniffing bumps
In the cockpit
Locksmith of Hip Hop
Appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size
As the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic
Prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends
Cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke
Just to sniff need a ski lift
Flip your table over
If you cut it with the bullshit
Nose bleeds red carpets
But it just blend in
Snapping pictures
Feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life
Seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left
So I try to seize the moment

[Pre-Hook]
Funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
That joke's on you

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time
Make trees
Take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket
Savage with bad habits
Broke serving fiends
Got rich became a addict
Ain’t it funny how it happens
Who would ever would imagine
Nose running right now
Could ya pass me a napkin
Managed to somehow
To have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone
And nobody is answering
Ain’t it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
No way to mask it
A lot became has beens
Rolling up that 100 dollar bill
Till they cash in
Thinks it gone last
Going too fast
Man it's fucked up
Ain't it funny how it happens

Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down
Cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can’t stop laughing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can't stop laughing
It’s a living nightmare
That most of us might share
Inherited in our blood
It's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use
Or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to
Tell you what I’m gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems
With this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me
So popping them Xannies
Might need rehab
But to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y’all
Cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8 ball of coke
And my nigga on the way
Got 3 hoes with him
And they all tryna play

Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance
From his body, so buttery brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook, I had to catch my breath

[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Verse 2: Tweet]
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride
Let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left; reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

Somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell 'em what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doing now
And in case you're wondering too

I breathe in, I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Now I've got every reason
To find someone new
Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turnin' round
And my heart believes that you're gone

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Til you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Yes we were meant to be
Girl there's no doubt
And if it takes the rest of my life
For you to figure it out

If it weren't for your maturity, none of this would have happened

If it weren't for my attention, you wouldn't have been successful and if
If it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much

But you don't seem to mind, and
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

Well, fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Verse 2]
You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're a kind of my protégé and one day you'll say you learned all you know from me
I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would, and I think I like ya

But, ooh, you don't seem to mind
Dude, don't go telling everybody

What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

[Verse 3]
Just make sure you don't tell on me, especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly

263,Youth Of The Nation,"Last day of the rest of my life, I wish I would have known
Cause I'd have kissed my momma goodbye
I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I cared
Or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
Unaware I just did what I always do
Everyday the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of takin' the test I took two to the chest
Call me blind but I didn't see it comin'
And everybody was runnin' but I couldn't hear nothin'
Except gun blast, it happened so fast, I didn't really know
This kid though I sat by him in class
Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love or
Maybe for a moment he forgot who he was or
Maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was I know it's because
We are, we are the youth of the nation
We are, we are youth of the nation
We are, we are the youth of the nation
We are, we are youth of the nation
Little Suzie, she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kinda proud but no respect for herself
She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations, just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her she deserved much better
Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules so you would think he was cool
He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried often thought of suicide
It's kinda hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end, they might remember him then
You cross a line and there is no turnin' back
He told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat
We are, we are the youth of the nation
We are, we are youth of the nation
We are, we are the youth of the nation
We are, we are youth of the nation
Who's to blame for the life that tragedies claim?
No matter what you say it won't take away the pain
That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why it's the blind leadin' the blind
Guess that's the way that the story goes
Will it ever make sense somebody's gotta know
There's gotta be more to life than this
There's got to be more to everything I thought exists

We are, we are youth of the nation
We are, we are the youth of the nation

I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
For once, I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame
Trapped in the past for too long

Each one is different, but they're always the same
They mean me no harm, but it's time that I face it
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong

I'm movin' on

[Verse 3]
I'm movin' on
At last I can see (At last I can see)
Life has been patiently Waiting for me
And I know
There's no guarantees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by (All the years passing by)
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

[Verse 4]
I sold what I could
And packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road

And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway

We met at a truckstop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm
Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'

She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun

And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

Woo...

Well we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a sheriff right beside me
Pistol pointed at my side

Open up a beer and you say, ""Get over here""

Take that body downtown
I say, ""You da bestest,"" lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on

Your kisses make my skin feel weak
Always suffering in your heat

Chocolate covered lover, you've never been so sweet before
Open our bodies, I quietly knock on your door
I-I-I just wanna sweet talk for awhile
Whisper all the things I absolutely adore
About your smile, it's like I'm in a candy store
Oh-h-h, I love your sugar coating words

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's the way the honey drips off of your lips
Maybe it's the taste of your caramel apple kiss

[Chorus]
And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high
High, oh, high
High, oh, high

[Verse 2]
Your cotton candy voice melts in my mouth as you speak
Beautiful boy, your words are made of poetry
I-I-I could listen to you all day

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's the way you laffy taffy love
Maybe it's the way you run your hands up my back

[Chorus]
And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high
High, oh, high
High, oh, high

[Bridge]
Maybe it's the way you lay me down at night
Or how you turn November into hot summer July

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me

[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like ""It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight""
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
""Fuck police"" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

275,The Cowboy In Me,"[Verse 1]
I do not know why I act the way I do
Like I am not got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I am my own worst enemy
I guess that is just the cowboy in me

I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fighting mad
At where this road I am heading down might lead
I guess that is just the cowboy in me

[Chorus]
The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that is never satisfied
The face that is in the mirror when I do not like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

[Verse 2]
Girl I know there is times you must have thought
There am not a line you have drawn I have not crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that is just the cowboy in you

276,That's Just Jessie,"Sometimes in the morning
My coffee gets ice cold
And I'll burn up three cigarettes
Before I have my first smoke
Miss my exit on the way to work
Every now and then
I always blame it on the traffic when they ask me where I've been

And in a crowded elevator
I'll start hummin' that ol' song
There's no way of knowin' when that urge will come along
I've been stuck in some meeting
Looked down at my legal pad
I'd see hearts and flowers and butterflies
And I can't help but laugh

That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those ""kiss me"" green eyes smilin' back at me

That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie

An sometimes in the evening
I hear barefeet in the hall
And I see a slender silhouette dance across the wall
Then I catch the sent of jasmine perfume in the wind
And I know it's her sweet memory coming back again

That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And thos ""kiss me"" green eyes smilin' back at me

That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy

But that's just Jessie
In a white cotton dress
That's just a wildfire that I ain't put out yet
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those ""kiss me"" green eyes smilin' back at me

From the CO to across the seas
I'm guaranteed to make everybody bounce wit me
I been known to rip it down anyplace I be
You can copy but it's only gon' be one me
I don't ride no cars, if the man come, remember 14
I done started up a whole epidemic
Look, y'all know what I'm talkin' about
Ever since I hooked up with the homey down south
TV shows, magazine covers
Girls in groups say we go wit each other
Sold out shows, pocket full of cake
What you know about sellin' tres mil out the gate?
See, I'm the hottest (hottest) thing around
Neck full of bling bling like the Neptunes' sound
I got it locked from the left, right, front, and rear
When I step up in the spot this is all I hear

[Hook - Girl]
Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take you home

The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time

Represent that - (So So Def)

[Verse 2]
Right now when I'm old, where I'm gonna be
Have a flow, homey you can bet the house on me
I'mma forever be up under the scope
I ain't tryna go out like Todd Bridges of ""Different Strokes""
I was born to rock, born to rhyme
What you lookin' at is something that's before they time
Like the number 23 in the red and black
Mr. 106 and Park is back, Holla
I do it like no other
And attract more family than 'Ringling Brothers'
I got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like, hash browns
See, I'm the best just ask around
Yo, I'm here now and ain't nobody takin' mine
It's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can
You better off gettin a shirt
Makin a sign that reads, ""SHAD MOSS, I'm your #1 fan""

It was about five until five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said you and you come with me
Cause you're going to have to stay
My heart was thumping I was jumping
I had to get away

[Chorus]
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

[Verse 2]
Well I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
He asked the loaded question
It seems unreal to me that
He said how do you feel about me
My mind was racing I was pacing
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it coming on

[Chorus]
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
Because when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little to tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

Of course I do my two-step, I give 'em too much

I had enough they throwin' bows, see they swingin and shit
I got my arm around this smut dame, puttin' in work
Before we merk I got to book somethin'
So baby stop frontin'

Ain't got to buy nothin'

But I know I pimp nasty

Can't help but the boogie
Get loose but don't push me

And we're all wearin' hoodies

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together

Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time

Its all about you boo

I can picture us runnin in the rain
After a movie then we spark a flame
Oh I love it when you scream my name
Going 60 in the 3rd lane
We pull over to the parkin lot
In the Park that's my favorite spot
Doing just about anything
We'll be goin til the birds sing

[Chorus]
I think its bout time that I make you mine
Oh what your saying to me boy come on break it down
To find another like you will be a lifetime
I think I see where you're going baby let it out let it out
Listen to me baby got something to say

Forever is what I wanna give to you so what do you say

Chasin' my tour bus tryna find out where Insane went
Asian bitches let the nigga fuck and I think her name was Raylynn
They friends comin' to the Days Inn
And they all wanna get brained in
They kin with you nigga steady at the crib
Watchin' kids in the playpen
Blazin' while the bitch suckin' all up on my dick
And I'ma fuck her face then
Send her back to you with her legs bent
She'll be leavin' nigga by day ten
Amen, gettin' sick of fake friends
Leave a nigga bloody, need an apron
Put 'em on a plate then eat a mutherfucker
I don't even say my grace then
Cake and niggas stay broke
While I'm on the road, countin' out my cake then
With a hoe that'll give me throat
You already know that a nigga blazin'
On the dro, then I gotta go, bitch I'm on the road
I'ma keep you waitin'
I don't know, but I'm really zoned
I don't even know what the fuck a date is
I got a chrome, and I gotta zone
And I'm in a zone and I'm hella faded
Gotta hoe, that'll give me dome
Nothin' with a comb, finna get me braided
Gracious goodness, got a rich bitch and babies hoodrich

Every single bitch I ever gave a dick and probably can't nobody top it, probably is the reason when a nigga skiddin' I be tryna cut it like hydroxy
Too cocky

286,So Complicated,"[Verse 1: Eligh]

I refused to get a job, so I got the boot
With a brown back pack on the town, everything that i owned
In a box or two in the back of my cousins Honda
Hit the 5 to get up to the bay
17 with no clutch
No brakes no damn ideas on what it would take to make music to live
Not much debate, that's what it would be, no plan b
No can see no other path, no other math added up
Anyone disagree, missing me subtract that energy
Easily I approach, microphones like I needed one in hand to look natural
Scared little man didn't know what to do
When he got on the stage, he was hiding from you
How could that be? One asked
One outcast couldn't look his best friends in the eye
Wanna die when nervousness enters the brain like parasites
Paralyzed by bright lights, loud eyes, and licence to kill self with night vices
The nice guys finish first sometimes
When a man puts in work on his timeline
When a man rides the surf in his mind
Through catching waves of consciousness divine through rhyme
Over melody's
Piano takes me back to a simple me

[Hook: Eligh]

So complicated, so complicated, so complicated..

[Verse 2: The Grouch]

Now 87 is one of my tempos
You could throw me a curve though
I ain't no simp bro
Been riding the beat since my talent was local
Bay bred buddy 'til I switched it to SoCal
Big Grizzly from the peak to the paws
Used to do that to the tape and wouldn't get no applause
Now every once in a while
Folks from my past put it together and they shit in they draws
Not literally though, figuratively
No Mr. forgive me no more, never know door mat
Wipe your feet on your own back
Ain't into the burnin' bridges, I could never condone that
Till I collapse, I'm still ill and dealin' dap's
Feeling myself, self, you feeling that?
But of course, I love your voice, your word choice is choice
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
No, but got a German get up and go
So tell me when ta hip ya
You already know
This deep in the scripted sleek
Well dipped, rhythmic, poetic deliverance of speech
With a universal reach
We keep it versatile, to each it's personal
Held close to the blood pump till nurses come
Which song you going to play when the hearses bump?

You can't tie a sweater over that ass, or hide it in pajamas
We lay back, blowin' ganja
DVD, she make it hard to watch a flat TV - WHOA!
I crept up behind her
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like Rice
I call mami Montana, bandana
Tied her hands up - this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of Army, got mami in the mood
Then she stripped for me like the ""Moulin Rouge""
I think I might wife her
Y'know, powder blue Rocawear suit, white Nike her
Add mami to the cypher
R-O-C for life cuz, the gang, motherfucker

I make ya hotter than the next bitch - no need
For you to ever sweat the next bitch - with speed
I make the next bitch see the exit - indeed
Gotta know you're thoroughly respected - by me
You get the keys to the Lexus - but no drive
You get your own 2002, she through ridin'
Keep yo' ass tight up in Versace
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends
You gotta watch me, they connivin' shit
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi
But everybody ain't as horny as me
And your body's - callin', me...

Uhh, yeah
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rear view mirror
Oh, her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Louboutin's with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

291,Welcome To Atlanta,"[Intro: Jermaine Dupri + Ludacris]
After the party it's the Waffle House
If you ever been here, you know what I'm talkin about
Where people don't dance, all they do is this
And after the original you know what it is
Welcome to Atlanta

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
Remix, it had to go down
I got somethin' else to tell you 'bout the new Motown
Where people don't visit, they move out here
And ain't no tellin' who you might see up in Lenox Square
I don't know about you but I miss the Freaknik
'Cause that's where my city use to be real sick
People from other cities used to drive for miles
Just to come to get a taste of this ATL style
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballinest Player
Make my own moves, call me the mayor
Monday night, you know things change with time
Magic City back lookin' like '89
All the homies on the Southside up in the Ritz
Tuesday night, the Velvet Room, same shit
Wednesday, Strokers, I don't go no mo'
'Cause they don't know how to treat you when you come through the do'
Thursday night, was Plush but we moved to Fuel
And I be up in the booth drunk, actin' a fool
Friday night, at Kaya, they still got love
And the Sharkbar be poppin' like it's a nightclub
Saturday, still off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in One Tweezy
Sunday, gettin' me some sleep, please
I'm on my way to the Dec' to hit Jazzy Tee's, holla

[Interlude: P. Diddy]
Ayo, I'm from New York, man!
Representin' NYC to the fullest
Gats, I pull it, heads be duckin' when New York be bussin'
Take that

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
Welcome To New York, motherfuckers, where we don't play
And out-of-towners get got like everyday
And a gangsta's a gangsta in every way
Sittin' low on 22's; this what long money do
Now the don's on it, Diddy shine on it
Tell Flex to run it back and drop a bomb on it
Sunday, we layin' low at Halo, sippin' Cris and we straight
Monday, we go to Bungalow 8
Tuesday, I'm in Spa, drunk, doin' the shake
And for the rest of the week, we just follow the freaks
You can spot us out of town by the way that we walk
The way that we talk, cocky, the state of New York
Hot now top down at the Rucker game
New coupe, no roof, playa, what's my name?
Now Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten
Uptown, what now?! Let's make it happen

[Interlude 2: P. Diddy]
New York, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
We still here! And we buildin' four more new towers!

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Who say St. Louis ain't hip hop? Dirty, we hop to what's hip
I'm a lunatic with too much grip to let us slip
I'm so St. Louis, ask my tattooist
I was like ""The Waterboy,"" now they sayin, ""YOU CAN DO IT!""
I'm Baby Huey, one of the best in the Louie
Sip Louis, smoke louie, dressed in Louis
Home of back porches, Chucks, and Air Forces
Old school cars be trailblazin' like Portland
The girls are the best like Travis with fat asses
I call 'em gimme girls, they always tell me I can have it
All got habits, marijuana to static
By two cats and coats with automatics
St. Louis, the Truth like Sojourner
Don't need a burner we learn from Ike Turner
I tried to told ya don't cross that bridge
Without permission from the St. Lunatics

[Interlude 3: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Ladies and gentlemen, we got the big Snoop Dogg in the house tonight
He just came from off tour
And he wanna tell y'all little bit about where he come from

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg + Jermaine Dupri]
Palm trees, bad bitches and wannabees
O.G.'s like me eatin' on pollaseeds
Now & Laters, jellybeans, and Wallabees
Real niggas from the set I hardly ever seen
Mostly heard, sell a bird off the cizzurb
And when we dip, we hop and then we swizzerve
A lot of homies like to wear the pizzerm
Hair longer than hers, sharp with the fizzur
Doggy Dizzogg, you know I like to bizzall
Like Kobe to Shaq so take that
Take that, take that
Long Beach is on the motherfuckin map
The city by the sea, R.I.P
JD, you know about the LBC
My niggas love the Steelers, cold hearted killas
Real cap peelers, real niggas feel us
Ain't no squeelers, a lot of dope dealers
Bang diggy dang dang Dogg Pound Gangsta Crip Gang
Yeah we do the damn thang
Go to Pomona, scoop up Kokane
Head to the church house to get a little workout
Smoke out, drink up, now put ya bank up
It's all on me, I got a scenery to stank up
Crank up the beat, raise up the heat
I'm throwin' a block party on 2-1 Street, fo' sho'

[Outro: Jermaine Dupri + Ludacris]
Welcome to Atlanta remix, hey

293,Song For The Lonely,"I said goodbye to my friends in the city
Sighed to myself to console the love of my own company
Took a walk on the moors just gone midnight
Thought I'd write a song for the lonely

We always say we never ever trust someone to love
They look like conquerors who've laid themselves to rest
And while I revel in self pitied isolation
My bloodless face is still the kingdom of sadness

I said goodbye ...

I let the cool wind blow the hair across my face
I feel a hundred years and a thousand miles away
And my banal attempt to glorify my isolation
Allows this bleak intoxication to go on and on and on",L.O.U.D (Band),2002,"[99, 99, 95, 93, 85, 85]",6

Under a lovers' sky
Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It will steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you

Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

We'll be lost in the rhythm, so right

Killin one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns

Dances around, she struts with the ""fuck"" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk

The way you move to the music - it make a nigga wanna
Take you up outta here, go somewhere, loose it

It's gonna be hard gettin you off the brain
I mean we could take a drive in the X5
The way you boogie on the floor, know that sex slide
You's a dime piece, I'm tryin to see somethin
Suck your t's and in your front and lemme squeeze somethin

Throw a curl in it

Cause home may be calling
Or home some other lark
But as a noonday witness, I'm lost!

Pull the sticky pine
Build some other mind
Cause faith ain't enough, ain't enough
For as God's my pilot I need Him to make the charts
To route my escape from this heart

I'm looking right at you, but you're not there
I'm seeing right past you, but you seem well aware
Your body is here but your mind is somewhere else
So far gone and you think I can't tell
Can't tell that you are disconnected
You pulled away and I miss your presence
I always said to you

Baby you should be here, right here

And hoped that love had a happy ending

301,U Got It Bad,"[Intro]
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ouh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies say: ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back

If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track

I'm more than some pretty face beside a train

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd but don't be naïve
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed but won’t you concede
Even Heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up, up and away, away from me
Well, it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for kryptonite on this one way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me
Inside of me, inside of me

You ain't seen bouncin' back

I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gone respect me, appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much want to see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
Know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep ya chin up
And sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me

No matter what happened, that's only once, it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then its shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble you didn't want learn
Sometimes we be getting so rude you ain't want see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take strides and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody say fool you better keep on rapping
Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happen
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life a be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

Hmm-huh, I know you change ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news

You was right in the middle complaining and forgot what you was cryin bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long

A time, a space, a different place, how perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day you'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry you know I must do what I must do

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Bridge: Stephen Marley] (Mos Def)
Well and it's not easy, Jah knows how I try I try
So don't you get weary (Oh God)
Jah knows how I try, I try

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
And God knows, that life is one big road
With a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the sites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
It's no valley low and it's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shining right through my heart
So my journey must start

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

You know what?
Got something to say
Craig David
7 days
Check it out, yeah

[Verse 1]
On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

[Pre-Chorus]
Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, ""Love to rendezvous""
She asked me, ""What we were gonna do?""
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I oh-oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a man to play around, baby (Oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing off my phone
When you feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me

[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday

Ooh

Another day has almost come and gone
Can’t imagine what else could wrong
Sometimes I’d like to hide away somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost but not the war

[Chorus: Jo Dee Messina]
'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

[Verse 2: Jo Dee Messina with Tim McGraw]
It’s almost like the hard times circle ‘round
A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated
I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing
But I’m not dead

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

No, I’m not gonna let it get me down

Me and my girls shrivel all over the world
Makin you stumble and hurl, braids ponytails and the curls

Jumpin and gettin it down, sweatin and workin it now
No question, gonna throw on them clothes tonight
So set them bows tonight, engines gon' hum on the bikes

Shoppin at the mall, don't care what it cost
Concerned about who be in my sheets
You got beef with me? Then don't speak to me

Garbage and the waste, ""please get out my face""
You wanna taste? Miss me like I'm Mase
You wanna taste? Like me William H
I'm leavin y'all toothless like Gerome
Rollin on the chromes, two ways and the phones
This Philly chick ain't wit this silly shit
Blunts and dutches licked, scrapin up for rent

Keep 'em bub-bel-in, take it on the chin
So now they all duckin from the slugs
Kisses and the hugs, just cut up the rug!

Gettin nice at the bar, bang it loud in your car
I'm from the town, niggas gon' hold me down
Lost but now I'm found, watch me snatch the crown
I clear my throat, ladies spit what I wrote
Takin off my coat, stuntin tryin to poke
We in the back, countin and peelin the stacks
Combin and brushin the tracks--y'all can't hold me back

[Intro: Alabama 3 sample (Nas)]
Woke up this mornin' (yeah)
You got yourself a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yourself a gun

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 1]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody!

[Chorus]
I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

[Chorus]
I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 3]
It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)

And I’m the one you call when you need to get a dick
But I don’t need it all, I just want a little bit
And when we done with it, we be back up on our shit
And that’s the shit I like and that’s the shit you like too
Shit, that’s probably why I like you, now I don’t sit here and say just what I might do
Because actions speak louder and I like proof

Who sits upon our skies
How deep do you see when you spy into our lives?

I know that God lives in everybody's souls
And the only devil in your world
Lives in the human heart

So now ask yourself
What is human
And what is truth
Ask yourself
Whose voice is it that whispers unto you
From the cellars of your homes
From the tops of your city roofs
Ask yourself
Whose voice is it that whispers unto you

Who is it?
That turns your blood into spirit and your spirit into blood

Who is it?
That can reach down from above and set yours souls ablaze with love
Or fill you with the insanity of violence and it's brother lust

Who is it?
Whose words have been twisted beyond recognition
In order to build your planet Earth's religions

Who is it?
Who could make your little armies of the left
And your little armies of the right
Light up your skies tonight

Now some of you may live
And some of you may die
But remember
That nothing in your world can kill you inside
For he is thinking of you
In your great cities of great solitude

When moonlight crawls along the street
Chasing away the summer heat
Footsteps outside somewhere below
The world revolves, I let it go
We build our church above this street
We practice love between these sheets
The candy sweetness scent of you
It bathes my skin, I'm stained in you
And all I have to do is hold you
There's a racing within my heart
And I am barely touching you

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on
Never stop
Wanna taste every drop
My love for you is
Insatiable

The moonlight plays upon your skin
A kiss that lingers takes me in
I fall asleep inside of you
There are no words
There's only truth
Breathe in, breathe out
There is no sound
We move together up and down
We levitate, our bodies soar
Our feet don't even touch the floor
And nobody knows you like I do
Cause the world, they don't understand
But I grow stronger in your hands

Turn the lights down low
Take it off
Let me show
My love for you is
Insatiable
Turn me on

Wanna taste every drop

322,Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),"[Verse 1]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

[Verse 2]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God

Feel broken down

You gotta fight for somethin', stand for somethin'
That's what the poem told me
It was a greater poet like you know it but
I'd rather talk about how my neck is frozen and I
I'd write a song about the banging hoes and then
Stay up in the bitches while she dozing

[Chorus: French Montana]
When I went to my brotha, told him, ""Help me please""
Now we hop out the PJs posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', ""Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe""

Flacko, I wonder how it feel to live or be like you

Mama hubby got life, he got three strikes too
Real niggas bleed like me, like you
That's why I got a beam with a green light too

I'm just stayin' on my Qs and my Ps like soup
Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

Young man, brotha-brotha, gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', brotha understand, God don't make the plays

This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt

334,Drops Of Jupiter (Tell Me),"[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey

[Chorus 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus 2]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?

This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time

The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

343,Riding With Private Malone,"[Verse 1]
I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that said, ""old Chevy"" somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand

[Verse 2]
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green Army tarp
And when I pulled the cover off, it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty-six Corvette

[Verse 3]
I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
What a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteen sixty-six and this is what he wrote

[Chorus]
He said, ""My name is Private Andrew Malone
And if you're reading this, then I didn't make it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of mine, now it belongs to you
And though you may take her and make her your own
You'll always be riding with Private Malone""

[Verse 4]
Well, it didn't take me long at all, I had her running good
I loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shining like a diamond and I'd put the ragtop down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town

[Verse 5]
The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldie show, especially late at night
I'd get the feeling sometimes, if I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier ridin' shotgun in the seat right next to me

[Chorus]
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
He told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone

[Bridge]
Well, one night it was raining hard, I took the curve too fast
I still don't remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt

[Chorus]
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered, another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
And I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
Yeah, that night, I was riding with Private Malone
Oh, thank God, I was riding with Private Malone

Said she knew I was a baller by my iced out wrists

See a fine chick, you know I'm gon' grab her

Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain

351,I'm Tryin',"[Chorus]
I'm sorry that I can't get out of bed
I'm sorry that my head's always a mess
I'm sorry that I missed your call
For the third time in a row
I promise that I care much more than I show

[Verse]
Don't get carried away, no
I'll only let you down
Certain circumstances got me feeling low
Don't take it personally
Talk some sense into me, I’ve been feeling senseless
Acting selfish, hate myself so fucking much, I’m out of touch
But I can see through all the lies that they’ve been selling me
Quit telling me you know they know what's best for me
My patience being tested, see
In the parking lot of the high school that I went to
Thought I hated it, but it's real shit when your friends leave
And you're back home with the same dreams
On the same street
All of the things that I’ve taken for granted is now
Everything that I wish hadn’t ended
All that I hated is now what I miss
Ain't that a bitch

[Chorus]
I'm sorry that I can't get out of bed

I think us bad bitches is a gift from God (Gift from God)
I think you broke hoes need to get a job (Get a job)
Now I'm a boss, I write my own name on the checks (Cardi)
Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex
I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it
Gucci shoes and a belt like it
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ayy, these heels are Givenchy, ho
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ayy

I like niggas that been in and outta jail

The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spend what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none (Give 'em none)
If they can't make you richer, they can't make you cum

And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

[Verse 2]
And it's been awhile since I could say that I wasn't addicted and
It's been awhile since I could say I love myself as well and
It's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again, again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, and I know it's me

We talk about your church and your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you've been having with your brother
About your daddy and your mother and your crazy ex-lover
We talk about your friends and the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the dimples on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes
You know talking about you makes me smile
But every once in awhile

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one

I wanna talk about me (me, me, me, me)

[Verse 2]
We talk about your dreams and we talk about your schemes
Your high school team and your moisturizer cream
We talk about your nanna up in Muncie, Indiana
We talk about your grandma down in Alabama
We talk about your guys of every shape and size
The ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
We talk about your heart, about your brains and your smarts
And your medical charts and when you start
You know talking about you makes me grin
But every now and then

[Chorus]
I wanna talk about me
Wanna talk about I
Wanna talk about number one
Oh my me my
What I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see
I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually, but occasionally

356,Dig In,"Yes sir, everyday got to jump in the text
'Cause He's the better way, yeah, the Son is the best
That trash: I'll pass on the pump and the vest
Got the sword of the Spirit, I run to the text
I run to the best answer for every question
It's got every teaching, every lesson
That we could ever need for reppin'
Jesus, yes sir, He's a blessing
We got to read His Holy Word
To deny this bible's so absurd
I deny my pride, and God is first
So I got to dive inside His Word
What other way could we know how to live this thing?
It's inspired by the Spirit, man
So listen man, the very Word of God is in the scriptures, man
We got to see its God breathed, and it's His will for all creeds
All races, all nations, Genesis to Revelation
So get up in it if you want to know
His will revealed through the Son and more
It's real, but you'll feel dumb to go
Without it as a Saint it will stunt your growth
But bro you supposed to grow much closer
To Jehovah bro He wrote you
All we need to grow as soldiers
And show other folks, we 'posed to
So grab your pen, pencil, highlighter, and your commentary
And dig deep in the scriptures, Jesus with us He can carry

Bible, check; spiral, check, highlighter check
Now dig (dig in it), dig (dig in it)
You want to know Him? Got to dig (dig) dig (in)
You want to know Him? Got to dig (dig) dig (in)

Where all my cats who know the bible's solid?
Grinding off in bible college, getting it in with Psalms and Prophets
Becoming urban bible scholars
Yearning, learning all the knowledge
Then putting it to use now that you got it
We need it, must read it, Jesus He is pleased with solid doctrine
Where all my cats who get up in the Word and love it?
Not just when they be up in the church in public
But in private they dive in, it be on they mind, they be thinking of it
We need that, read that, see that Jesus gets the glory He deserves
And the only way we can know His ways is if we stay up in His Word
He inspired it through writers they was carried along
The Spirit inspired the bible so all its merit is strong
Yes sir He breathed it Theopneustos
So if you trying to move close
Then get it, live it, give it to some faithful men that you know
Hope your passion is real passionate
Everybody in the faith got to master this
He ain't just write the Bible for the Pastor kid
So how we all gon' slack with it?
We got to get up in it heavy and be ready to live it out
This is for my Christians in it trying to figure scripture out

It may seem hard to understand at times
But depend on the Lord He handed down
Scriptures pointing to Himself don't just try to stack knowledge to cram in your mind
It ain't about knowledge you stack or all the doctrine you pack
Inside your mind man God's design was not just for you to find the facts
Don't be like them Pharisees, man they knew the scripture good
But from the looks of things apparently they ain't know all that they should
The Jews was searching the scriptures looking for life, the eternal kind
But for certain they was missing Christ John 5, 39
But don't get twisted man they intentions was great
But they was missing the faith, they had it twisted mistake
So get up in them right, they a witness of the Christ
Search it learn it then stick it in your life
Listen to the Christ's works and person
And perfect is a description of Him right?
Then pass it along to some faithful dudes
So cats will get strong and convey the truth
To others we love to discover truth and pass to our other brothers
Did I st-stutter? We got to follow Christ and His Father and the Spirit inside us guides us in the Word that's the model",116,2002,"[82, 80, 76, 70, 61, 51, 43, 36]",8

And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future, then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen

Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!
(That's just one bum you should've told)
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me

Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'

Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me

You better check yourself, respect yourself
You better go for self because I flow for self
You gets no love from me

I'll tell you why there's no love
Simply you're not cool enough
For what we had between us
Don't you know you lost my trust

People ask me where you've been
And I tell them we're just friends
'Cause it's so obvious that it's never gonna work for us
Oh no, no

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotion

Hearing all the lies you tell

Yo, how the situation get so raw
To the point we don't kiss no more
Things I miss, you don't miss no more
That night I met you on the disco floor
Every night since missed you more
Making hits on tour
Now when I knock, you don't answer the door
The phone ring, you don't answer no more
'Cause you ain't tryna chance it no more
Got to find me a new diva
Something pretty for P. Diddy and his two-seater

Now you could never have a piece of my love
So when you see me don't reach for no hug
And don't speak in the club
Don't tell me how you deeply in love
Other day you tried to greet me with thugs
That wanted to heat me with slugs
See the message on my beeper was bugged
Try to chill, lay deep in the cut
But you keeping it up
Even my girl think of beating you up
The way you keeping in touch
She don't know if niggas cheating or what

But you couldn't handle it

Play with my emotions, you gets no devotion

That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company

I never thought you were a fool
But darling look at you
You gotta stand up straight
Carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere, baby

Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment

I will not forsake
The colors that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
And you are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2]
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Swag mania, pop that goes most, carry the most
Beautiful bitches with us happily toast
Keep the faculty close, gross when we give them a dose
Got them OD-ing, leaning in each Coast
Scenery froze, take notes, rock Rolls, diamonds that fit us
Chanel minks in the winter, who fucking with us?
We coming to give them the shivers, watery flows spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Uhh, shit
Please don't throw up, hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas, we gon' show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars it's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball so what's cracking with y'all?

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Native New Yorker, the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter, stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily, God I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

And you listening to Q-Tip

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making it though
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done, rip up your paper 'cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
You're just a single cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff?
Beat him in the head, boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, ""Stop killing me, wolf""
Whop, beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
Oxy in me pulse, he don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit we sinners, when me and Abstract together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners, pillar of this rap shit, homie they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music, iTune it, YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas, drink Alizé liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us and her man's attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus, we're prone to handle
We're gentlemen

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
Not to mention, we're veterans, second, he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless, it's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it, I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left

Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather

Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts

But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time!
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo

The doctor gave me 30 days
But I must have had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace

Even if this love's to die for
Because your bags are packed and I ain't crying
You're walking out and I'm not trying to change your mind
Because I was born to be

Who loves her kids and never stops

I'm a survivor

[Verse 2]
I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
Though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I want to be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance

383,Burn,"[ELIZA]
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said

“Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.”

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you…

I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn",Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,2002,"[99, 99]",2

392,The Star Spangled Banner,"[Verse]
Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream
'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more
Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""
And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave",Whitney Houston,2002,"[97, 80]",2
393,Never Too Far/Hero Medley,"[Verse 1]
You're with me
Til the bitter end
What we have transcends
This experience
Too painful to
Talk about
So I'll hold it in
Til my heart can mend
And be brave enough to love again

[Pre-Chorus]
A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

[Chorus 1]
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
Always remember
Love

[Verse 2]
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus 2]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Bridge]
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

[Chorus 2]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Outro]
Nobody can take your place

394,AM To PM,"[Hook]
I still move work, from the A.M. to the P.M
Niggas got beef, I'mma spray 'em when I see 'em
I'mma spray 'em when I see 'em
I'mma spray 'em when I see 'em

[Verse 1]
I pump on the street from the A.M. to the P.M
A nigga want beef, I'mma spray him when I see him
Lay 'em when I see him, AK 'em when I see him
Hop out the Bronco and O.J. him when I see him
Cut a bone out his skin, fish filet him when I see him
Then wire his grill, Kanye him when I see him
My young'uns on they job, so I pay 'em when I see 'em
Turn Boyz II Men, I'll Wanya 'em when I see 'em
Cause I be on the grind from the P.M. to the A.M
Paint pictures with my rhymes, you can see 'em when I say 'em
My songs like movies you can see 'em when you play them
If a nigga want beef, when I see 'em I'mma spray 'em
For six G's, I could get your whip swiss cheesed
I'm like a red nosed pit, you a mixed breed
Bitch please, all 'em dudes in your crew ass
I'll get you strangled with the strings on your doo-rag

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'mma let you niggas talk all stupid, 'til you get hawked all stupid
Sparked all stupid, outlined in chalk all stupid
Dog I bite I don't bark all stupid, it is what it is
I'm in the coupe roof dropped all stupid
Fitted hat cocked all stupid, gettin' top all stupid
My clientele cop all stupid
We make sales on the block all stupid, it is what it is
It's a fact that I rap all stupid
Get your wig pushed back all stupid
We strapped all stupid, I'll get you clapped all stupid
Don't let the pills and the 'yac make you act all stupid
Yeah, I do my thing all stupid, let my chain bling all stupid
My ring all stupid and my earring all stupid
I got them things and I sling all stupid, stupid

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, my flow'll have you amazed and astonished
I been hot since I copped my first Sega with Sonic
Back in the days, when Shawn Kemp played for the sonics
I rocked the huge jeans and I played the Etonics
You know I blow haze, I be blazing the chronic
It got my mind scrambled like the egg in a omelette
I talk to God every day, and he made me a promise
Me and T like Malcolm and Elijah Muhammad
Me and Swizz like Martin and Jesse
But the fact that I can get assassinated, is starting to stress me
I ain't tryna let the police department arrest me
But I still keep steel tucked under the fresh tee
And I ain't just rapping for my health
So before you diss me, you be betta off clappin' at yourself
Cause I ain't tryna battle on the mic
I have them goons hop out on you like they did Harold at the light

395,Smooth Criminal,"[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Interlude]
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

[Outro]
Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it-baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment, (Dag gone it)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Dag gone it)
It was your doom Annie",Michael Jackson,2002,[83],1
396,Where I Come From,"Songtekst van Zack Ink - Where I Come From (ft. 3robi & LouiVos)

[Hook: Zack Ink]
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns

[Verse 1: Zack Ink]
Snel geld, fast life
Breng je spullen naar mij, ik kan het snel kwijt
Ik kan straight met je praten als je cash draait
Broer ik zit er net in maar ik cash uit
Ze komt net van mij, ze zit nu met hem thuis
Ze snapt me en ze zegt me hij heeft geld thuis
Zulke dingen zie je vaak in mijn stad
De block is heet en ze zetten m'n wijk af
Er is handel sowieso als je in m'n stad komt
Je gaat vallen je valt op, vertrekt met een tas vol
M'n kleine pirie is boos, hij loopt met een handgun
Zerodix fuck 'm all, they know where I come from

[Hook: Zack Ink]
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns

[Verse 2: LouiVos]
Herres, herres, where I come from
Ben begonnen op de- uitkijk man
Sbe3, sbe3, kijk uit man
Ben met burgemeester, echt een stackman
Meer papier hier, dan de paagman
Jij stijlt ook, ewa dress dan
Ik en drerrie doen je denken aan de yesman
Als ik langsloop, zegt ze yes man
Low-key netjes, smooth criminel
Playboy, pluk je kip, crime passionel
Keuken, whip whip, professionnel
Pak zwart en wit net Chocomel
White guys, ik ren net running man
Mijn guys, ik gun, net Unicef
Zack Ink, WW, straight hooligan
Veel vuur, brandbaar net drukke tent

[Hook: Zack Ink]
Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from
Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns
Everybody know where I come from

Boys om me heen die zijn dom, dom
En ze praten niet veel, trekken guns, guns

[Verse 3: 3robi]
Ben met Vos, ik boss, ik ram man
3 keer X motherfack Amsterdam man
Gekke moetroes voor de police
Gekke gannoes zijn verdeeld over m'n homies
Ik voel me wijzer met die ijzer
Streng, boos, net een keizer
Ik heb die gannoe voor die motherfacker
Ik ben met spua, jij met alles pakkers

Everybody know where I come from
Rotterdam is the city where I come from

397,God Bless America,"[Verse 1]
While the storm clouds gather far across the sea
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free
Let us all be grateful that we are far from there
As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer

[Verse 2]
God bless America, land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above
From the mountains to the prairies
To the oceans white with foam
God bless America, my home sweet home
God bless America, my home sweet home",Irving Berlin,2002,[100],1
