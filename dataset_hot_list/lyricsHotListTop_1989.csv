0,Another Day In Paradise,"[Verse 1]
Her body's gold like September
She burns through the night like an ember
And all those things we tried forgetting i remember
But we say we all fine we all fine
Sunny day dreams and we up now
Vodka lemonade I serve it up it goes down
75 degrees and a dope sound
All you need to live fine to live fine
A little sunshine cause she need it
A dose of rainfall in the evening
The waves crash down and we feel them
Say here’s to the nights we steal them
And I be running cause I figured out
The more I slow down the less I get out
And if we fall lets be strong now
Moving along we don’t mind we don’t mind

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fire
No need to leave, spend our whole lives
Another day in paradise

[Verse 2]
I be gone till November
Going through the letters that I send her
And think about the moment that I met her
Well I’ll be back in due time in due time
Touchdown throw off my own two shoes
Still the same city I be used to
And all the reckless things that we do
Keep us young, they're good signs they're good signs
Take a little more if you need it
Voices of the night won’t mislead it
The tide pulls me in but it takes slow
Here’s to the nights we let go
And I’m hoping that they figure out
It’s all about the scenery along the route
No fears and no problems
These moments are so kind, they're so kind

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fight
No need to leave, spend the whole night
Another day in paradise

[Bridge]
I don’t need what I’ve sowed
I just need something good
And I know when we’re old
We’ll look back and say “some
Mistakes we made, they made us who we are
These games we played they got us really far""
That shit to most won’t ever mean a thing
But it got us here, so I hold on

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fight
No need to leave, spend the whole night
Another day in paradise",Quinn XCII,1989,"[1, 1, 2, 2, 6, 10, 22, 33, 43]",9

To the love I know
I'm ready and willing
Getting out of control

To love with every beat
I just wanna know you
More every day
And now it won't be long
Till I hear you say (say it, say it)
Say that you do boy

8,This One's For The Children,"This is a very serious message
So all of you please listen

There are some people living in this world
They have no food to eat
They have no place to go
But we all are God's children

We've got to learn to love one another
Just remember
They could be us
Remember, we all are brothers

I'm not trying to darken up your day
But help others in need
And show them there's a better way

This one's for the children
The children of the world
This one's for the children
May God keep them in His throne

Many people are happy
And many people are sad
Some people have many things
That others can only wish they had

So for the sake of the children
Show them love's the only way to go
'Cause they are tomorrow
And people, they've got to know

I'm not trying to darken up your day
But help others in need
And show them there's a better way

This one's for the children
The children of the world
This one's for the children
May God keep them in His throne

This one's for the children
The children of the world

9,Living In Sin,"[Verse 1]
I don't need no license
To sign on no line
And I don't need no preacher
To tell me you're mine
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no new bride
I just need you, baby
To look me in the eye
I know they have a hand time
And your Daddy don't approve
But I don't need your Daddy
Telling us what we should do
Now there's a million questions
I could ask about our lives
But I only need one answer
To get me through the night

[Chorus]
So baby, can you tell me just where we fit in
I call it love they call it living in sin
Is it you and me or just this world we live in
I say we're living on love they say we're living in sin

[Verse 2]
Is it right for both our parents
Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights
Or wear that ring of diamonds
When your heart is made of stone
You can talk but still say nothing
You stay together but alone
Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight
They say the promise is forever
If you sign it on the dotted line

[Chorus][x2]

I call it love they call it living in sin

Someone swept your heart away
From the look upon your face, I see it's true

So tell me all about it
Tell me all the plans you're making
Tell me one thing more before I go

Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

I'm too proud for crying
I didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
When even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you

You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I got everything I wanted

A love that seemed strong was not meant to be
Broken hearts don't always mend
Left too unsure to try love again

But, just between you and me

Hearts can be blind to love gone astray
Always it's the same old song
Someone's been hurt by a love that's gone wrong

15,Love Song,"[Intro: Jesy Nelson & Jade Thirlwall]
When you hold me in the street
And you kiss me on the dance floor
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours

[Verse 1: Jade Thirlwall & Jesy Nelson]
We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough
It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy Nelson]
But we know this, we got a love that is hopeless

[Chorus: Perrie Edwards]
Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
When you're with him, do you call his name
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay?

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Girl you know this, we got a love that is hopeless

[Chorus: Perrie Edwards & Jason Derulo]
Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours

[Bridge A: Jason Derulo & Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby
I don't wanna hide us away
Tell the world about the love we making
I'm living for that day, someday

[Bridge B: Jason Derulo & Jesy Nelson]
Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours, I'm yours

[Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock + Jason Derulo]
Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that (I wish)
Why can't it be like that?  (I wish) Cause I'm yours

[Chorus Reprise: Perrie Edwards + Jason Derulo]
Why can't I say that I'm in love?
I wanna shout it from the rooftops

17,When The Night Comes,"Hold on I'll be back for you it won't be long
But for now there's something else that's calling me
So take me down that lonesome road
Point me east and let me go
That suitcase weighs me down with memories

I just want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone when the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes

Two spirits in the night
We can leave before the morning light
When there's nothing left to lose
There's nothing left to fear
So meet me on the edge of town
Won't keep you waiting I'll be around
Then you and I we'll just roll right out of here

I just want to be the one you run to
I just want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone when the night comes
Let's put all our cares behind us
And go where they'll never find us
I just want to be there beside you
When the night comes
When the night comes

I know there'll be a time when you and I
Could take our hands and run away
Pick up all the pieces of this shattered dream
We're gonna make it out some day
We'll be coming back, coming back to stay

I want to be the one you run to
To be the one you come to
I want to be the one you run to

I just want to be the one you run to
I want to be the one you come to
I just want to be there with someone

18,Downtown Train,"[Verse 1]
Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
I climb through the window and down the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

[Verse 2]
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now

[Chorus]
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely, now

[Verse 3]
I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way
You watch them as they fall
Oh baby, they all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

[Chorus]
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Where every night is just the same

Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
All of my dreams just fall like rain
All on a downtown train",Tom Waits,1989,"[19, 19, 30, 36, 40, 54]",6

From the start it's plain to see
You're suffering from a serious broken heart

A sure enough happening thing

I call it, you should be with me

That one and one equals me and you
Don't you know that---

That one and one equals me and you

It's funny that way
You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh father, I have sinned

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you

You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?

Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

30,The Last Worthless Evening,"[Verse 1]
I know you broke up with him
And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself
You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim

I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else
And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

[Chorus 1]
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause I'll be there
When your broken heart is on the mend

[Verse 2]
Every night it's the same old crowd in smoky rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms
I've been around this block a time or two
And I've made some big mistakes
But girl I promise you, I promise you

[Chorus 2]
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

[Bridge]
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin away)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin away)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin)

[Verse 3]
People inside their houses
With the shades pulled down
God knows we could use some romance
In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything
But there are just so many summers, babe
And just so many springs

[Chorus 2]
And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, baby
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance
To show you love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance, darlin
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend 'cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend",Don Henley,1989,"[31, 31, 22, 21, 23, 24, 30, 36, 42, 50, 59, 70, 91]",13

Sky is the limit
If you believe in love

32,Peace In Our Time,"[Verse 1]
Out of the aeroplane stepped Chamberlain
With a condemned man's stare
But we all cheered wildly, a photograph was taken
As he waved a piece of paper in the air
Now the Disco Machine lives in Munich and we are all friends
And I slip on my Italian dancing shoes as the evening descends

[Chorus]
And the bells take their toll once again in victory chime
And we can thank God that we've finally got
Peace in our time

[Verse 2]
There's a man going round taking names no
Matter who you claim to be
As innocent as babies, a mad dog with rabies
You're still a part of some conspiracy
Meanwhile there's a light over the ocean
Burning brighter than the sun
And a man sits alone in a bar and says ""Oh God
What have we done?""

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They're lighting a bonfire upon every hilltop in the land
Just another tiny island invaded when he's got
The whole world in his hands
And the Heavyweight Champion fights in the
International Propaganda Star Wars
There's already one spaceman in the White
House what do you want another one for?

The way that I love you

The second someone mentioned you were all alone

These cigarettes won't stop me wonderin' where you are

36,What Kind Of Man Would I Be?,"[Intro]
You know
We can't do this
We just can't
Listen

[Verse 1]
You say you feel disenchanted
Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you remained and
To hurt so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscing
Temptations so strong not to mention
The yearning inside

[Hook]
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

[Verse 2]
This feeling is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to lose if we blow it
This is no lie
Still, here we are both together
With promises made that we never
Yet feeling it now more than ever
I can't deny

[Hook]
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

[Bridge]
Here we are all alone
But somehow we've got to stay strong

But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully

And you don't need a reason to lie

It won't justify throwing love aside

With the wind run through your hair
I reach for you now
But you're not there

It was perfect time
A perfect place for us to be
The nights were so warm
You were close to me

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
Did I fall in love for nothing?

As the sun started to fade

Was in my mind

Just the other day

I want you back into my life

Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true

I've been down, but I'm up right now

You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead

What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin' on these hoes
Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us
Made a little money, still ain't got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open, don't say nothin'
Motor geeked up like a razor
You don't know me, you must mistake me
For somebody else
But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him

Sitting at home with my dick all hard
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the 7 digits
Said, ""Yo, this Marquis, baby! Are you down with it?""
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny

[Chorus]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

[Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice]
Girls always ask me why I fuck so much
I say ""What's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?""
Cause you're the one, and you shouldn't be mad
I won't tell your mama if you don't tell your dad
I know he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?

Ahh! Me so horny!

You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted
But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted
I'll play with your heart just like it's a game
I'll be blowing your mind while you're blowing my brains
I'm just like that man they call Georgie Puddin' Pie
I fuck all the girls and I make 'em cry

I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny

Ahh! Me so horny!

[Verse 4: Fresh Kid Ice]
It's true, you were a virgin until you met me
I was the first to make you hot and wetty-wetty
You tell your parents that we're going out
Never to the movies, just straight to my house

41,Principal's Office,"[Intro]
Now normally if I can help But I don't spend a lot of time in a principal's office
(RING!!!)
What?
9'o clock

[Verse 1]
Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing
Runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing
And as I get to the office I can hardly speak
Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week
So to my first class I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And as I get to the room I hear the teacher say
""Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today""
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat
So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand
And said, ""Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?""
The teacher got upset, and she screamed out ""No!
It's off the principal's office you go.""

[Verse 2]
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria
Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke cause my front tooth is out of place
So I walked to school with ice on my lip
The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I'm walking, I'm dragging
Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it
Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball
With the late pass I got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says ""What do you know?
It's off to the prinicipal's office you go.""

Recess!

[Verse 3]
Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feelings
Give me a week B, and the girl'll be dealing
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said ""Hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC""
But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes would begin
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me ""You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you""
So then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, the sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter
When I finished the note, it was ready to pass
The teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
Even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late
For me to write another note cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me, and I said ""I know
It's off to the principal's office I go.""

42,I Live By The Groove,"Hey

Everybody loves to feel the beat

No matter where I am
From Detroit City down to Alabam

So I do believe
It's a whole philosophy to me

If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove

If I can hear it, baby

A good groove will
Turn your head around
Lifts you up
When you're feeling down

Get your body moving into gear
That's why the world's
Been turning all these years

It ain't written
In the statute books
It can't be learned in school
It's the law, baby
It's the golden rule

I live by the groove

If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move

You take it slow

You tease me
You've got me begging and out of control
You make love look so easy

I can't sleep

At night
(Must be dreaming)
I can't breathe

To feel, feel the heat

Ooh you're sexing me
Everything you do just turns me on
Ooh you're sexing me

All going down in a landslide

To the river

Of love

56,The Angel Song,"Fallen angel ripped and bruised
Think on better days
Life is rude, treats you bad
Tears your wings away
Raise your eyes to star and sky
Believe in fly always
Take your dreams, your broken schemes
And sweep the past away

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

Hollywood ain't paved with gold
It's just a trick of light
Sunset falls on stars of old
And blinds you with its light
A spiders web of tangled lives
Lays stretched across the hills
From distances it's glistening
Like El Dorado's halls

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

The dream was light
And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scared
Where only fools find gold

Fly lonely angel
High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

Fly lonely angel
Spread your wings another way
Fly lonely angel
Find a better way
A better day",Great White,1989,"[58, 58, 48, 34, 30, 33, 38, 43, 50, 55, 63, 69, 77, 88]",14
57,Listen To Your Heart,"[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 3: T.I]
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash on 'em, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah

And I feel somebody somewhere is trying to breathe

You say I know it's a waste of time
There's no use trying
So scared that life's gonna pass you by
Your spirit dying
Not long ago
I could feel your strength
And your devotion
What was so clear is now overcast
With mixed emotions
Deep in your heart is the answer
Find it
I know it will pull you through

Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action

I think it's true that we've all been through

Let's understand that we're here to
Handle things together
You gotta keep looking onto tomorrow
There's so much in life
That's meant for you

Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action
Get on your feet

69,I Will Survive,"[Intro]
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

[Verse 1]
And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and all my love to give

70,Miss You Much,"[Verse 1]
Shot like an arrow going through my heart
That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot

71,Hide Your Heart,"[Verse 1]
Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire
His fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito, he was king of the streets
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown
Johnny better run, better run

[Chorus]
Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire

[Verse]
The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone
It was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run, better run

[Chorus]

Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night
As time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming 'til he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill
A shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands
With nothing won
When someone lies dying
Lovers finally understand

Break it down
So many times I've been around you
And I know how much I like you
It's like a dream each time I see you
And there's this magic in the air
I feel so shy that I can't approach you
Even though you're just there
But I know that one day I'll get my way
And this is what I'll say
C'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
C'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you

And in my dreams I am with you
And I dance with your silhouette
There are many times I've tried to squeeze you
In these dreams I won't forget
It seems so long we've been together
Since way back then
And only if you knew how much I loved you
You'd turn to me and say.....

Let's just say that our love is right
Would you kiss and hold me tight
Cos I want to hold you and squeeze you
And tell you that I love you
Each and every night
Let's just say that our love is strong
Would you know were you belong
Or would I have to show you and teach you
Hold you and please you to show you that you belong
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you

If there's been a time that I needed you
Then the time is now

When I think I always hear you say....

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one
Savage, I ain't even hatin'""
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage, I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?

They say crack kills, nigga, my crack sells

Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up

I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

[Verse 1]
On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

[Bridge]
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

I didn't mean - I didn't mean to fool around, but baby you held me down

And lately I've been feeling grey but today
I'm alright no thanks to you

Think I'll go and roam outside your boundary
Walk on the ridge. Far away from the city

Be gone, just like you were at the last party

Cause I'm younger but I'm tired and I'm sore

""Admit it, you bit it""
""Niggas bit off Nas shit, niggas, niggas, bit off, Nas shit""
""Admit if, you bit it, bit it""

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a Hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

[Hook]
Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

[Hook - Last line cut off]

""Niggas bit off Nas"" - Ghostface Killah
""Admit it, you bit it"" - G. Dep
""Tell these niggas somethin' God"" - Ghostface Killah

[Verse 3 - Nas]
What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike

You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go

89,Foolish Heart,"I need a love that grows
I don't want it unless I know
That each passing hour
Someone somehow
Will be there, ready to share...

I need a love that's strong
I'm so tired of being alone
But will my lonely heart play the part
Of the fool again
Before I begin

Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore

Feeling that feeling again
I'm playing a game I can't win
Love's knocking on the door
Of my heart once more
Think I'll let her in
Before I begin

Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore

Foolish heart...
Foolish, foolish heart

You've been wrong before

90,Heat Of The Moment,"[Verse 1]

They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

[Chorus]
She asked me
""Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?""
She asked me
""Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?""
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

[Interlude]
What are we even doing?

[Verse 2]
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, ""You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him""
And I say ""Well, goddamn""

[Chorus]
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it

Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.

With J.L. and Lyor we all called Don King
I said ""Yeah, Don I got a problem
>>Tell 'em Prince
Yeah what's up? what you sayin? You tryin' to solve 'em?
Forget the small talk, let's get to the nitty gritty'
Me and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City.""
>>Yo, you got this you gonna bust dude up
Yeah, you can be my trainer
>>Word up?
I'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice
And yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can beat Mike Tyson

>>Man, you can beat him, you can beat him
Yo man, word up
Yo I put on a couple of pounds man we can do this
>>You can do it

>>Extra, extra read all about it. Get this...

[Old men]
>>Ain't that the boy who knocked the guy's head in the fifteenth row?
Hey Leroy, you read the paper?
That boy done lost his mind

[Verse Two: Fresh Prince & //Lawrence the Barber]
There was press conference to see what trainin' I was doing
Before then I had never heard reporters booing
Cameras flashing, I was in the middle
I didn't wanna look dumb so I exagerrated a little
I said, ""Uh, I been trainin' twenty hours a day
Liftin' big old cars and big bails of hay
And I jog 10,000 miles every morning
Thinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory
I drink water, 20 gallons a pop
And I can throw a Volkswagon a whole half block
And 4 million sit ups...in a minute....
..I ain't lyin' I did it!""

The general public thought I was a fool
I was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool
Well gettin' dissed is never good
But I was even gettin' dissed in my old neighborhood
I was at the corner at the top of my block
There was a couple of people standin' outside of the barber shop
It was Lawrence, my barber and friend
And he yelled out:
//Hey, Prince, you can win!
I said 'really?' and I stopped to chat
//You could beat him man, if you hit him wit a bat
//Ha ha...you gon' get wrecked
//But can I have your shoes when he break your neck?
Everybody was laughin' out loud
I thought at least my own Grandma would be proud
I went to her house and snuck in to surpise her
I heard her on the phone
""A thousand bucks on Tyson!""

[Verse Three: Prince, #Ring Announcer]
It's fight day and man am I hyped
Woah, I can't wait to see Mike
Boy I'm hyped, ready to do my thing
Trump Castle Casino [bell rings]
#In this corner...weighin' in at a mere 165 pounds
#The Lightin' Rodent, the Fresh Prince!
#And in this corner
#The heavyweight champion of the world
#Iron Mike Tyson

I came out hustling, slidin' and grabbing
Slippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin'
For a second I looked good out there
But then Mike brought to reality my worst nightmare
One punch, that's all it took (oooh)
He hit me in my ribs and my insides shook
Now how can I say this and be a little discreet?
Let's just say that my bowels released
I called timeout and went back to my corner
Said to my coach, ""Ain't no way I'm goin'
The hell back out there, man you can't forget it
My body's like a punchin' bag and Mike is gonna (Hit it)""
They tried to make me go meet my doom
But I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressin' room
The next day the headline in the town
""Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins, first round""
Some fool asked why I ran away
I said, ""A good run is better than a bad stand any day""
My career is over as far as fightin'
But I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson

[Outro: Prince and >>Jeff as old men]
Hey Leroy!
>>Yeah
Did you see the fight? did you see the fight?
>>The..the..the football player?
No the boxer, come on man
I was at the fight last night
I paid four hundred and seventy fo' thousand dollars
For my ticket right...
>>Ah, you weren't at no fight
>>I seen you around here last night
..and the boy..the boy ran out the ring
>>You always lying
I ain't lying...
>>You lie to your grandkids..
..I seen it...
>>...you been lyin' ever since you was a little kid
...Mike Tyson punched the boy in his ribs, and his leg fell off
His leg fell off and it fell over...

There’s a voice in my head that drives my heel
It’s my baby calling
Says ""I need you here""
And it’s half past four and I’m shifting gear

When she’s lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don’t need no phone at all
We’ve got a thing that’s called Radar Love
We’ve got a wave in the air

The radio’s playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee’s ""Coming on Strong""
The road has got me hypnotized
And I’m speeding into a new sunrise

When I get lonely and I’m sure I’ve had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
Don’t need no letter at all
We’ve got a thing that’s called Radar Love
We’ve got a line in the sky
Radar Love

[Verse 3]
No more speed I’m almost there
Gotta keep cool now gotta take care
Last car to pass here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow
And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee’s ""Coming on Strong""
And the newsman sang his same song
One more radar love is gone

Oh baby don’t get caught up
Don’t surrender to the touch
You can say anything your heart’s dreaming of

But don’t call it love
Call it a longing
Call it a yearning
Don’t call it love
Call it a sweet dream
Shh don’t say nothing

It’s like a beautiful car crash
That two people could lie in
Nobody gets hurt and
No one’s left behind

And when I dive into your light
We swim past the riptide
And maybe this is everything
Yeh that we’ve been waiting for

And it's lost in a thought
Never seen, never caught
And it's in a thought
Never seen, never caught
And it's lost in a thought
Never seen, never caught

[Verse]
And it's lost in a thought
In a sun, in a moon
In a cloud, in the air
In a scream, there's a tear
There's a stab, on a slab
Now the future eats a past
And it's shrinking, and it's fast
There's a mind, there's a hive
There is life, there is not
There's a name I forgot
There's a breath, not a thought
There's a lake, there's a snake
There's a knife giving life
There's a fool reaching up
To a star that erupts
In a flood rising up
To a nothing that is coming!
And it's hungry like a monkey!
There is blood in my eye
There is truth in a lie
There's a dog, ease of mind
There's a wire, there's a bind
I perceive, I don't breathe
I become, I'm undone
In the unseen there is love
There is ruin on the one
There's a rip, there's a drift
Stealing bliss from your lip
I'm insane, you're insane
Cut a vein in my brain
There's a trap, there's a catch
There's a golden shining arrow
There's a cancer in a marrow
There's a flame in a hand
There's a kneeling Glowing Man
There's a rope reaching up
To a sky, to a lie
In a spiral there's a tide
There's a flood, let's give up
There's a hand, there's a mouth
There's a stair winding down
To your chest, to your guts
Hold it in, don't give up
There's a dream, there's a sheen
There's an endless silver stream
There's a song, now there's not
Never caught, never lost
There's a sound coming now
In a cloud hanging down
Never played, uncontained
And it's growing, and it's flowing
And unfolding, and it's showing
In a lung, in a child
There's a fire running wild
In a mind, on a line
Parallel to a cross
There's a place, I forgot

Question existence until them questions are solved

I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches

These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

Gave some molly to that bitch, now she wanna do somethin'

Out on Holly, past 1:30, bitch, we tryna move somethin'
In the morning, was flashin' early, I was goin' through somethin'

Old niggas on that old shit, it's a young nigga time
A bigger picture, bigger difference, it's a young nigga rhyme
Head over water, he say all he do is step with that iron

124,The Same Love,"[Verse 1:]
You and me
We had a love that was forever
That's what I thought

And I can still remember
Words you said
You said we'd always be together
Then why am I alone tonight?

Something changed now
You just don't feel the same
I'll never understand

[Chorus:]
How can the same love
That made me so happy
Make me so sad?
I don't understand

How could the same eyes
That used to be laughing
Cry in the night?
It doesn't seem right at all

Remembering the nights
We held onto each other
The times you told me
You'll never love another

Remembering when I was
All you ever needed
Where are you when I need you now?

Summer days have left me
Standing in the rain
Somebody tell me how

126,Don't Ask Me Why,"[Verse 1]
One hundred years ago in a little town in Minnesota
Lived a boy who called himself McGill
He sat by the windowsill
And dreamed until the day went still
And in the dark, he'd dream a little more
And then, one day, there came along
A girl who sang a pretty song
With a freckled face, she called herself Marie
She said, ""Hey 'Gill you wouldn't believe
What lies out there beyond those trees --
Would you let me take you out to see?

[Chorus 1]
So pack up your bags and fly
You've got some living before you die
I've got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why

[Verse 2]
So Marie and 'Gill, they took to the hills
And climbed a hundred miles until
They found a spot where they could be at ease
It was the highest point that they could see
Rose far above the tallest trees
So naturally, they became king and queen
But before they'd laid their regal grounds
The sky had darkened all around
The heavens broke, and rain began to fall
The lightning cracked, the thunder clapped
And soon the king and queen were trapped
On an island sinking in the rising flood
Well poor Marie, she said, ""The end's begun!
I've always had a place to run
I'm certain that this night will be our last.""
But 'Gill said, ""Marie, well you wouldn't believe
What lies inside of you and me --
Take my hand and we can be at peace.""

[Chorus 2]
So lay down and close your eyes
You've got some dreaming before you die
I got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Lay down and close your eyes
You've got some dreaming before you die
I've got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why

[Bridge]
I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last
I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last
I'm afraid that I've made a mistake choosing to stay
(I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last)
I'm afraid that I've made a mistake choosing to stay
(I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last)

[Verse 3]
For forty hours the storm raged on
And Gill, he said, ""I had it wrong --
If we don't leave we're surely gonna die.""
But sweet Marie, she said, ""I see the light --
My dear McGill, you had it right
We just needed a little faith before we fly!
Because I've dreamed of what this world could be
In all its possibility
And I'll be damned if I don't get to see
So take my hand and hold it tight
We're gonna make it out alright
Jump with me and promise to believe.""

[Chorus 3]
Oh, pack up your bags and fly
We've got some dreaming before we die
We've got this feeling, don't ask us why
Don't ask us why, don't ask us why

[Outro]

Though all the wealth of men was mine to squander
And towers of ivory rose beneath my feet
Were palaces of pleasure mine to wander

Though every soul would hold my name in honor
And truest love was always by my side
My praises sung by grateful sons and daughters
My soul would never still be satisfied

Till my shoes were filled with blood

Or spend the centuries seeking light within
Though I indulged my every dark desire
Exhausting every avenue of sin

Till my shoes were filled with blood
It's not enough, it's not enough

Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone

Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down

He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone

It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean

I keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, a-aaah

[Verse 1: Julie Walters & Christine Baranski]
Last night
I was taking a walk
Along the river
And I saw him together
With a young girl
And the look
That he gave her
Made her shiver

[Pre-Chorus: Julie Walters & Christine Baranski]
'Cause he always used
To look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
Ah-ha-ha
It’s a game he likes to play

[Chorus: Amanda Seyfried]
Look into his angel eyes
One look and you’re hypnotized
He’ll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You’ll think you’re in paradise
And one day you’ll find out he wears a disguise
Don’t look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Amanda Seyfried]
Sometimes when I’m lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time
When I see him will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha
How can I forget that name?

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you’re hypnotized
He’ll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You’ll think you’re in paradise
And one day you’ll find out he wears a disguise
Don’t look too deep into those angel eyes

[Chorus 2: Amanda Seyfried]
Crazy ‘bout his angel eyes
Angel eyes
He took my heart, now I must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You’ll think you’re in paradise
And one day you’ll find out he wears a disguise
Don’t look too deep
Into those angel eyes

Yeah, la-da-da, la-da-da-da, yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they swarmed me
Niggas is jealous, fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try to sell us? Probably why I'm rebellious
To a fraud nigga, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made, they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll out on you and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and your homie chilling
And you know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
And stay away from them haters cause they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small circle, I ain't never really 'round squares
They say there's levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bulls
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly, this your car?
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
And that was and-one, they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't D me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like Champ Bailey but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Gold AP all bust down, fuck clowns

[Hook: Meek Mill]
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
They said I wouldn't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day, only Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Dedicated, determinated and disciplined
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking, I'm listening
When I be in the jungle, the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling
That was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur, I was like ""told y'all""
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's gon' knock out your medulla
Oblongata, I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he gon' probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though it might derail me
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did

[Interlude: Diddy]
Ayo, it gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you ""you acting different nigga""
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister
Your mother, your father, that shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen
You done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
You got raised, you done played in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son? You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame? You sure you want this power?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit
Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers
Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them
Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?
Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got
Don't let this money bring us down
Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats
Let's go, hahahah

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, yeah
And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs
And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember Sundays we ain't have nothing but Liv
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
And your main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant, Metta Peace and Gasol, nigga
But I know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
As long as Papi smiling
I'mma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit, I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it

141,Don't Wanna Lose You,"[Verse 1:]
Sometimes it's hard to make things clear

And I know when the moment is here
I'll open my heart and show you inside

My love has no pride
I feel with you
I've got nothing to hide
So open your eyes and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now forever

Baby, I finally found the courage
To stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around forever

We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time
And I hope that's the way it will stay

It's all up to you to tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know that

And you forgot just how a woman feels

You didn't know what Rock 'n' Roll was
Until you met a drummer on a Greyhound bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Well in the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh-so cold
You're gettin' tired, you're lookin' kinda beat
The music of the street, drive you off your feet

You didn't know how rock 'n' roll looked
Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group
Half-way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eyes she was givin' what she got

Once bitten twice shy, babe
Once bitten twice shy, babe

Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep
All the blood on my hand and my Les Paul heat
I can't leave you home 'cos you're runnin' around
My best friend told me you're the best trick in town

You didn't know that Rock 'n' Roll burned
So you bought a candle and you loved and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed
Mamma's little baby likes it short and sweet

Once bitten twice shy, babe

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

[Verse 2]
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face

Pero chica, mi amiga, ¿que dice?
Esto es yo, esto es yo y como hablo y hablo así y hablo así contigo

Down this wild street walks, walks a child with no trace
Of ever being as young as her sister is
A local neighborhood crush the boys would hide out and watch
Her hanging washing on the line all the time

[Chorus:]
More like a woman, she dress like one
She was the first girl
She was the first girl to turn the boys on

Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young Making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone she blows them kisses on the wind
Te compraste una bomba pero no me importa
At the corner shop, halfway down the block
All the radios pumping to the way she walks
Past the flyboys art, where her name's engraved
Sweet liberty is what it says
More like a woman, she dress like one
She was the first girl, she was the first girl, to turn the boys on
Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone she blows them kisses on the wind
Te compraste una bomba
Pero no me importa, qué te digo, hombre, mi amigo
Ah it doesn't matter, you know what I'm saying
Ah no, forget it because I'm going there man you know?
You can follow me but you know what I'm saying don't make me say it
Ah, no sé (okay, me voy)

The price of puberty's got a way of showing
It doesn't come in easy stages
Her mother's face in the pot, won't ever leave it

POP'S BARBERSHOP

POP: They lose 65 games only to end up with the fourth pick in the draft. Did they tank that shit on purpose?

SHAMEEK: Read the words, Pop.
Right there on the wall.

FISH: Brother's got a point, Henry, much as I hate to admit that.

SHAMEEK: That's right. Pay up.

POP: You're right, you're right. I shouldn't have cursed. My bad, Lonnie.

LONNIE: It's okay, Pop.

POP: All right.

SHAMEEK: What's their record this year, anyway, like?

POP: 17 and 65. You know that Russian kid they drafted? He better be good.

FISH: He's Latvian. What they need to do is fire Phil Jackson.

POP: Wait a minute, Phil Jackson ain't out there playing no more.

SHAMEEK: Phil Jackson overrated, B. Anybody can win with Jordan and Kobe.

POP: Phil ain't no Pat Riley.

CHICO: Aw, Riley, again?

POP: Yeah.

SHAMEEK: Here we go.

CHICO: I mean, Pacino Now, I get why that white boy makes your free haircut list.

FISH: The Godfather and Scarface guaranteed that man an eternal ghetto pass.

CHICO: Carlito's Way, too. But Pat Riley? Why does Pat Riley get so much love in this shop?

SHAMEEK: Right. Even punk-ass Derek Fisher got more rings than Pat Riley.

POP (indicating the swear jar): Uh-uh.

SHAMEEK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

LUKE: 'Cause the Knicks played like men when Pat Riley was head coach. Oakley and Ewing went hard in the paint. Plus Anthony Mason and John Starks Drive the lane, you might go home in a body bag.

POP: All right, now I heard that.

LUKE: Later with all that Instagramming, ""let's all max contract on the same team together"" bullcrap - passing as competition nowadays.

SHAMEEK: Didn't Pat Riley sign those Instagram dudes down in Miami when he became the GM?

LUKE: Maybe. But King James is the truth. LeBron can ball.

POP: Yeah.

CHICO: Now pay up, Luke. You said ""bullcrap.""

LUKE: ""Bullcrap"" ain't a curse, man. I don't curse.

SHAMEEK (mockingly):  ""I don't curse."" You don't cut hair either, negro. Like, really, what do you do up in here, bruh?

LUKE: I sweep hair, Shameek.
I also mop, I wash the towels, and I make sure that plate glass window stays spotless. It's called work. Something you would never understand.

SHAMEEK: Slam Magazine Hmm? Coaches used to live up in this piece, son. Kevin Ollie got a shape-up right there from Pop's. Pitino, too. Stylin' and profilin', that's my work. See what I'm sayin'? Yeah? Tell him.

LUKE: For real? Doc Rivers, uh, call you yet, Shameek? [chuckling]

POP: Whoa, all right. Play nice.

LUKE: You can't even afford a haircut.

SHAMEEK: Hey, you know what? - I'm about sick and tired of...

LUKE: What? Hmm? You sick and tired of what?

SHAMEEK: About sick and tired of the Knicks losin' all the time, man! You got some hair, too, right there.

LUKE: I'm not finished.

SHAMEEK: Yes, you are.

Patty enters the shop

POP: Hey, Counselor.

PATTY: Aw, don't jinx me, Pop. I haven't even passed the bar yet.

POP: Oh, you will.

PATTY:  Lonnie, you got Kumon tonight. Let's go.

POP: Come on, boy, you heard your mama. Let's get moving.

PATTY: Don't make me repeat myself. Hey, Luke. What time you get off?

PATTY: I got another job I go to right after I leave this one.

PATTY: Black man working. Ain't nothing wrong with that. Well, we should at least try to get some coffee some time. Maybe you'll need a lawyer one day.

LUKE: Hopefully, you'll have some cards by then.

POP: Hey. Be sure and tell Bessie I said hey.

PATTY: I will.

POP: Mmm-hmm.

SHAMEEK: How's a woman that fine with a briefcase gonna throw it at a brother with a broom?

FISH: That's what you don't get, youngin. Either you have it or you don't.

SHAMEEK: Oh, I know I got it.
Shit.

POP: Whoa, whoa. See the words right there on the wall. Pay up.

SHAMEEK: Come on, Pop.

Luke throws Patty's number under the washing machine

POP: Huh, there you go again. I shook everything else after I got out. Cigarettes, paranoia But the pacing?  I do it, too. Reva again?

LUKE: Reva always.

POP: Look, it's been long enough. Give Patty a call. She's a good woman.

LUKE: I don't drink coffee much. I don't think she does either.

POP: Like she said, ""Ain't nothing wrong with that.""

LUKE: When I'm ready, I'm ready.

POP: But you'll want a cup of something hot and dark sooner or later Mr. Bulletproof.

LUKE: There you go with the nicknames, Pop.

POP: You said your rebound chick took a shotgun at point-blank range pointed it under your chin, and pulled the trigger.

LUKE: I still get the occasional headache.

LUKE: Not a problem for you, Power Man.

Luke lifts up the washing machine with one hand to retrieve Patty's number.

POP: I love it when you do stuff like that. You should be out there helping people, that's all, like them other fellas downtown.

LUKE: Reva used to say the same thing.

POP: Yeah, well, she was right. You don't ever think about all the people you could help? You should be more ambitious.

LUKE: What if my ambition is to sweep hair wash dishes and be left the hell alone?

POP: Well, that would be a waste.

LUKE: You think I asked for any of this? I was framed, beaten and put in some tank like an exotic fish.
Came out with abilities.

POP: Saved your life.

LUKE: More like ruined it. Reva's dead. I'm a fugitive.

POP: So? Take my advice, brother. The past is the past. And the only direction in life that matters is forward. Never backwards.

LUKE: I'm just living my life day to day.

THE BACK OF THE BARBERSHOP, EVENING

Luke bumps into Chico and knocks him down, revealing Chico's handgun.

CHICO:  Why don't you watch where you going, man?

LUKE: What's the gun for, Chico?

CHICO: Is your name Wilfredo Diaz? 'Cause he walked out on me and moms when I was nine. I ain't need a daddy then and I don't need one now.

Chico gets in a car with the waiting Shameek.

SHAMEEK: Let's get this money.

CHICO: Yeah.

Luke checks the time and rushes to to the front of the shop.

LUKE: Hey, Pop, I gotta go. I'm runnin' late.

POP: Hey. Look, if I wasn't paying you in cash, I could be paying you more. You wouldn't have to be workin' two jobs.

LUKE: I gotta do what I gotta do Always forward.

POP: Forward.
Always.
[sighs] [indistinct chatter] [vendor]

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Luke Cage walks to his other job.

STREET VENDOR: Hey, yo, my man, my man. All HD.Got it right here. Blu-ray, too, 'cause I'm nice like that. Tony Stark, the big blonde dude with the hammer, the old dude with the shield, the green monster, and I don't mean Fenway. You can't get better raw footage of the incident anywhere else than right here.

OLLIE: Hey, Luke.

LUKE: Every time.

OLLIE: It's the bleach. I can smell it from around the corner! Pop has got you washing towels again, huh? Yeah, I took a New Yorker off the top for you. Can't tell you what's on the cover, though. Hey, I hope you got Connie's rent money. She's on the warpath.

LUKE: Thanks, Ollie.

OLLIE: Mmm-hmm.

Luke tries to slip around Genghis Connie's unnoticed, but Connie catches him as he rounds the corner.

CONNIE: Ten days late, Mr.
Cage. I need my rent money.

LUKE: Here.

CONNIE: I count $300. Not enough.

LUKE: Let me go to work and get the rest.

CONNIE: Tonight.

HARLEM'S PARADISE

Raphael Saadiq performing ""Good Man"" in the lush and crowded club. Cottonmouth watches from VIP.

NATE: I need a favor. Short one bartender. Dante's sick.

LUKE: You got the cash you promised me?

NATE: End of the week.

LUKE: Come on, Nate.

NATE: You can keep all your tips out there, okay? When was the last time you made drinks?

LUKE: I know the drill.

NATE: Okay, okay. Clean up. Put a shirt and jacket on. Mr. Stokes has standards.

LUKE: Though you can't tell by what he pays.

NATE: Excuse me?

VIP

MARIAH DILLARD: Raphael Saadiq. He's as good live as you said he was.

COTTONMOUTH: Even better...So you're not impressed by all this?

MARIAH: I've always been proud of you.

COTTONMOUTH: This place was a roach trap by the time Mama Mabel died. Now look at it. Harlem's Paradise. May as well be the new Cotton Club.

MARIAH: Then I shouldn't be up in here tonight.

COTTONMOUTH: Well Madam Councilwoman, Colon's Gym is ready to make a sizable donation to my pocket and your real estate project. Sometimes you need a face-to-face.

MARIAH: ""Colon's Gym""? Is that what that two-bit drug dealer is puttin' on his tax returns? Why do you even waste time with him? Politics is where the power is, Cornell. Forget about all this other noise.

COTTONMOUTH: My noise keeps you flush. All that ""keep Harlem black"" rack-a-bully-ack might get you re-elected.

MARIAH: Damn skippy.

COTTONMOUTH: But when the smoke clears it's niggas like me that let you hold on to what you got.

MARIAH: You know I despise that word.

COTTONMOUTH: I know. It's easy to underestimate a nigga.
They never see you coming.

DOWNSTAIRS AT THE BAR

LUKE: What's that?

MISTY KNIGHT: It's a cosmo. Your jacket's a little small.

LUKE: So is your dress.

MISTY: Touché.

VIP

DOMINGO: Cornell, my man.

COTTONMOUTH: Champagne. All right.

DOMINGO: Councilwoman.

MARIAH: What are you two celebrating?

COTTONMOUTH: Success. Partnership that should have happened a long time ago, had my uncle and your brother had their way.

DOMINGO: Uncle Pete was good people. Salvador really liked Pete.

DOWNSTAIRS

LUKE: Anytime...Lookin' for somethin'?

MISTY: No. Saadiq's still got it. Stone Rollin' was a dope album.

LUKE: ""Album""? Now I know you're an old head.

MISTY: You ain't no spring chicken neither, sucker.

LUKE: Touché.

VIP

DOMINGO: All right. So let me get this straight. I give your cousin a contribution and it's like a get out of jail free card for me, right?

COTTONMOUTH: That's something to celebrate.

MARIAH: No, I don't do that.

DOMINGO: See, me I celebrate when things are finished.
Not when it's just starting.

MARIAH: Listen to him. This is nothing to celebrate. You saw what happened to Fisk. You two shouldn't even be seen together let alone having me all up in the Kool-Aid.

COTTONMOUTH: But you're here anyway. Something must be right about it. Otherwise, you wouldn't have fronted me if you didn't agree.

MARIAH: I have no illusions about our family's legacy. But you are now turning legitimate money illegal all over again.

COTTONMOUTH: What's illegal about it? Our product is protected by the Constitution. But you came to me because you trust me, Domingo.

Raphael Saadiq's ""Angel""

COTTONMOUTH: In your business, people need my product like a fish needs water.

MARIAH: He can buy his water anywhere.

COTTONMOUTH: Nah. What I sell is pure. This the kind of shit that could blow a hole in a battleship. But it's light enough to hold in your hand. Trust me, Domingo. You can brighten someone's day permanently with this shit. Top of the line. The crème de la crème. This that grade A, military, Justin Hammer-level shit. A hundred large per case. Ten cases, a cool mil. Wholesale. Brand spanking new. No serial numbers because my connect is nice like that.

Cottonmouth's dialogue is interspersed with video of the deal in question, an exchange money for cases of guns in a junkyard.

DOMINGO: Who's your connect?

COTTONMOUTH: He's real and his inventory runs deep.

DOMINGO: So that's it.

COTTONMOUTH: That's it. Easy-peasy.

MARIAH: Nothing's ever that easy.

DOMINGO: So what happens after they call to confirm?

COTTONMOUTH: Everyone walks away happy. UPS ain't the only brown that delivers.

MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE GUN DEAL

Masked gunmen appear on the scene.

COTTONMOUTH: My man.

The gunmen start shooting and kill all the gangsters as they flee the junkyard. The scene is cut with footage of Saadiq's performance and the applause of the clubgoers.

One of the gunmen takes off his mask and it's Shameek from the barbershop.

SHAMEEK: Yeah, kid. That's what I'm talkin' about. Yeah. Yo, you see this? Damn!

DANTE: Yo! You wasn't supposed to kill nobody, man!

SHAMEEK: I had to make a move, Dante. Shit went left. My bad.

CHICO: Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. God.

SHAMEEK: Shut up, Chico, before I gag you with your panties.

Chico vomits

SHAMEEK: Yo, y'all see this money, B? Yo, this shit is like some Hollywood shit for real.

DANTE: Shameek, what am I gonna do? They're gonna know it was me.

SHAMEEK: B, there's, like, a million dollars right here.

DANTE: Cottonmouth always lookin' down at me at the bar. He's gonna know I'm gone. They gonna know it was a inside job.

SHAMEEK: You right.

Shameek shoots Dante.

CHICO: What'd you do?

SHAMEEK: Yo, shit works. Yo, this shit works, Chico. Dante would have snitched. You see you see how shook he was? Come on, man. I ain't...Ain't no way I'm splitting that shit three ways no how, man.

CHICO: Dante was crew, B. That's Dante!

SHAMEEK: Yo, I made a decision. I'm gonna be rich. Let's go. Let's go! Come on!

THE BAR AT HARLEM'S PARADISE

LUKE: So you're a bench-warmer? Or did you miss the cut?

MISTY: Excuse me?

LUKE: I just figured you were...one of his.

MISTY: One of Cottonmouth's...?

LUKE: I hear he hates that name. Mr. Stokes'...

MISTY: Cottonmouth's...

LUKE: Models.

MISTY: What makes you assume that?

LUKE: You're beautiful. But...

MISTY: But what?

LUKE: You're a little older than he usually likes them.

MISTY: Yeah, you're definitely not getting a tip tonight.

LUKE: But I'm not finished....Dumb men like little girls. Me? I ponder a woman.

MISTY: Why don't you ponder me another cosmo?

CANDACE: Luke.

LUKE: Hey, Candace.

CANDACE: You got promoted?

LUKE: Dante's out sick. You okay?

CANDACE: Table seven wants six bottles of Ace of Spades. I need you to help me carry them up...I don't like being up there by myself.

LUKE: I'm right behind you. Give me a second. Why don't you ponder that 'til I get back.

VIP

Luke brings in the bucket with the champagne. Cottonmouth catches Luke's arm as he's trying to leave.

COTTONMOUTH: You're a big one, eh?

MARIAH: He's wearing a little jacket.

COTTONMOUTH: Haven't seen you behind the bar. Where's Dante?

LUKE: Called in sick, I guess.

COTTONMOUTH: You want a job? I can find something more suitable for a man your size. Better paying, too. You ever carried a gun?

LUKE: No. I'm good. Thanks.

THE SCENE OF THE CRIME

Dante is alone but still alive. He pulls out his phone and makes a call.

VIP

One of Cottonmouth's minions (Tone) gets the call.

TONE: Yeah? Shit. Fuck.

Tone whispers in Cottonmouth's ear.

OUTSIDE HARLEM'S PARADISE, CLOSING TIME

Misty is using her phone, Luke approaches her from behind.

LUKE: You got to walk over to Adam Clayton Powell if you wanna catch the bus....Uber? That's what you were gonna press, right? -

MISTY: What are you? A cop?

LUKE: No. You just look cold. If you're looking for Mr. Stokes, he just left.

MISTY: Who?

LUKE: Black Escalade. Tinted windows.

MISTY: Don't you have somewhere you need to be?

LUKE: Yeah. Home. just got off.

MISTY: Congratulations...You wanna go grab a coffee?

LUKE: I don't like coffee.

MISTY: Neither do I.

LUKE'S APARTMENT

Carnal pleasures.

Cut straight to a scene of a prison, in which an inmate is being beaten by two other inmates. The sound of a cellphone ringing startles Cage out of what turns out to be his nightmare. It's still dark.

When? I'm on my way in.

MISTY: You talk in your sleep.

LUKE: What was I saying?

MISTY: Shades? Comanche?...The job is calling me in.

LUKE: Can I call you later?

MISTY: You'd need my phone number for that...I know where you work. I'll find you.

LUKE: What is it you do again?

Misty bids Luke to zip up her dress. She's clearly stalling in order to prepare a lie.

MISTY: I'm an auditor.

LUKE: What's that?

MISTY: Basically, I look at the financial books. Make sure everything's on the up and up.

LUKE: And you need a short dress for that?

MISTY: Sometimes you got to blend in.

LUKE: Impossible. You stand out in any room you're in.

They kiss, she pushes him away and leaves. He watches her cross the street and climb into the back of a waiting car.

THE SCENE OF THE CRIME, NOW A CRIME SCENE. DAYTIME

Detective Rafael Scarfe peers at one of the many dead bodies

UNIFORM COP: Dominicans? Cubans? Puerto Ricans.

SCARFE: Thought that parade was last week.

UNIFORM: Who can keep track?

They pause to stand over Dante's body, cellphone sitting by his hand.

UNIFORM: Who do you think this guy was trying to call?

Misty arrives at the scene in a suit, with a badge on her lapel. She was a cop all along!

MISTY: Ghostbusters.

They all chuckle.

MISTY: He can laugh. You can't. Hey, Bailey. How you doing?

MARK BAILEY: It's another beautiful day at the office. What's not to love?

MISTY: Don't you start singing show tunes on me. [looks at the body] Oh, shit. Dante Chapman.

SCARFE: You know him?

MISTY: I know his mama.

COTTONMOUTH'S OFFICE AT HARLEM'S PARADISE

COTTONMOUTH (on the phone): Of course it wasn't a inside job...We had people die, too...Look I don't have the stuff...Hmm....We need to talk about this in person, my word is still my bond...Hello?

TONE: That's Domingo? Yo, what's up?

COTTONMOUTH: It's above your pay grade.

TONE: What?

Shades enters the office.

SHADES: Tell your man what's going on, Cornell. Nice digs. Even nicer than when Mama Mabel ran it.

COTTONMOUTH: Shades. When'd you come home?

SHADES: Ooh, a while ago. Seagate wasn't shit.

COTTONMOUTH: Hmm. So what can I do for you?

SHADES: It's the other way around. Y'all got hit last night. That expensive, exclusive, hard-to-get hardware that Diamondback gave you is in a police evidence lockup. And the money that Domingo and his crew were supposed to give you is gone. I'm with Diamondback now. You knew that, right?

COTTONMOUTH: Well, tell Diamondback, it's about time...
SHADES: Uh-uh. Diamondback tells you.

COTTONMOUTH: I'm his number one seller.

SHADES: I ain't here to spank you. But I do need to look you in your eyes (he takes off his shades) Was it an inside job?

COTTONMOUTH: No. Hell no. I needed that money, too. It took forever to build up that kind of trust.

SHADES: We're here to get you back on your feet. Whatever you need.

TONE: Who is ""we,"" you fake-ass Ray Charles?

SHADES: I got your back, B. Just like back in the day.

COTTONMOUTH: Forget about back in the day. Why is this feeling like a takeover?

SHADES: It's not. If it was you would never even see Diamondback comin'. He wants you to win. How can I help?

OUTSIDE THE BARBERSHOP

Luke finds a page from a tabloid about the junkyard robbery and Dante's death.

POP: Dante was one of my kids. So was Chico. And Shameek, too. Just like those kids playing over there. You know, that's how you get 'em on your side. Sweepin' up hair. Runnin' errands. Lettin' 'em hang out, play video games. Anything is better than what's waiting for them out there on the street. They want a way out but they have too much pride to ask for help. So you gotta Jedi mind-trick them into something.


LUKE: Everyone has a gun. No one has a father.

POP: Ain't that the truth.

LUKE: You sure they did it?

POP: People started callin' me half an hour after it happened. Shameek has always been the spark plug. And Chico a follower. I just can't believe that either one of them would just turn around and kill Dante. You didn't see anything going on with either one of 'em, did you?

LUKE: No. You live and die by your choices.

A BARBECUE IN A PARK

MARIAH: This is Harlem's garden.
That's what's happening here. You are the ones that are gonna keep this community...Where have...? Oh, God. This is Marisol. (Mariah sweeps Marisol around for a hug...at just the right angle for the cameras) Baby, oh my God, known her since she was first born. And here you are up turnin' Harlem around. I'm so proud of you.
Ah! I saw you running for the bus this mornin'. All right, darling.
I'm happy you made it, darling. Uh-uh, uh-uh, cut him off at three. I know this young brother. He'll eat five hamburgers. I've seen you do it.

Mariah steps away from the food line and gets a squirt of hand sanitizer from a waiting aide.

A TV INTERVIEW IN FRONT OF THE CRISPUS ATTUCKS COMPLEX

Mariah is talking to the reporter, but she notices Cottonmouth and his minions lurking nearby.

MARIAH: Now, Harlem is a community that welcomes everyone. All people. But at the same time, since the days of Langston Hughes, Malcolm X, Zora Neale Hurston, Duke Ellington, Harlem has been the jewel of black America. It's a perpetual symbol of of hope and prosperity and excellence. For black lives to matter, black history and black ownership must also matter. Now, my multifaceted plan for the Crispus Attucks Complex is just yet another way to bring hope to a new generation, to incubate the kind of innovation and creativity and progress that Harlem's famous for.

MEGAN: Thank you again for your time, Madam Councilwoman.

MARIAH: Oh, Megan, you're always welcome in Harlem.

MEGAN: All right.

MARIAH: All right, darling...Y'all need to fall the hell back.

COTTONMOUTH: Zip, give her some space.

MARIAH: I don't like the thugs.

COTTONMOUTH: You need them for security.

MARIAH: they scare people.

COTTONMOUTH:They pass out flyers, get contributions, tributes. (Jamaican accent) Just like in Jamaica, you know?

MARIAH: Yeah, well, we ain't Jamaican, Cornell. You shouldn't be here. We don't need to be photographed together.

COTTONMOUTH: Why? You ashamed of me? That hurts, Mariah.

MARIAH (to her nearby aide): Tony. Will you give us a moment?...I need the money you promised me ASAP.

COTTONMOUTH: Now you want the money?

MARIAH: I used federal grant and tax-deductible donation money to complete construction on your club and to facilitate that meticulous deal that just fell apart. I don't get the money, I'm facing an audit. We all go to jail.

COTTONMOUTH: It'll be there.

MARIAH: What happened at the junkyard last night? And who's the dude in the sunglasses behind you? Is he after the money, too?

COTTONMOUTH: Either you want the details, cuz, or you don't. That's what I thought...

Mariah walks away, and Cottonmouth goes over to Tone and Shades

COTTONMOUTH: What's the word?

TONE: Confirmation of what Dante told us while he was dying. His friends, the one that play on your summer league team at the Rucker, jacked your shit. Shameek and Chico.

SHADES: Any bites yet?

TONE: No.

COTTONMOUTH: Double down. Twenty large to find those fools.

A VERY RED STRIP CLUB/DEN OF INIQUITY

Shameek is in a private room spanking Passion with a wad of bills.

STRIPPER: Tone, Passion is twerking for him right now. He ain't going nowhere soon, not with all that ass in his face. You want me to keep him here, you need to pay me.

OUTSIDE GENGHIS CONNIE'S

Luke catches Connie's eye and she clearly wants her rent. Outside the shop Zip and a few other of Cottonmouth's guys are loitering by their car.

ZIP: Hey, yo, my man. You know what time it is?

LUKE: 8:15.

Zip hands him a ""New Harlem Renaissance"" flyer

ZIP: Stay Harlem. Stay black.

COTTONMOUTH'S OFFICE AT HARLEM'S PARADISE

Cottonmouth plays sad jazz music while two scantily clad women look on.

THE KITCHEN OF HARLEM'S PARADISE

Luke sees Nate and catches his arm.

LUKE: Hey, man.

NATE: Watch your hands.

LUKE: You need to pay me.

NATE: I'm paying you under the table, which means I'll pay you whenever I goddamn feel like it.

Tone escorts Shameek in through the kitchen door.

TONE: What you worried about?

SHAMEEk: I'm not worried. I just never met Cottonmouth before, that's all.

TONE: Mr. Stokes. Mr. Stokes. That's important. Never Cottonmouth.

SHAMEEK: All right, okay, my bad.

TONE: After what happened with Dante, we circling the wagons. They after us, B.

SHAMEEK: Who?

TONE: Nigga, it don't matter who. Mr. Stokes wanted me to check on you personally.

Shameek catches Luke staring him down, lingers a moment before leaving the kitchen.

TONE: Yo, what you doin'? Come on.

Luke has a moment of indecision, then takes his apron off and makes to leave the kitchen. However, he freezes up when he sees Shades come in. A quick flashback to his prison nightmare confirms for us that this the same person and they knew each other at Seagate Prison. Luke lowers his head as Shades walks by him without a glance.

LUKE: Shades.

Luke heads quickly to a different exit.

COTTONMOUTH'S OFFICE

COTTONMOUTH: You like my Biggie photo? Me, too. You know what draws your eye when you look at that? The crown. Wanna know why? Huh? 'Cause everybody wants to be the king.

Cottonmouth slaps Shameek across the face, but the camera stays on Cottonmouth's face.

COTTONMOUTH: I slapped you like a little bitch. I'm not the kind of man to use a closed fist on a woman. Where's my money?

SHAMEEK (off-camera): I...I didn't...

COTTONMOUTH: Uh-uh. Only thing worse than a thief is a damn liar.

Cottonmouth slaps Shameek several more times

COTTONMOUTH: Where's...my...money? Hmm? You left Dante alive. He called Tone. And with his dying words, gave up you and your homeboy. We got your money. Now you're gonna tell us where Chico is so we can get the rest.

Shameek spits at Cottonmouth.

COTTONMOUTH: Yeah. Thank you. Now I can hit you like a man.

Cottonmouth drags Shameek to the floor and punches him over and over, until Cottonmouth's own face is splattered with blood. Tone and Shades look on with varying levels of discomfort.

COTTONMOUTH: Get his ass out of here. And go fetch my money.

LUKE'S APARTMENT

Luke is pacing his bedroom and packing a bag.

LUKE: He didn't recognize you.

A prominent shot of the books on Luke's bed.

Flashback to group therapy at Seagate, with Reva leading.

REVA: Loneliness never goes away, especially in places like Seagate. If you don't make attempts to befriend someone loneliness is guaranteed to eat you alive.

Cut to Luke taking out of the photo of Reva from his bathroom cabinet

LUKE: I'm clear. I'm focused. I promise, baby I'm ready.

EXT. OF MOUNT OLIVET BAPTIST CHURCH, A CRIME SCENE

This is where they dumped Shameek's body.

SCARFE: Shameek Smith, based on what they found in his pockets. We'll need dental to confirm ID. His face is jacked.

MISTY: Mmm. They definitely dumped him here. They got him somewhere else.

SCARFE: Mmm. Looks like he got hit by a truck.

MISTY: Yeah. A truck with two fists. You know, Benjamin Franklin said, ""The only way that three people can keep a secret is if two of 'em are dead."" First Dante, now Shameek. Chico's the last man standing.

SCARFE: Benjamin Franklin Didn't he electrocute himself flying a kite in a rainstorm? I wouldn't base any theories on that fool.

MISTY: Benjamin Franklin is on the $100 bill, Scarfe.

SCARFE: So? He wasn't a president.

MISTY: That's even more impressive. Come on, give the man some credit.

SCARFE: Well. So you think Chico did this to Shameek?

MISTY: Chico is what? A buck 50 soaking wet? But we won't know for sure until we find him.

SCARFE: You said Dante wasn't bartendin' the night you were at the club.

MISTY: No.

SCARFE: Well, did you talk to the guy that replaced him that night?

MISTY: I barely talked to the guy. I mean all I did was order drinks.

SCARFE: Well, maybe there's some pattern, somethin' we're missin'. We need to go talk to that guy.

MISTY: That sounds like a complete waste of time.

SCARFE: That's entirely possible. But it's worth a shot.

MISTY: All right.

Zip and his crew are smashing up the restaurant.

KOKO: You've been in this country for how long? And you still can't speak English?

JIN LIN: My English is just fine.

SUGAR: Show Mariah Dillard some love. Contribute and we'll go away.
It's a family thing.

JIN LIN: I own this restaurant. My father owned this building. Tell Mariah Dillard I am not contributing to her complex. We voted for her and gave her money before. And I respect Mr. Stokes. But no. No more. I can't.

Luke enters the restaurant unnoticed.

ZIP: Give us the money.

LUKE: Yo I don't like your tone.

ZIP: Excuse me?

LUKE: You're being disrespectful. It's unnecessary.

Zip's crew laughs uproariously.

KOKO: You need to step off, Mayweather. I mean, what you think you gonna do, man?

SUGAR: I think he think he gonna bring it.

LUKE: I can. Not the way I want to. I'd kill you.

ZIP:Ooh. I like this cat. Yo, Amos.

AFOREMENTIONED AMOS: What up?

ZIP: Show the man what you famous for.

Amos goes to punch Luke straight in the face. Luke stands to take it, and Amos's fist and wrist bones crumple up and stick out of his skin like he just punched a steel wall full force. In slow motion, obviously. The rest of Zip's crew goes for him with guns, baseball bats, etc. Luke totally trashes them and the restaurant. Eventually Sugar is the last man standing.

LUKE: You want some?

SUGAR: I don't even like these niggas, man.

Sugar hightails it out of the restaurant, and Luke does not stop him.

LUKE:I'm sorry about your window.

Connie reaches into the register and takes out money. She offers it to Luke.

CONNIE: Here.

LUKE: For what?

CONNIE: For you.

LUKE: Ma'am, I'm the one who owes you money.

JIN: You made things worse. They'll come back again.

CONNIE: We want to hire you.

LUKE: I'm not for hire.

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyer dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
But I know a place where we can go
That's still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in th4e wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the ned of the innocence
O'beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
Bt I know a place where we can go
And was a away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocnece
Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look

Love drives you, to the point of no return
Love lies, love burns

Like a toy, he tore it all apart
In her mind, she'll never love again

She stops and says a little prayer
Oh Mama don't you cry

Say a prayer for me
Stay in the air for me
You say you care for me and you're staying there for me
In the air, I will be there shortly
Every prayer is my airport and tears are the leer for me
The golden sun glares for me
Somewhere for me someone stares for me
Just zones out seeing nothing but the thoughts I project
Lost in my steps such tears are hard to bear for me
But as I walk the Led Zepplin paved steps
My destination may take your breath away yes
Keep your balance don't [fall from heaven]
Though it's a long walk it ain't far from [heaven]
Angels are the stars
I'm Batman in the dark night
'cuz that man has to stand with his dark plight
But a pink blur C-H illuminates the sky
Using the stars, connect the dots
My heart's right

[Hook]
If I could be a fly on the wall
To hear what you really think about me
I wouldn't be flying at all
Believe what you believe about me
I just live how I live
Forget how I live
My angels come back and hold me down
Then my angels come back and lift me up
And remind me that I do deserve the crown

[Verse 2]
This ain't a love song
This is my way of saying what's wrong
With people who believe that all the love's gone
People would rather greenback so much that their heart is black
Romance is something for them to scream
But that ain't what the issue is
Even angels fear love when they don't know what their mission is
I wonder if God has to tell 'em to chill
Cause they'd still be in heaven even if they were never revealed
If at one point you'd end up falling
You wouldn't even be the one that God would be calling
Fall is for Autumn
The season changed
Replenished but finished like Autumn leaves and rain
Some would repeat the degrees of pain
While the rest just spring from pain
To receive the wings of fame
So chill like the season ignored
Freezing for sure cause we don't wanna grieve anymore

If I could be a fly on the wall
To hear what you really think about me
I wouldn't be flying at all
Believe what you believe about me

And remind me that I do deserve the crown

[Verse 3]
Angels have free will too
They not God's yes people
Forced to say ""You got it will do!""
They can defy but they know their lives
Is a sure-fire way to fall away from the sky
So as real as I am in my songs
I am a man that can stand to say damn it I'm wrong
It's being real
People feel I need to chill
Burn some weed drink some tea
And have some pizza, still
I sit still
Not me, I mean the word ""still""
On an earthquake, see how the world feels
And when it comes back speechless
I will ask you to tell me every last one of your secrets
I reach in my soul to fight my inner insecurities
And we both get strong with each beating
Putting together all the pieces, believe it
I don't want eternal happiness, I need it

If I could be a fly on the wall

You can't just leave me
To face life on my own
I know you don't love me no more
I knew this day it would come
Even when it cuts so deep
It's true I still want you
But the harder I try
The more I seem to lose

I don't want a lover
I just need a friend
I've had time to recover
Now that I know it wasn't love

It's always a different story
When it's me who's in the wrong
But you can't have it all
Cause I'm the one who's strong
I've already been burnt before
Once but never again

Trusts the journey to new heights

Should we ever be apart

175,Turned Away,"Turned away, turned away
Turned away, turned away
From love

Too many times I feel
We are losing time once shared
And only when you're in ecstasy
You seem to really care

Didn't you say not to worry
I can only speak for myself
How do you think that I'm happy, baby
With a love like mine
Locked up on a shelf

Remember my love had a place
It was a part of the game
And just when I went all the way
I'm in too deep
Girl, you made the choice
And sent away

(Turned away)
When you should've been giving
(Turned away) oh
As I started believing
(Turned away)
Just as I was living
(Turned away from love)

I discovered you were untrue
So unfortunate for you
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
I only gave you the best
I ever had to you

Don't let sympathy show her face
Girl, let's not pretend
I'm no longer in this race
You've got your space
Still it hurts me that you

(Turned away)
When you should've been giving
(Turned away) oh
As I started believing
(Turned away)
Just as I was living

176,Need A Little Taste Of Love,"Hey mister, walkin' with the blues
Hey sister, payin' heavy dues
Havin' troubles, and it ain't so hard to find
When you're ridin' double, and you're runnin' out of time

No need to feel, that you lack the spirit
Within the body, but it's in the soul
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back
Need a little taste of love

Hey mister, tell me how long has it been
Hey sister, so how could you pretend
Why keep the sorrow, where it don't belong
Well come tomorrow, oh help me sing the song

No need to feel, that you lack the spirit
Within the body, but it's in the soul
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back

177,Lay Down Your Arms,"[Chorus:]
Come to the station
Jump from the train
March at the double
Down lover's lane
Then in the glen
Where the roses entwine
Lay down your arms
(Lay down your arms)
Lay down your arms
And surrender to mine

My sweetheart is a soldier
As handsome as can be
But suddenly they sent him
Away across the sea

So patiently I waited
Until his leave was due
Then wrote and said, my darling
I'll tell you what to do

[Repeat Chorus]
A soldier is a soldier
And when he's on parade
An order is an order
And has to be obeyed

You've got to do your duty
Wherever you may be
And now you're under orders
To hurry home to me

[Repeat Chorus]
The girl who loves a soldier
Is either sad or gay
'Cause first of all he's with her
And then he's far away

But soldiers have their duty
To answer to the call
And that is why I'm calling
The loudest of them all

[Repeat Chorus]
Lay down your arms
And surrender to mine
Lay down your arms
And surrender to mine

Lay down your arms
And surrender to mine
Lay down your arms

178,Hey Ladies,"Hey
Hey ladies in the place, I'm callin' out to ya
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery
Date women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out lookin' for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on the bib
Wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of a stealin'
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin'
Your body's on time and your mind is appealin'
Starin' at the cracks up there up on the ceilin'
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwin'
I'm talking to a girl, telling her I'm all-knowing
Well, she's talking to the kid (who? to the kid)
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did

Hey ladies, get funky
All the ladies in the house
The ladies, the ladies

Well, me in the corner with a good-lookin' daughter
I dropped my drawers and said ""Welcome back Kotter""
We was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab
Educated… No, Stupid… Yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James At 15 or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about livin' large
With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty
Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listenin' to my records', a number one sound
Step to the rhythm, step, step to the rhyme
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Tune in, turn on, to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive

Hey ladies, get funky
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
Girls, girls
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
One more time ain't it funky now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
Ain't it funky now

You know that
She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl, it ended in tears
Vincent van Gogh, go and mail that ear
I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'
She said come on over, it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train
Well, take my advice at any price
A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man
Suckin' down pints 'till I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with the Won Ton Ho
Cause I announce, I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls, and big long locks
And beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks
Walkin' high and mighty like she's number one
She thinks she's the passionate one

Hey ladies, get funky
What's that?
Good god
Good god, dance

It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way

All the pain

And its burning brighter tonight
Through the storm and the winds of change

Whatever road that you take leads you back to me
Cause our love is too strong to slip away

Like a river flowing into the ocean
I can feel you coming back to me
Cause our love is like a sacred emotion
And its burning bright for the whole world to see

It won't be long before I hear
That knock on the door, that telephone call
If your journey takes you far away
I'll still catch you when you fall

Love's like a wheel turning round and round
The feeling fades but never dies
There'll never be any question or doubt in my mind
Cause the answer's right there in your eyes

Like a river flowing into the ocean
I can feel you coming back to me
Cause our love is like a sacred emotion
And its burning bright for the whole world to see

I wake up in the morning
The first sound that I hear
Is that clock radio (Radio) singing in my ear
I make it to the bathroom to brush my teeth
To that big city big beat
Jump into the shower, bring my box along
'Cause I know all the words to all the songs
Dj stops the music to announce the time
Time has come today

Grabbed my coat and grabbed my hat
Made my train in seconds flat
All the time I'm listening to my radio

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
Because you know the beat goes on
They'll be dancing in the streets
Because the radio is on

My whole life long has been one big song
But all my parents ever said was ""Turn it down""
Even with my homework blasting out the cool jerk
Living for the latest sound
And every special event, has a particular tune
That's the way that I remember everything I do
My first romance ooh we used to dance to the man with the Blue Suede shoes

From the eastside to the westside
Uptown funk and downtown soul
I go downtown and I'm listening to my radio

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
Because you know the beat goes on
They'll be dancing in the streets
Because the radio is on

Radio! Radio

Well you can't sit out, when the air waves howl
It's been that way since the Wolfman growled
Jitterbug, Twist, Watussi too, the swim, the pony and the boogalo
And while the sounds have changed, the radio still rules
Now we moondance down to electric avenue
Breakin, snakin', doing the worm, New York radio makes the world turn

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
Because you know the beat goes on
They'll be dancing in the streets
Because the radio is on

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
Because you know the beat goes on
They'll be dancing in the streets

'cos I always led a life of my own
Never waited for the ring of the 'phone
Never had anyone here
When I got home
But love's about to change my heart

I'm waiting for the doorbell to chime
When I always lived one day at a time
I thought that I was getting on fine
Never felt I was alone
'til you change your mind
Love's about to change my heart

Could a day be so long
When I always felt secure and so strong
And all the time as I went along
Never thought I would desire
So much to belong
Love's about to change my heart
Love's about to change my heart, ooh

Never ever thought the sky was so blue
Never ever thought I'd feel so new
Always thought I'd know what to do
But I guess I wasn't counting on you

What did I know
I always felt so much on control
I thought I'd make it all on my own
Never thought I would forget
All I have known

Love's about to change my heart
Love's about to change, change, change

187,Headed For A Heartbreak,"Morning came and I was on my way, when you reminded me
I had too soon forgotten, it was you who set me free
Yeah you were here when I came and you'll be here when I'm gone
So don't be waiting for love, cause I'll be waiting to ramble on
Headed for a heartbreak, headed for a heartbreak
Darling don't wait up for me, tonight I won't be home
You've become a stranger, I just got to be alone
Don't need nobody on my side to dull the blade I'm on
So don't be waiting for love, cause I'll be waiting to ramble on
Headed for a heartbreak, headed for a heartbreak, headed for a heartbreak
It's no mistake, don't you think I can feel the pain
I walk away to live again

188,Forget Me Not,"[Verse 1]
Stacy, I'd like to take you to a movie
In a world without a death wish
On a night under the fireworks in heaven
Oh but Stacy
Baby, you can't take me anywhere
Because I get a lot of low downs
So just put me in the cold ground and visit
Oh, but what if
What if my soul was still trembling?

[Chorus]
Would you put your black dress on and visit my bones?
And bring my Football top and a scarf for the cold
Playing melancholy songs that somehow made us
Feel a whole lot better
While I waited on the kingdom come and the trumpet blow
In the cold, hard ground missing letters you wrote
Would I get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?
Or would you just go on?

[Verse 2]
Stacy, I never thought I'd miss the small talk
I never knew the gift the day was
I just used to hear the time clock
Whistle stop
Sleep and get back up again
Stacy, I never thought I'd miss the hard love
I wish I took the time to miss you
While we were sitting only right there under heaven
Oh, but what if
What if my soul was still trembling?

[Chorus]
Would you put your black dress on and visit my bones?
And bring my Football top and a scarf for the cold
Playing melancholy songs that somehow made us
Feel a whole lot better
Well, I waited on the kingdom come and the trumpet blow
In the cold, hard ground there's some letters you wrote
Would I get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?
Or would you just go on?

[Bridge]
Could you promise me something if you find someone?
That you'll forget me not
Never feel too much
Even if they do all the things that I couldn't do for you
And I'll promise you something if I find someone
That I'll forget you not
Never feel too much
Even if they do all the things that I couldn't do for you
Oh, but what if
What if your soul was still trembling?

[Chorus]
And I would put my black suit on and visit your bones
And bring your Football top and a play that you wrote
And an English song by a band that you love
Here comes the sun, little darling
And the kingdom come and the trumpet blow
In the cold, hard ground there's some letters you wrote
Would you get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?
Or would you just go on?

[Chorus]
Would you put your black dress on and visit my bones?
And bring my Football top and a scarf for the cold
(Please forget me not)

I told the world that you were down on your luck

You were one of a kind
One who'd never give in

Or seen the scars you wear
Did anyone speak up when you fell
Does anybody care

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
Shine again little fighter
And dont let 'em end the things you do

And you were one with a cause
And a reason to be
You were a fighter for peace on this earth

And you were never afraid
You put your life on the line
And you were always alone out on the sea

Without a weapon in your hand
You came to fight a war
They took your life but didn't know
That you would never die

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
Shine again little fighter
And don't 'em end things you do

Are you feelin alright?
Cause I care, care

Run along little fighter
Oh cause I was there beside you
Never stop believing, so rise
Rise
RISE!

Bitch, I'm Rastafarian, no arguin'
Rich as fuck, could drive whatever car I'm in
I fucked a ho named Car-a-men
She wore the finest gar-a-ments
My type, we drank enough to stumble out the bar again
And she puked all on my cardigan
I swore I’d never share my heart again
Cause all that’s left is fragments of a memory
Now madness is my enemy
A little bit of magic makes a tragedy
The makings of my sanity, I’m managing, I know my family mad at me
I smashed the game and picked the pieces up and hide away in London
‘Till my fucking visa's up, binge-eatin' Reese cups
I’m smothered in that chocolate (Hey!)
Your bitch say I’m a prophet (Hey!)
I got her chakra’s open (Hey!)
I did it for no profit (Umm)

Himself, not what you read or write
Write is wrong when hype is written

Not the false disguise of show-biz

I'll take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers cause I always get by
Some fast talkin' jerk for a dollar wiped the smile off my face
I'm drivin' all night
Just to keep the rat in the race

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

Sometimes I feel so old
Got my lights burnin' bright
But I'm lookin' pretty sold
Sometimes I feel so cold
So cold
Let's go

Got to get on home
My gypsy road can't take me home
My gypsy road can't take me home, t-t-take me

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light

201,Lay Your Hands On Me,"[Chorus]
Lay your hands on me
While I'm bleeding dry
Break on through blue skies
I'll take you higher

[Verse 1]
Caught up in circles
All dreams and bright lights
Wait, I'm here always
Brighter than sunshine
I fly
Fly out
Fly out
To your heart
Fly out
Fly out

[Chorus]
Lay your hands on me
Stay close by my side
Drive me so crazy
Moonlight and star shine

[Verse 2]
Faded into the setting sun
I'll see you again I'll carry on
Feeling like I'm floating leaves in the fleeting sky
You can sing that song
Let it go
Move on
Let's go
Way out

202,Closer To Fine,"I'm trying to tell you something about my life
Maybe give me insight between black and white
The best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously, it's only life after all
Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it, I'm crawling on your shore

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
The closer I am to fine

I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a B-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper
And I was free

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
The closer I am to fine

I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
I went in seeking clarity

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
The closer I am to fine

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
The closer I am to fine

We go to the bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival and we stand up for the lookout
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
The closer I am to fine
The closer I am to fine
The closer I am to fine",Sicko,1989,"[86, 76, 55, 52, 55, 60, 66, 74, 85]",9

205,"Wind Beneath My Wings (From ""Beaches"")","Over the island the build-up of clouds continued. A steady current of heated air rose all day from the mountain and was thrust to ten thousand feet; revolving masses of gas piled up the static until the air was ready to explode. By early evening the sun had gone and a brassy glare had taken the place of clear daylight. Even the air that pushed in from the sea was hot and held no refreshment. Colors drained from water and trees and pink surfaces of rock, and the white and brown clouds brooded. Nothing prospered but the flies who blackened their lord and made the split guts look like a heap of glistening coal. Even when the vessel broke in Simon’s nose and the blood gushed out they left him alone, preferring the pig’s high flavor. With the running of the blood Simon’s fit passed into the weariness of sleep. He lay in the mat of creepers while the evening advanced and the cannon continued to play. At last he woke and saw dimly the dark earth close by his cheek. Still he did not move but lay there, his face sideways on the earth, his eyes looking dully before him. Then he turned over, drew his feet under him and laid hold of the creepers to pull himself up.

When the creepers shook the flies exploded from the guts with a vicious note and clamped back on again. Simon got to his feet. The light was unearthly. The Lord of the Flies hung on his stick like a black ball. Simon spoke aloud to the clearing.

“What else is there to do?”

Nothing replied. Simon turned away from the open space and crawled through the creepers till he was in the dusk of the forest. He walked drearily between the trunks, his face empty of expression, and the blood was dry round his mouth and chin. Only sometimes as he lifted the ropes of creeper aside and chose his direction from the trend of the land, he
mouthed words that did not reach the air. Presently the creepers festooned the trees less frequently and there was
a scatter of pearly light from the sky down through the trees. This was the backbone of the island, the slightly higher land that lay beneath the mountain where the forest was no longer deep jungle. Here there were wide spaces interspersed with thickets and huge trees and the trend of the ground led him up as the forest opened. He pushed on, staggering sometimes with his weariness but never stopping. The usual brightness was gone from his eyes and he walked with a sort of glum determination like an old man.

A buffet of wind made him stagger and he saw that he was out in the open, on rock, under a brassy sky. He found his legs were weak and his tongue gave him pain all the time. When the wind reached the mountaintop he could see something happen, a flicker of blue stuff against brown clouds. He pushed himself forward and the wind came again, stronger now, cuffing the forest heads till they ducked and roared. Simon saw a humped thing suddenly sit up on the top and look down at him. He hid his face, and toiled on.The flies had found the figure too. The life-like movement would scare them off for a moment so that they made a dark cloud round the head. Then as the blue material of the parachute collapsed the corpulent figure would bow forward, sighing, and the flies settle once more.

Simon felt his knees smack the rock. He crawled forward and soon he understood. The tangle of lines showed him the mechanics of this parody; he examined the white nasal bones, the teeth, the colors of corruption. He saw how pitilessly the layers of rubber and canvas held together the poor body that should be rotting away. Then the wind blew again and the figure lifted, bowed, and breathed foully at him. Simon knelt on all fours and was sick till his stomach was empty. Then he took the lines in his hands; he freed them from the rocks and the figure from the wind’s indignity. At last he turned away and looked down at the beaches. The fire by the platform appeared to be out, or at least making no smoke. Further along the beach, beyond the little river and near a great slab of rock, a
thin trickle of smoke was climbing into the sky. Simon, forgetful of the flies, shaded his eyes with both hands and peered at the smoke. Even at that distance it was possible to see that most of the boys—perhaps all of the boys—were there. So they had shifted camp then, away from the beast. As Simon thought this, he turned to the poor broken thing that sat stinking by his side. The beast was harmless and horrible; and the news must reach the others as soon as possible. He started down the mountain and his legs gave beneath him. Even with great care the best he could do was a stagger.

“Bathing,” said Ralph, “that’s the only thing to do.” Piggy was inspecting the looming-sky through his glass. “I don’t like them clouds. Remember how it rained just after we landed?” “Going to rain again.” Ralph dived into the pool. A couple of littluns were playing at the edge, trying to extract comfort from a wetness warmer than blood. Piggy took off his glasses, stepped primly into the water and then put them on again. Ralph came to the surface and squirted a jet of water at him.

“Mind my specs,” said Piggy. “If I get water on the glass I got to get out and clean ’em.”

Ralph squirted again and missed. He laughed at Piggy, expecting him to retire meekly as usual and in pained silence. Instead, Piggy beat the water with his hands. “Stop it!” he shouted.

“D’you hear?” Furiously he drove the water into Ralph’s face.

“All right, all right,” said Ralph. “Keep your hair on.” Piggy stopped beating the water.

“I got a pain in my head. I wish the air was cooler.”

“I wish the rain would come.”

“I wish we could go home.” Piggy lay back against the sloping sand side of the pool. His stomach protruded and the water dried on it. Ralph squinted up at the sky. One could guess at the movement of the sun by the progress of a light patch among the clouds. He knelt in the water and looked round.

“Where’s everybody?” Piggy sat up.

“P’raps they’re lying in the shelter.”

“Where’s Samneric?”

“And Bill?” Piggy pointed beyond the platform.

“That’s where they’ve gone. Jack’s party.”

“Let them go,” said Ralph, uneasily, “I don’t care.”

“Just for some meat—”

“And for hunting,” said Ralph, wisely, “and for pretending to be a tribe, and putting on war-paint.”

Piggy stirred the sand under water and did not look at Ralph. “P’raps we ought to go too.” Ralph looked at him quickly and Piggy blushed. “I mean—to make sure nothing happens.”

Ralph squirted water again. Long before Ralph and Piggy came up with Jack’s lot, they could hear the party. There was a stretch of grass in a place where the palms left a wide band of turf between the forest and the shore. Just one step down from the edge of the turf was the white, blown sand of above high water, warm, dry, trodden. Below that again was a rock that stretched away toward the lagoon. Beyond was a short stretch of sand and then the edge of the water. A fire burned on the rock and fat dripped from the roasting pigmeat into the invisible flames. All the boys of the island, except Piggy, Ralph, Simon, and the two tending the pig, were grouped on the turf. They were laughing, singing, lying, squatting, or standing
on the grass, holding food in their hands. But to judge by the greasy faces, the meat eating was almost done; and some held coconut shells in their hands and were drinking from them. Before the party had started a great log had been dragged into the center of the lawn and Jack, painted and garlanded, sat there like an idol. There were piles of meat on green leaves near him, and fruit, and coconut shells full of drink. Piggy and Ralph came to the edge of the grassy platform; and the boys,
as they noticed them, fell silent one by one till only the boy next to Jack was talking. Then the silence intruded even there and Jack turned where he sat. For a time he looked at them and the crackle of the fire was the loudest noise over the droning of the reef. Ralph looked away; and Sam, thinking that Ralph had turned to him accusingly, put down his gnawed bone with a nervous giggle. Ralph took an uncertain step, pointed to a palm tree, and whispered something inaudible to Piggy; and they both giggled like Sam. Lifting his feet high out of the sand, Ralph started to stroll past. Piggy tried to whistle. At this moment the boys who were cooking at the fire suddenly hauled off a great chunk of meat and ran with it toward the grass. They bumped Piggy, who was burnt, and yelled and danced. Immediately, Ralph and the crowd of boys were united and relieved by a storm of laughter. Piggy once more was the center of social derision so that everyone felt cheerful and normal. Jack stood up and waved his spear.

“Take them some meat.” The boys with the spit gave Ralph and Piggy each succulent chunk. They took the gift, dribbling. So they stood and ate beneath a sky of thunderous brass that rang with the storm-coming.

Jack waved his spear again. “Has everybody eaten as much as they want?” There was still food left, sizzling on the wooden spits, heaped on the green platters. Betrayed by his stomach, Piggy threw a picked bone down on the beach and stooped for more. Jack spoke again, impatiently. “Has everybody eaten as much as they want?” His tone conveyed a warning, given out of the pride of ownership, and the boys ate faster while there was still time. Seeing there was no immediate likelihood of a pause, Jack rose from the log that was his throne and sauntered to the edge of the grass. He looked down from behind his paint at Ralph and Piggy. They moved a little farther off over the sand and Ralph watched the fire as he ate. He noticed, without understanding, how the flames were visible now against the dull light. Evening was come, not with calm beauty but with the threat of violence.

Jack spoke. “Give me a drink.”

Henry brought him a shell and he drank, watching Piggy and Ralph over the jagged rim. Power lay in the brown swell of his forearms: authority sat on his shoulder and chattered in his ear like an ape. “All sit down.”

The boys ranged themselves in rows on the grass before him but Ralph and Piggy stayed a foot lower, standing on the soft sand. Jack ignored them for the moment, turned his mask down to the seated boys and pointed at them with the spear.

“Who’s going to join my tribe?” Ralph made a sudden movement that became a stumble. Some of the boys turned toward him. “I gave you food,” said Jack, “and my hunters will protect you from the beast. Who will join my tribe?”

“I’m chief,” said Ralph, “because you chose me. And we were going to keep the fire going. Now you run after food—”

“You ran yourself!” shouted Jack. “Look at that bone in your hands!”

Ralph went crimson.

“I said you were hunters. That was your job.”
Jack ignored him again.

“Who’ll join my tribe and have fun?”

“I’m chief,” said Ralph tremulously. “And what about the fire? And I’ve got the conch.”

“You haven’t got it with you,” said Jack, sneering. “You left it behind. See, clever? And the conch doesn’t count at this end of the island—”

All at once the thunder struck. Instead of the dull boom there was a point of impact in the explosion.

“The conch counts here too,” said Ralph, “and all over the island.”

“What are you going to do about it then?”
Ralph examined the ranks of boys. There was no help in them and he looked away, confused and sweating. Piggy whispered.

“The fire—rescue.”

“Who’ll join my tribe?”

“I will.”

“Me.”

“I will.”

“I’ll blow the conch,” said Ralph breathlessly, “and call an assembly.”

“We shan’t hear it.”

Piggy touched Ralph’s wrist.

“Come away. There’s going to be trouble. And we’ve had our meat.”

There was a blink of bright light beyond the forest and the thunder exploded again so that a littlun started to whine. Big drops of rain fell among them making individual sounds when they struck.

“Going to be a storm,” said Ralph, “and you’ll have rain like when we dropped here. Who’s clever now? Where are your shelters? What are you going to do about that?”

The hunters were looking uneasily at the sky, flinching from the stroke of the drops. A wave of restlessness set the boys swaying and moving aimlessly. The flickering light became brighter and the blows of the thunder were only just bearable. The littluns began to run about, screaming.

Jack leapt on to the sand.
“Do our dance! Come on! Dance!”

He ran stumbling through the thick sand to the open space of rock beyond the fire. Between the flashes of lightning the air was dark and terrible; and the boys followed him, clamorously. Roger became the pig, grunting and charging at Jack, who side-stepped. The hunters took their spears, the cooks took spits, and the rest clubs of firewood. A circling movement developed and a chant. While Roger mimed the terror of the
pig, the littluns ran and jumped on the outside of the circle. Piggy and Ralph, under the threat of the sky, found themselves eager to take a place in this demented but partly secure society. They were glad to touch the brown backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable.

“Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!”

The movement became regular while the chant lost its first superficial excitement and began to beat like a steady pulse. Roger ceased to be a pig and became a hunter, so that the center of the ring yawned emptily. Some of the littluns started a ring on their own; and the complementary circles went round and round as though repetition would achieve safety
of itself. There was the throb and stamp of a single organism.
The dark sky was shattered by a blue-white scar. An instant later the noise was on them like the blow of a gigantic whip. The chant rose a tone in agony.

“Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!”

Now out of the terror rose another desire, thick, urgent, blind.
“Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!”

Again the blue-white scar jagged above them and the sulphurous explosion beat down. The littluns screamed and blundered about, fleeing from the edge of the forest, and one of them broke the ring of biguns in his terror.
“Him! Him!”
The circle became a horseshoe. A thing was crawling out of the forest.

It came darkly, uncertainly. The shrill screaming that rose before the beast was like a pain. The beast stumbled into the horseshoe.

“Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!”

The blue-white scar was constant, the noise unendurable. Simon was crying out something about a dead man on a hill.

“Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood! Do him in!”
The sticks fell and the mouth of the new circle crunched and screamed. The beast was on its knees in the center, its arms folded over its face. It was crying out against the abominable noise something about a body on the hill. The beast struggled forward, broke the ring and fell over the steep edge of the rock to the sand by the water. At once the crowd surged after it, poured down the rock, leapt on to the beast, screamed, struck,
bit, tore. There were no words, and no movements but the tearing of teeth and claws. Then the clouds opened and let down the rain like a waterfall. The water bounded from the mountain-top, tore leaves and branches from the trees, poured like a cold shower over the struggling heap on the sand.

Presently the heap broke up and figures staggered away. Only the beast lay still, a few yards from the sea. Even in the rain they could see how small a beast it was; and already its blood was staining the sand. Now a great wind blew the rain sideways, cascading the water from the forest trees. On the mountain-top the parachute filled and moved; the figure slid, rose to its feet, spun, swayed down through a vastness of
wet air and trod with ungainly feet the tops of the high trees; falling, still falling, it sank toward the beach and the boys rushed screaming into the darkness. The parachute took the figure forward, furrowing the lagoon, and bumped it over the reef and out to sea. Towards midnight the rain ceased and the clouds drifted away, so that the sky was scattered once more with the incredible lamps of stars. Then the breeze died too and there was no noise save the drip and trickle of water that ran out of clefts and spilled down, leaf by leaf, to the brown
earth of the island. The air was cool, moist, and clear; and presently even the sound of the water was still. The beast lay huddled on the pale beach and the stains spread, inch by inch.
The edge of the lagoon became a streak of phosphorescence which advanced minutely, as the great wave of the tide flowed. The clear water mirrored the clear sky and the angular bright constellations. The line of phosphorescence bulged about the sand grains and little pebbles; it held them each in a dimple of tension, then suddenly accepted them with an
inaudible syllable and moved on.

Along the shoreward edge of the shallows the advancing clearness was full of strange, moonbeam-bodied creatures with fiery eyes. Here and there a larger pebble clung to its own air and was covered with a coat of pearls. The tide swelled in over the rain-pitted sand and smoothed everything with a layer of silver. Now it touched the first of the stains that seeped from the broken body and the creatures made a moving patch of light as they gathered at the edge. The water rose farther and dressed Simon’s coarse hair with brightness. The line of his cheek silvered and the turn of his shoulder became sculptured marble. The strange attendant creatures, with their fiery eyes and trailing vapors, busied themselves
round his head. The body lifted a fraction of an inch from the sand and a bubble of air escaped from the mouth with a wet plop. Then it turned gently in the water. Somewhere over the darkened curve of the world the sun and moon were pulling, and the film of water on the earth planet was held, bulging
slightly on one side while the solid core turned. The great wave of the tide moved farther along the island and the water lifted. Softly, surrounded by a fringe of inquisitive bright creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast constellations, Simon’s dead body moved out toward the open

207,Express Yourself,"[Intro]
Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel

[Chorus]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...

[Chorus]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

That I've got to do what I must do to be a better man
Cause if I was just to act a fool do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed my world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through when the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I must go do what I must do

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
A time, a space, a different place, how perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day you'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry you know I must do what I must do

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross

[Bridge: Stephen Marley] (Mos Def)
Well and it's not easy, Jah knows how I try I try
So don't you get weary (Oh God)
Jah knows how I try, I try

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
And God knows, that life is one big road
With a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the sites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
It's no valley low and it's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shining right through my heart
So my journey must start

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross

209,No More Rhyme,"[Verse 1:]
When the fear sets in
Where the fire burns
Where I find a place
Where there's nowhere to turn
When the evening sings
An eerie song
Longing for the day
You say I'm wrong

You can find your place
But never fit in
And only when you've left
Do you know where you've been
I can see the light
But only when it's gone
You can go on waiting
But only for so long (so long, so long)

[Chorus:]
I know we are right
It's not always clear
Because I've never felt the fear
Can it stay so good forever in time?
I've always felt the rhythm
What happens when there's no more rhyme?

[Verse 2:]
Can we face ourselves
Like we face each other?
We've never felt anything
On our own
I can't wait much longer
To feel any danger
I hope we're not living
For a lifetime alone

[Chorus:]
I know we are right
It's not always clear
Because I've never felt the fear
Can it stay so good forever in time?
I've always felt the rhythm
What happens when there's no more rhyme?

[Bridge:]
Hard to go on
It's like waiting for
The other shoe to drop
I'll never stop believing in you
It's just we never had to struggle
It all came too easy
I hope we felt what we felt from the start
We've never suffered a broken heart
We've been so blinded
By all the best
We never put our love to the test

So I can't see
But when it sets down behind the
Mountain It's gonna be

My first night without you
My first night without you
My first night without you
Oh...without you

I sit here like a fool
Remembering everything
TRhe way we used to talk
The songs that we used to sing
I've got to try and leave
The past behind
But my memory's so good
I think that I'm losing my mind

My first night without you
My first night without you
And I wonder what I'll do
Oh...without you

Will I be able to sleep
Will I lie in my bed and weep
What if i forget
And reach for you
Will i dream about you

On the cover of a magazine

All over the front page news
Better save your ink'.mister

That I'm just another prisoner of love

Talkin' bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin' bout the pride and passion

With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed

Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Or take her out some place I'd be satisfied

Hey, I'm a lovesick son

With one of them Walkman's on her head
She was hot, young, beautiful
And I said to myself
She's destined to be mine

I see her every day
In rush hour or subway, in a grocery store
She don't notice me
I might as well just be a cockroach on the floor
If she belonged to me I'd give her everything

I'd treat her with respect, not just a sex object

Oh, the night that we first met
The moment you looked in my eyes
I never will forget
And I remember
Oh, the first time that we kissed
Remember thinking to myself could it really be like this

And we danced beneath a midnight moon
And I took one look, one look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still

And we moved so sweet, sweet and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And then your arms reached out and held me close
And the night stood still

I still remember
The song they were playing then
And if I close my eyes I swear
That we’re back there again

Do you remember
Oh the way it used to be
We were two hearts on the run
So young and wild and free

And we danced beneath a midnight moon
And I took one look, one look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still

And we moved so sweet, sweet and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And then your arms reached out and held me close
And the night stood still

And the night stood still
And we danced, and danced, and danced
We fell in love

And I remember
Oh, the first time that we kissed
Remember thinking to myself could it really be like this

And we danced beneath a midnight moon
And I took one look, one look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still

And we moved so sweet, sweet and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And then your arms reached out and held me close
And the night stood still

223,Good Thing,"[Verse 1]
I book myself tables
At all the best restaurants, then eat alone
I buy myself fast cars

I like my own company
Company, I don't need it
I'm not always cold
I'm just good on my own, so good on my own

I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already got everything I need
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already done everything I dream
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing

[Verse 2]
I make myself up
Just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home
I pose and take pictures
Then send them to people that I don't know
I like getting compliments
Complements how I'm feeling, oh
I'm not always selfish
Just bad at romance, it's not in my bones

I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind

Open fire!

Double edge and double pain

Hold me tighter

It's a fantasy

And the whole damn world doesn't seem to care
I said love
Love is like a butcher knife
Double sharp for single lives

Hold me tighter

이 향기에 좀 취한 채로
난 어쩌면 널 헤매고 있어

내 앞엔 one, two, three and four
또 다른 갈림길 다시 여기
너로 시작해서 너로 돌아와 있는 걸
똑같은 말투 표정도
나에겐 왠지 다 다른 의미
너의 모든 것이 믿을 수가 없게 좋아져

아침이 올 때까지 머물고 싶어 너의 낙원에
내려줘 비처럼 달콤히 your love
스물 네시간 온종일 머물고 싶어 너의 품 안에
기나긴 꿈처럼 영원히 your love

My paradise of love, of love, of love
My paradise of love, of love, of love
My paradise

내 세상 위에 불시착한 너로 인해
나의 모든 것들이 전부 다 흔들리는 중
함께했던 추억 다시 돌아보면 꿈
같아서 터져 버릴까 봐 겁이 나 거품
늪에 있던 내게 손 내밀어
네 손마저 더러워져도 괜찮다고 해줬어
그럼 이제 같이 손잡고 날아야지
중력마저 무의미해 믿고 가만히 안겨줘 내 품

사랑 노래 배경에 대해 물어봐도 너 말고선 nothing
왜 나 따위 안아줘서 찔리고 아파해 내 가시
누나 앞에선 무의미 애완용 고슴도치
혼자선 공허하고 차갑고 무섭기만 한 도시
함께 함에 감사 멀리서 볼 수 없어도
마음과 머릿속 우주에 너로 가득 차있어
가 본적도 느껴본 적도 없지만
말할 수 있을 것 같아 이 시간 I’m in paradise

널 보면 four, three, two and one
시간을 거꾸로 세는 느낌
큰일 날 것같이 숨이 멎을 듯이 떨려 (oh)
나에게 좀 더 보여줘
저 멀리 어딘가 가리어진
눈을 씻고 봐도 이건 말도 안 돼 놀라워

아침이 올 때까지 머물고 싶어 너의 낙원에
내려줘 비처럼 달콤히 your love

233,"In Your Eyes (Theme From ""Say Anything"")","[Intro: Sims]
I had this dream that I was floating
I had this dream that I was floating
I had this dream that I was on top of the tallest building
And I could see everything around me
And I crept my toes over the edge
I had this dream that I was floating
I had the dream that I was on top
And I crept my toes over the edge
And I dropped everything I was holding

[Verse 1: Sims]
I’m tearing down all these outmoded ideas about now
How it’s going, what it is, and how it sounds
And I walk like midnight city in my grip like
Won’t let it slip until I get light
I’m burning all these old bodies, holding no vigils
See which pieces send smoke signals
No combing the ash, let the breeze sort it out
Boarded-out, that house I tore it down

[Hook: Mike Mictlan]
When it all boils down there’s nothing but bones left
When it all boils down there’s nothing but bones left
When it all boils down there’s nothing but bones left
When it all boils down there’s nothing but bones left
Nothing but bones left, nothing but bones

[Verse 2: Dessa]
And it’s the same safe
But the codes won’t work
Guess the joke’s on me
Looks like I’m on first
The map got turnt
Or the river took out the bridge
But we can’t get out
The way that we came in
The compass needle is sticking
The numbers step out of sequence
The stars here look hardly like the ones from last season
And we’ve been leaking diesel since the first freeze
You can leave the car keys in it
I’m getting out

Each brick is a pixel
Each step is a stitch in the dust
Grass it’ll whistle
Buzzed by the breath in your lungs
Get your day in the sun to be young
Streamers on the handlebars
Soft drugs and underwire
Love’s a funny animal
Be careful what you tell yourself
Fairy tales and anecdotes
Both dangerous for amateurs
Born hunter-gatherers
Agriculture-made matadors
Now given all we’ve wanted for
We watch it on the monitors

[Verse 3: Mike Mictlan]
And you won’t know me by incisors or metacarpus
Claim carcass, head on the wall, body starting the metamorphose
They say we bitterly hold grudge
Distorted intent, well consider the sources
Cow tongue, it’s utterly horseshit
Huddled up, the rudder stuck, redirected our forces
Polyamory: fuck everybody
We devoted to the family, balance against the gravity
Self-hate, rediscovered inside misandry
Clean slate, my desire to rule the man in me
Fever for fire, the flame vapor, the skin paper, the blood thicker
Vein fill up sure as a shape-shifter
Follow forward with the sense of the spot blown
Call it origin, everything before it the Dead Zone
Underworld nan-god indivisible
No subliminal, every bit of mass is not critical
Deity Retired, just remember I lived
Cause you won’t know me by my skull or my rib
Locked in, clocked out
Yeah it is what it is
Just remember I lived
Cause you won’t know me by my skull or my rib
Locked in, clocked out
Yeah it is what it is

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Cecil Otter]
And I’m running to home, it’s running me dry
I loved the road but love can be blind
Covered in gold, covered in pride
Under an oath, under-disguised
And suffered the smoke stuck in your eyes
And we priced it, sold its name, nine sips of Novocaine
I sit inside a cell and side with the kinda hell
That likes when you show its pain
Lives off your fear of heights
Strikes when it’s all the same, and it’s feeling like
Like it’s a say anything moment
The reckonings are everywhere, the mezzanine’s closing
So I ain’t holding nothing on safety
Running up the towers, I was running on empty
Break me, shape me under the knife
Raise me up til I’m grown, break another device to set free
Shake the love of my life, tell them nothing was wrong
Tell me nothing was right, prestige

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sims]
This time I slit the throat ruthless
Profuse rouges out the wound
Washing out these blueprints
Hammers to these lead balloons
Cement shoes and useless abuses
{​Leave the wolf--leave the wolf}​ Leave the wolf toothless
I had this dream that I was floating
Free from these explosions in the subtle
Cuffs uncoupled
When I woke wildfire turned the broken into rubble
Turned myself into molten
Poured out what isn’t potent

[Hook]

[Break: Sims]
I had this dream that I was floating

[Verse 6: P.O.S.]
Uh, respect given where it’s livin'
Peace to non-violents populating the prisons
Bag of dicks, follow the money track
Chew on that if you profit off of somebody’s back
Atlas with the standards
Sickle's sharp and red as fuck with my hammer
Chisel tippin', chisel chippin', shaping scenery
Hit the prism, catch a vision, whiff of unity
Let 'em dip and sweat and trip out on the tryptamines
Instead of feeling it’s better living through chemistry
Or probably extra feeling everything
Hyper-realing the fuck out of nights because days sting
And playthings save sentiments
Pain brings them same things to resent and quit
So it’s a chest full of broke toys
And no noise is loud enough to drown me
Got your boy turning every knob to the right
Every button with an arrow up crushed
'Til my vision is bright white
Mute the dialogue, watch the lips move
Change the script around, make that bullshit tight
I been a real self-starter
Found myself swimmingly, real hot water
Since I was young I seem to feel this harder
These guys are fucking kidding me
World made for LARPers
I tend to ghost, knapsack, arrow, and stealth
Full of mean and a copy of Health Is in You!
Sometimes it be like that
Just gotta put the pipe down and get your feelings back, ya heard?
Kids, spitting on teens
Pulling down cloud nine, pissing on dreams
Shitting on em, it's real bodily for me right now

You've been hanging 'round my boyfriend
You've been sayin' that he's sweet, yeah
Girl, I know that you've been talking
Because the talk is on the street
You say that you are gonna steal his heart

Well, I just ain't the kind of woman
To pick the fruit off of your tree, girl
And you keep saying that he's your man
But that ain't what he said to me
He blows me kisses as he drives away

So now what is this?

What can I say?
You know, I realize that you're under pressure
Yes, I am
And that you are suffering from delusions, but uh
Well
Don't be ridiculous
I'm not

You better get real! You know the deal

Yes
And I love my role being his queen
Yes
And I hope you like yours, too
Well, I'm his princess
Whatever that is...
Wait a minute, wait
Come on now...
Okay...well, he said that I'm his princess
You might be his queen, but I'm his princess
Yeah, well, I like being the queen myself

I'm not that kind of guy who can take a broken heart

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

[Verse 2: Ozzy Osbourne & Lita Ford]
Sometimes it's hard to hold on so hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger, you stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in
Your warm and darkened grave?

[Chorus: Lita Ford]
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

Would you ever trust me? No, I'll never feel the same

Joy and pain
Like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain
Like sunshine and rain

[Verse 1:]
Well I'm the new kid, I'm just comin' up
A lot of rappers think that I can't tear it up
Well I'm 'a show 'em and ignore 'em
And when they think I ain't lookin' I floor 'em
I mean take 'em out I keep groovin'
A slick bass line keep the beat movin'
They can't take it they just fake it
They wonder how the Rob Base make it
I get I'll, you know the deal
Cause this is how the Rob Base feels

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I keep smokin', hot like fire
You had the turn, now retire
Don't talk back, I'm not a new jack
Cause I'm fresher than you, an' you're whacked
I keep tryin', I'm not lyin'
Up to number 1 is where I'm flyin'
I won't slow down cause I'm the new kid
With the devastatin' sound that hits
In the house where I used to practice
No one knew the Rob exists, but now
I'm gettin' greedy, don't lead me
The wrong way cause is just might, might, might
Bring me down, I'll have to fight to get back up
Move away cause I just won't slack up

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Now, I go to shows to watch other MCs rock
And if they're good, I don't knock
The way they perform cause I like to see a good show
After that, go play ceelo, y'know
Cause I'm a leader, no I'm not a follower
And MCs like you I swallow 'em
So don't look and try to judge me
Because you think that I'm another MC, well
I'm the new kind, I just moved around
But that don't mean I can't rip up the town
Me an' my boys, we make noise
I hate MCs that think they're with toys
I'm hittin' harder than any other MC
Who try to come up and go against me

[Hook:]

[Verse 4:]
Not from the old school or from the new
Applaud the boom, do what you want to
Talk to me then try to put me down
We used to be cool now we don't hang around
Used to be friends but now we're foes
Ask me why, man, no one knows
Maybe jealousy between you and me
Could be the fame, could be the money
I'm goin' for mine and I don't really care
Cause the spotlight Rob Base don't share
I'm the headliner of this show
And you're just a kid and you need to grow, because

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place

But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game…

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself

Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but
Just you wait, just you wait…

[ANGELICA]
So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
Bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is…

Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less

Schuyler?

He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I’ll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She’d be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

[Bridge]
No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that girl

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to know what's going down
Not with the James, not the Jim, but the Bobby Brown
Now I'm chilling much harder as you all know
Cause Bobby Brown was good to good to good to go solo
Been on the microphone a long long time
I'm guaranteed to bust a stupid rhyme
Now I'm on the mic and I'm rocking real fresher
Everybody out there don't talk less about me
Cause I'm rocking it steady
And when I'm on the mic, don't you dare call me Freddy
Cause I'm ready to really get paid
And if anybody steps in my way they getting slayed
My name is Brown, that's what they call me,
Yes, I drive a 560 SEC
And when I'm on the mic, you gotta see me
Driving down the block cause I'm blocking and locking
When the sucker M.C.'s trying to drop my spot
When I'm rocking on the microphone
People gotta gotta gotta gotta leave me alone
Cause I really don't care, really don't give a damn
My name is Bobby, and not Uncle Sam!

But been unfamiliar with...
Almost everyone but you
[Chorus]

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
I have known this much longer than I've known you

She had trusted many...
And then there would be someone who would enter into her presence
That she could sense for miles...
She dreamed of her wanton luxury
And she laughed and she cried... and she tried to taunt him
And he hated to be separated...
From that picture... No...

Just filled my house with more pistols, the more the better
Lord forgive us but they ain't never want to give us not a thang, so we loaded them thangs went and handle some thangs
Fell in love with drug money and chains

The dramatic achievements in space which have occurred in recent weeks
Should have made clear to us all
As did Sputnik in 1957
The impact of this invention in the minds of men everywhere
Who are attempting to make a determination
Of which road they should take

[Verse 1: Paul Banks]
A captain inspires, that’s what they always say
I’m gonna make it someday
Reach for the skies, let the trees fall as they may
I’m gonna make it someday
I’m gonna make it someday
Freeform disguise, that’s how I kiss my prey
I know I’ll make it some day

[Verse 2: RZA]
Dangerous weapons, proceed at your own discretion
There’s no time for panic buttons or emergency exits
Purge, surge, burn like electric or antiseptic on you germs
There’s no chance for paramedics
This is ancient as the Vedic
Hari Krishna Vishnu
Move the black bishop
Over the world like a guided missile
We shall overcome over drums
No one knows but when the time come
Fa la so ti do killer bee amigo
Artillery c-note
Fresh brewskies from distillery
Cheery like a Cheerios cereal
Eery like a lake full of bodies from the burial
Delirium minds, striving material
Substance accustomed to weakness to the inferior
Trustin this poison that’s pushed through the stereo
Lustin for success, yes
Never getting blessed, no
Because they unwilling to fulfill the spiritual

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
It’s a jungle of lies, I know how to clear my way
I’m gonna make it some day

[Hook: Paul Banks]
Steep like leviathan, flow up like violence
A stone in ocean
A piece til you find you are known there
Very known
Very known
Seep like leviathan, chosen like tyrant
A stone in the ocean
At peace til you find you are known there
Very known
Very known

[Verse 3: RZA]
Trapped inside this schism of capitalism
Baptism, fascism, terrorism
Knowing that all these ism’s is just another prism
Another prison designed to smother vision
How can a child survive inside this world without his mother’s wisdom
For heaven’s sake I been trapped in a pit of snakes
Trying to speed ball through my life then I hit the brakes
Made a right at the light
Come to learn that the light expels the darkness
It’s like softness absorbs the hardness
Are you King, Kennedy
Malcolm X or Marcus
Nazi or Marxist
Narcissist or black caucus
He said listen kid I’ll be whatever it costed
And I’mma be that way until my funds are exhausted
He trusted on the cross, he was double crossed
Kissing on the Bible, then he took it tossed it
It’s like a bad habit dag nabbit, he lost it
The illusion of luxury man cannot afford it

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
Reach for the skies, it’s a free fall all the way
I’m gonna make it someday
I’m gonna make it someday
I’m gonna make it, I’m gonna make it
I’m gonna make it, I’m gonna make it

[Verse 4: RZA]
Adolescents on those antidepressants
No substance, no wisdom, they’re lackin their essence
Sex stressin, quickly undressin’
Now knowin that their future is ruled by their present
Don’t know their lessons
Don’t bear witness to God while life is evidence
They’d rather risk their lives for these old dead presidents
And live in strife in the concrete settlement
Never realizin that man means intelligence
History's irrelevant, knowledge is relevant
Righteousness benevolence, but don’t be malevolent
To those who try to teach you the truth, and bring you testaments
Become the civilized and rise to pure excellence

254,"Rock On (From ""Dream A Little Dream"")","(Verse 1)

Just waking up in the morning
Gotta thank God
I must say, I’m proud to be alive
Proud to be the one
To breathe another day
Receive another 24 hours of time
Last night, I came home
Like the Prodigal son
I guess it may seem
That I was drifting on a dream
A little unsure of my purpose in life
And if my purpose was right
But now I’m bursting on the scene
I hear the birds chirping
As I pull back the curtains
Let the sun shine in
Time to get to grindin’
I wake up every morning
Shower, gather my belongings
And hop out to face this vast world
We reside in
Was destined for rhyming
But figured out that I couldn’t
Contribute to all the negative
Cuz my talent was heaven sent
And this is Evidence
Like Dilated Peoples
Your favorite dreamer is back
For the sequel
So rise and shine

(Chorus)

So rise and shine
Good Morning!
I hope you’re feeling fine!
‘Cuz I’m soaring!
Rise and shine!
Good Morning!
I hope you’re feeling fine!
‘Cuz I’m soaring!

Oh, oh! (Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!) (4x)


(Verse 2)


I told I’m not trying to be the greatest
Not trying to say I’m better than
The veterans that made it
But view how I contemplate it
Two decades I’ve resided
On this third rock from the sun
Got me feeling like my options to fail
Are slim to none
Even through the hardest endeavors
I’m stomping on the devil’s head
He said I could sell drugs
But I ain’t want the devil’s bread
Just to cop the ice
Yellow and white like deviled eggs
I go against the grain
Just to show ‘em what a rebel is
Bask and revel with
All of my rhetoric
Subject and predicate
Black man with etiquette
Still keep it benevolent
I’m presenting prevalence
Just give ‘em evidence
That I can stay relevant
With no neck-a-lace on
But when my records is on
Tell the world
That I reckon it’s on
Young child of the king
So I beckon the throne
And take a seat
Yeah, it’s best to be known
It’s time to…

This is where I come from
I call this place my home
You call this place a slum

Treat poor people just like trash
Turn around and make big cash

But you can't erase a memory
These houses may look all run down

Last month there was a fire
I saw several children die
You sent flowers to their families
But your sympathy's a lie
'Cause every building that you burn
Is more blood money that you earn
We are forced to relocate
From the pain that you create

Now you can tear a building down
But you can't erase a memory
These houses may look all run down
But they have a value you can't see
Now you can tear a building down
But you can't erase a memory
These houses may look all run down
But they have a value you can't see

We lived here for so many years
Now this house is full of fear
For a profit you will take control
Where will all the older people go?
(Go, go, go, go)
There used to be when kids could play
Without the scourge of drug's decay
Now our kids are living dead
They crack and blow their lives away

My brave, my brave
My brave face

[Verse 1]
I've been living in style
Unaccustomed as I am to the luxury life
I've been hitting the town and it didn't hit back
I've been doing the rounds
Unaccustomed as I am to the time on my hands
Now I don't have to tell anybody when I'm gonna get back
Ever since you went away I've had
This sentimental inclination not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheet back on the bed
I want to go bury my head in your pillow

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
Take me to that place

[Chorus]
Where I can't find my brave face
Where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face

My brave face

To the work of a housewife, I've been breaking up
Dirty dishes and been throwing them away
Ever since you left I have been trying to compose a
'Baby, will you please come home?' Note meant for you
As I clear away another untouched TV dinner
From the table I laid for two

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
Take me to that place

[Chorus]
Where I can't find my brave face
Where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face

258,We Can Last Forever,"[Verse 1]
Don't turn away
Because there is something I just want to say
I need you to stay
Don't ask me why
Because I don't even know
How I gave you my heart, I gave it all to you
Now there's no way that I can lose

[Chorus]
Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever
With every little moment we can share
Going to let you know how much I care
I'll always be there

[Verse 2]
Don't walk away
Because there is something I just got to say:
I love you today
Just ask me why
You're all I'll ever need
Now that you're in my life
I really think you should know
That I never want to let you go

[Chorus]
Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever
With every little moment we can share
Going to let you know how much I care
Love lift us away
We can last forever

260,Coming Home,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Intro: Diddy]
I'm back where I belong (Yeah)
I never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing I can't try
And if you feel me put your hands high (Put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
(Baby, put your hands high)
And you, the dreams are for you

[Verse 1: Diddy]
I hear the ""Tears of a Clown,"" uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs
Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
(I'll be better in the morn')
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place where I belong

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Tell the world that I'm coming home (Yeah)
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday (Ain't no more pain)
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world I'm coming home

[Verse 2: Diddy]
“A House Is Not a Home,” I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (Deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (Ballin')
Baby, we been living in sin
Cause we been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world I'm coming

[Verse 3: Diddy]
I'm almost home, check this out
“Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,” I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruisin through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (Here I stand), a better man (Don't stop)
Thank you, Lord! Thank you all!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & (Diddy)]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Let the rain wash away (Feels so good)
All the pain of yesterday (Feels so free)

265,"After All (Love Theme From ""Chances Are"")","Author's Note

...and then you shoot your cousin is the fourteenth studio effort by The Roots, and the concept-album sequel to 2011's magnificent undun.  The Roots are a neo-soul/meta-hip/hop-rap/prog rock (??? how do YOU define The Roots?  Tell me in the suggestions below!) band based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The Roots currently consist of founders Black Thought and Questlove,  keyboardist Kamal Gray, Questlove protégé and percussionist Frank ""Knuckles"" Walker,  Guitarist Captain Kirk Douglas, sousaphonist Damon ""Tuba Gooding Jr."" Bryson, Keyboardist James Poyser, and electric bassist Mark Kelley.  This album was described by Black Thought as a satirical look at violence, hip-hop, and American society on the whole.  The title comes from a KRS-ONE lyric from ""Rapture's Delight.""  There are plenty of features on this album, from Raheem Devaughn, to Michel Chion, to Mary Lou Williams, to guest rapping regulars Dice Raw and Greg Porn, and several others.  Now that you have some background, I present the review, enjoy!



Track #1: ""Theme From Middle of the Night"" (performed by Nina Simone)
Rating: 6/10



This track is an excellent opener for this album.  The eerie strumming and faraway voice set a quiet and mysterious tone for the album, while the lyrics and vocal range offer a more satirical, robust note.  Both of those tones are very prevalent throughout the whole album.  Nina Simone's creepy-while-somehow-soothing voice is a perfect paint for the canvas that the string-heavy beat provides.  A very well-done track, however, in the end it is still just a spoken-word poem over a mellow beat.  That's not to say the poem isn't elegant, and the beat not sonically pleasing, but it is no more than a 6/10



Track #2: ""Never"" feat. Patty Crash
Rating: 9/10



This track right here is what will draw you into this album, from which there is no escape until the last track ends.  First, the hook: the hook is performed by Icelander in Philadelphia, Patty Crash.  The pop-singer has a very childish and cutesy voice with lots of whimsicality.  At first, the reason for her voice on this track was unclear to me, but as the track progressed I realized why:

""All I know is what I know
I woke with a tear drop""

This addition to the hook, performed as an outro explained the reason for Patty, to me.  Not many singers can pull off the childish anguish required to sing this part of the hook passionately

Then comes the rapping.  Black Thought delivers a fiery and, of course, lyrical verse here.  Black experiments with some new flow and vocal distortion which I am impartial to, although don't quite understand the reason for it.  We also get more wonderful technicality from Black that we all love.  His ability to carry one rhyme scheme for 5-6 lines is still sharp as a tack, even at age 42.  Favorite line:

""Life is a bitch and then you live
Until one day by death you're found""

Lastly, the instrumentation.  The track starts with a few dissonant drum beats, succeeded by an angelic and grandiose choir over a sparing piano line.  That involves into a more complex piano line, backed now by the chorus and a gentle cymbal drum beat, which cuts to complete silence by the end of the hook, leaving only Patty singing.  After the hook there's a gentle bass line and some string plucking followed by more eerie plucking (like on track 1) and dissonant noises.  Black rhymes over a sparing bass line and gentle cymbal and bass drum beat.  The song closes with Patty's outro with some high-pitched noises that echo Patty's singing perfectly.  The production started out very emotional and elegant, and in my opinion deteriorated once the verse started, then picked up by the outro

Perhaps my favorite part of this track: the message.  I picture ""Never"" as a character looking down at his past life.  How he will ""Never"" be able change or reconcile, and what will ""never"" be.  It's a powerful message, and The Roots are able to illustrate it subtly, making them the best conscious act in Hip-Hop, in my opinion



Track #3: ""When the People Cheer"" feat. Modesty Lycan & Greg Porn
Rating: 7/10



This track introduces a piano-heavy beat—one of many to come.  It also has another youthful-sounding singer, Modesty Lycan, on the chorus.  This time, however, I do not see any ulterior motive for this musician, especially after the track before this having being Patty Crash.  Does the hook bother me enough to greatly affect my views of this song? Of course not, but this song did have room to improve there

The verses again are subject to pitching and distortion, but they are very high quality verses.  They are sonically pleasing and are filled with wordplay and substance, so the fact that part of Greg Porn's voice is distorted detracts very little.  More flows are experimented by Black Thought, but once again he delivers a very high-caliber verse, as usual.  I give the best verse on this track to Black.  While Porn's verse did deliver and sounded excellent, Black's was longer and had some favorite lines like this:

""And then she gives me lap dances and I’m thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at…""

""Molly poppin’, trolley hoppin’
Know somebody prolly watchin’
That ain’t stoppin’ me from coppin’ a feel
Karate choppin’ in this after-hours spot
Watching mommy body rockin’""

The instrumentation, while minimalistic and piano-heavy, the moving piano line offers another playful-while-sorrowful tone, like the sound of the first track.  But compared to ""Never"", the production here is much less grand.  The message here is nothing too spectacular either.  It deals with lust and addiction, especially with drugs and sex. I think it represents the moral deterioration of society



Track #4: ""The Devil"" Performed by Mary Lou Williams
Rating: 8/10



If you're wondering where the satire is, you've found it!  This is the first time ever that a track from The Roots made me laugh, and a refreshing break from all the seriousness of the conscious rap we heard earlier.  The voice of Mary Lou is one that you simply cannot resist singing along to in a ridiculously goofy imitation.  The ominous choral backings and creepy piano are cheesy, but in the best way possible



Track #5: ""Black Rock"" feat. Dice Raw
Rating: 9/10



This track is very grimy and raw.  There is a very special bonus with this track, Dice Raw singing!  He is a great hook singer with a soulful voice.  His verse is not too extensive though, so I would have to give best verse to Black Thought.  This is straight up Black Thought, Black Thought aggression, flow, and lyricism, and it's awesome.  Delivers a killer verse with one of my favorite lines from the song:

""So love no bitch, die richer than language
Guilty of sin depending on the reeds shaking in the wind""

There isn't much to the instrumentation besides a nice, but grimy jazz piano riff with robust drums and a catchy guitar riff. Although a majority of the instrumentation is sampled, I don't mind.  Sampling is a pivotal aspect of hip-hop and I often wonder myself what certain rock beats would sound like with some rapping over it

I really like the message of this song: the desolation of living on a ""black rock""; in the hood.  My brother told me ""it's kinda weird to think of The Roots as a gritty, from-the-streets act now that they're with Fallon, huh?"" But for me, The Roots still illustrate the societal problems of hood life and poverty beautifully



Track #6: ""Understand"" feat. Dice Raw & Greg Porn
Rating: 10/10



Welcome to the first 10/10 track! I love this track.  The soulful organ and clapping beat is such a refreshing change from the piano-heavy tracks of pretty much all the others.  The electro-bass line that wobbles up and down is also very playful and contrasts the soulfulness of the organ well

Dice Raw is on another hook, although that is more like a spoken-word hook than a singing one.  Black Thought and Greg Porn both have incredibly killer verses, but I give the edge to Porn here.  My favorite lines from Porn's verse were:

""I pray, I pray, all thugs go to heaven
Or to a new hell with a Wi-Fi connection
So I can pay for my sins on PayPal
Or own a holy ghost, a greyhound""

And Black had a great opening to his verse:

""Gravedigger, dig a hole that fit a black nigga
My body's stiff as a Madame Tussaud's wax figure
My transformation: a caterpillar from crack dealer""

Both of these rappers are phenomenal and do a phenomenal job of conveying the messages, and I believe the message here has to do with sins and atonement.  Porn shows the mentality of a ""thug""; that they can just buy their way out of their sins, because that's what solved all their earthly problems.  His lines show little remorse for his sins whatsoever.  Black's verse has to do with violence, and how violence led him nowhere; ""I was a shot away, but I never got away.""  He had a chance at heaven, but missed it because he led a life of violence

The hook also leaves a lot of thoughts in my mind.  Could this mean that people are scared of their sins, or were thinking of god the wrong way the whole time?  I'm not too sure, but whenever I heard this hook, for some reason, I remember a particular Calvin and Hobbes strip...



Track #7: ""Dies Irae"" Performed by Michel Chion
Rating: 5/10



I get avant-garde, but this is a little too avant-garde for me.  The Roots have always had that boho aspect to them, and this reminds me of Phrenology, The Roots's most boho project, in my opinion.  There's not much going on here but dissonance and some shouting.  I can only conjecture on the meaning of this: my guess is that this is an instrumentation of someone getting shot, kinda like how ""Dun"" on the last album was an instrumentation of someone dying.  It makes sense too, because in ""The Coming"" Mercedes sings about, what I think, is the death of someone



Track #8: ""The Coming"" Mercedez Martinez
Rating: 5/10



This is my least favorite track on this album. It is well put together and all, I just don't think that this album needs yet another piano heavy, cutesy sung, distorted track.  The message is actually kinda cool, however.  I see it as a little girl heard a gunshot (this relates to ""Dies Irae"" in my opinion) and she closes her eyes, but because she's already so familiar with death and gunshots, she doesn't have to imagine what has happened.  It's a somber story, but other than relating to ""Dies Irae"" (which is just my guess), I don't quite see why this album needs another one of these tracks



Track #9: ""The Dark (Trinity)"" feat. Greg Porn & Dice Raw
Rating: 10/10



Welcome to the second, and sadly, last, 10/10 of this album

This track starts with a few echoing piano chords, then accompanied with a pretty simple drum snare beat: a nice, laid-back, common time production that really allows the listener to really focus on the rapping, until the string break comes in

And the rapping certainly delivers each part. Three rapping lyricists, each with a different flow and messages.  The most popping verse is Dice Raw's.  This is mainly because of the aggression and intensity.  At the start of his verse, I couldn't even recognize it was Dice because of the intensity he brought. The most lyrical verse is probably Greg Porn's, and the most technical and downright dangerous verse has to be Black's.  That makes this a trifecta, a ""trinity"", of lyrical prowess and social and musical consciousness
My favorite lines from this song:

""Ain't nobody tell you clowns to speak
I'mma AK you down the street
Draw that bump that's built for the riots
See how quiet y'all can keep""
(Black Thought)

I like to think of these lines as subliminals for violence in hip-hop; how rappers often use violence to build up their image or personal

""It's a phrase they say in the streets when the young players meet:
Get rich or die trying
But the funny thing about that phrase to me
Is that these little niggas be lying""

""Yeah I sold crack to get my soul back
They say it’s gonna cost a fortune
And I wonder if Allah take debit?
‘Cause a nigga got real bad credit""
(Dice Raw)

This line is a really strong one.  It shows how much money is emphasized in society and how everyone's goal is to make it, no matter what, even if they don't know how.  He mocks materialism and lust for money in a very lyrical way, with some satire, of course

""The world ain’t ready for someone like me
And life is sex, stress, drama and I’m hookin out 3
I’d rather O.D. than be the next O.G
Than fronting for a whore that already chose me""
(Greg Porn)

Greg is using a very lethargic and dragging flow here.  Some satire is definitely in these lines that I picked out here.  Porn tells us the world isn't ready for him, but then goes on to rap about his weaknesses with drugs and alcohol.  This seems like more popular hip-hop mocking; how rappers will talk about abusing all types of drugs, but still act fearsome

All three verses do have shots at mainstream materialism too.  I think that's what makes this song great: all the popular flows and cadenzas used, the materialism and mocking, and violence in hip-hop.  It really shows that The Roots are not only socially conscious, but at the same time, hip-hop conscious as well



Track 10: ""The Unraveling"" feat Raheem DeVaughn
Rating: 7/10



This track starts with a very, very deep bass and some drums with an echo effect on them.  Then, a wandering piano line played in a minor key joins in on the production.  It is a very melancholy and somber start of the track, but easy to listen to

Raheem sings a very soulful hook, with great meaning to it.  I think the hook is about a character that either is literally dead, or figuratively feels dead; unraveled.  Whatever the case is, this character feels like he or she is at death's door, and at the end of it all, feels relieved.  There's no regret in this song: ""Free of my sins today.""

And then Black comes in and delivers the final verse of the album.  It is short, but it is one of my favorite verses on the whole album:

""What did the thief say onto the hanging man?
'Here come the hounds, lay your burdens down in advance'""

""Free at last!, free at last! A different me at last
Scattered like an ash, or history that's past
Came from nowhere, disappear just as fast""

These are honestly some of the most powerful lyrics on this album, how the thief stole the life and how the character finally feels free in death, how the only liberty in his or her life come's at their last moment of life.  What a chilling set of lyrics!

However, this song is plagues by boringness.  The piano line and simple drum beat are pretty much all the production this track has to offer, and that carries on for over four minutes.  I think this song could have been better if it was shorter, I feel the return to the beat after Raheem's outro was kinda unnecessary.  It could represent the rebirth of the character, but it just dragged out the song for me



Track 11: ""Tomorrow"" feat Raheem Devaughn
Rating: 8/10



This, sadly, is the conclusion to ...and then you shoot your cousin.  And this conclusion actually comes as quite a pleasant surprise for me.  Especially following the sobriety and melancholiness of the last track, I can't help but to be surprised at the jazzy piano line and whistling melody.  I say pleasant, because it is!  After an album full of drear and criticism for society, it was very refreshing to hear the soulful voice of Raheem Devaughn serenade this upbeat production with some very optimistic lyrics

""Some say that happiness will never find you
Until you find yourself
Some say that happiness is all around you
It ain't how you measure your wealth
No, I say it's free to be yourself
We all fall short sometimes
It costs nothing
It costs nothing, to help sometimes""

This kind of optimism was nowhere to be found on all the previous tracks, and I love it.  The message here does not come off as corny whatsoever, and it is a truly uplifting track, I cannot think of a better ending myself.  But that's the genius of The Roots; you never know what to expect.  I must say, however, after about three-and-a-half minutes, the track did get sort of boring, but beautiful, cantabile piano finish revived it

I think that ""Tomorrow"" and ""The Unraveling"" are meant to go together.  The drum beats are almost the same (at least to my ears), and the mood of the track is ultimately determined by the piano, one is a minor key piano, and the other is a more jazzy, major key riff.  Both are sung by Raheem, both sung in different moods and tones.  ""The Unraveling"" talks about finding freedom, and rebirth, then ""Tomorrow"" picks up from that theme and adds gratefulness and appreciation for life.  The way I see it, is that, the character in both of these tracks is the same.  In ""The Unraveling"" he or she is at death's door, but somehow survives, and has a whole new perspective on life, described in ""Tomorrow.""

Damn

Heheheh
Ugh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

[Verse 2: Miguel]
I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

[Chorus: Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3: Miguel]
'Cause being your friend is killin' me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time
I wonder so often, regret gets exhaustin'

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

All I want is you now, baby
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Bridge: Miguel & J. Cole]
Cause they don’t smile, huh, or smell like you
And they don’t make me laugh, or even cook like you
And they don’t photograph, nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it (yeah) I can’t replace it (yeah)
That's why all I want is you now

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, ""I’m wrong"", you say, ""Come again?""
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I’m prayin', you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby, boomerang, 'rang, huh

[Chorus: Miguel]
That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar

277,Cuddly Toy (Feel For Me),"I know you've heard so many people say
I've got a different girl in every town
But there must be somebody telling lies
And spreading rumours, spreading rumours all around

Because my only joy, is a cuddly toy
Waiting for me when I get home
And what I need is a girl like you
To call my very own

So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
And give me some love

Well I don't pour out my heart like this, to everyone
And anyone that I meet
And I know it ain't the wine 'cause I feel just fine
Can't you see baby, I'm still on my feet

A cuddly toy is my only joy
Waiting for me when I get home
And what I need is a girl like you
To call my very own

So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
And give me some love

A cuddly toy is my only joy
Waiting for me when I get home
And what I need is a girl like you

278,Moonlight On Water,"[Verse 1]
What's going on down on the planet
What's going on inside your pretty head
What's life without a Mercedes
And the need to feel adrenaline rush

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it better than moonlight on water
Is it better than sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us it's not out of reach

[Chorus]
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
No matter where you go no matter what you do
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna be the competition?
Who's next in line for promotion, baby?
Everyday the real world is fading
Spinning out on the wheel of fortune but

Is it better than sex on the beach?
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us it's not out of reach, babe

I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
No matter where you go no matter what you do
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am

[Bridge]
You've been working so hard
Don't you know it, baby?
You don't understand what I want from you
Instead of dreamin' 'bout all that money
We got such simpler things to do

Like moonlight on water
Like sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us it's not out of reach, babe

I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
No matter where you go no matter what you do
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to

279,You Are The One,"[Verse 1]
Black rose and a radio fire
It's so contagious
It's just something changing my mind
I'm gonna take what's evil
Your cover melting inside
With wide eyes, you tremble
Kissing over and over again
Your God knows His faithful

[Chorus]
I try to digest my pride
But passion's grip I fear
When I climb, into shallow vats of wine
I think I almost hear
But it's not clear

You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...
You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...

[Verse 2]
Spin faster, shouting out loud
You can't steal what's paid for
It's just something hurting again
Murdersome, she's painful
You so believe your own lies
On my skin your fingers
Run away until the last time
We're gonna lose forever

[Break]
When you try
Don't try to say you won't
Try to crawl into my head
When you cry, 'cause it's all built up inside
Your tears already said
Already said

[Bridge]
You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...
You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...

You'll never be alone again

And the pressure is hot to want more than you got
I don't hear what they're saying
Day out and day in

You
You are my one temptation

You
You are the one I've no resistance to
Nobody knows you are my one temptation

Oh yeah

Start praying, praying to a new God

Everybody can be famous for a day

Start praying to a new, new God
Start praying what are you afraid of
Start praying to a new--

There's a big world
In the street outside
In their uniform of pride
And they've all come
To see a star from the east
Is he man or beast?
Decide

Feel like I'm crucified, still I'm not satisfied
The second coming is coming anyway

I hear them pray for more on every dance floor
I hear the word go out across the milky way
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah
Oh yeah
It's another second coming, like it or not
You better start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying to a new God
Start praying to a new, new God

Start praying to a new--

Start praying, praying on the freeway
Start praying to a new, new God
Start praying, praying on the airwaves
Start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying at the back door
Start praying to a new, new God
Start praying, praying on the dance floor

Alright, dig it

[Verse 1]
Cold coolin at a bar, and I'm lookin for some action
But like Mick Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin def, yo, what's up with L-o-c?
The girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar
Havin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" he said, ""Funky Cold Medina""

Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

[Verse 3]
I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink,"" I said, ""Ehm - ok, I'll go get it""
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina

You know, ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies, ya know?

Break it down

[Verse 4]
Back in the saddle, lookin for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on ""The Love Connection""
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin
Instead she started talkin 'bout plans for our wedding
I said, ""Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina

Ya know what I'm sayin
That Medina's a monster, y'all

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow
You can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate

I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

312,Seventeen,"[Verse 1]
Never worry 'bout a single hatin' motherfucker
Lookin like my next supper, all these moves that I'm makin' got people talkin
Like how many papers is this man signin', I'm back wit' the backpack rap
Man I'm thinkin' that this shit finna make them scat, got a bag full of cash if we talkin' 'bout that
Run, run it like Forrest Gump can you feel that, ayy
I'm a renaissance man, if you wanna get a feat you not gon' get response man
I be hotter than some shit your mom cook in a sauce pan
Don't be jealous, don't be rude, go back to rollin' up grams
People think I'm sick as shit but I'm just eatin' on ham
Wanna beat me in my game then bitch I'm settin' up camp
When the females hear my name I know they pussy all damp
Mr. Veterinarian I make that kitty go ham (Damn)

[Chorus]
Ballin', only seventeen, my skin is green
Watching numbers goin' up that's just the everyday routine
All my old friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin like I'm Cube I always hit 'em with no vaseline

[Post-Chorus]
Always sayin' no when you ask 'em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin' up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin' on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin' all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie

[Verse 2]
You got cash, buy some chains, I buy houses ain't that strange
You ain't shit, I get lit, all you do is counterfeit
Little chick, but she thick, and she always on my drink
Shit I'm thirsty give it back, and she blondy just like Zac
(""Who the fuck is Zac?"" ""high school musical"")
Bitch hold my stacks I'm 30 minutes late to France
Gotta get this cash, never give no chance, better bounce that ass, paid her an advance
Got me through this day, sippin' on Bombay, I don't trust you gotta take this survey
Man I don't look back, never cut no slack, better get way back, 'fore yo ass get smacked, uh
Memphis flow but I'm from Jakarta ho, never understood my hustle but I guess the more you know
Checkin' on your Instagram I see that shit is going slow, always hating on the progress man yo ass has gotta go

Ballin', only seventeen, my skin is green

All my old friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine

Never been near a university
Never took a paper or a learned degree
And some of your friends think that's stupid of me
But it's nothing that I care about

[Chorus 1]
Well, I don't know how to tell the weight of the sun
And of mathematics well, I want none
And I may be the mayor of Simpleton
But I know one thing and that's I love you

[Post-Chorus]
When their logic grows cold and all thinking gets done
You'll be warm in the arms of the mayor of Simpleton

[Verse 2]
I can't have been there when brains were handed round
(Please be upstanding for the mayor of Simpleton)
Or get past the cover of your books profound
(Please be upstanding for the mayor of Simpleton)
And some of your friends (some of your friends)
Think it's really unsound that you're even seen talking to me

[Chorus 2]
Well, I don't know how to write a big hit song
And all crossword puzzles, well I just shun
And I may be the mayor of Simpleton
But I know one thing and that's I love you

[Bridge]
I'm not proud of the fact that I never learned much
Just feel I should say
What you get is all real, I can't put on an act
It takes brains to do that anyway (and anyway)

[Chorus]
And I can't unravel riddles, problems and puns
How the home computer has me on the run
And I may be the mayor of Simpleton
But I know one thing and that's I love you (I love you)

[Verse 3]
If depth of feeling is a currency
(Please be upstanding for the mayor of Simpleton)
Then I'm the man who grew the money tree
(No change of office and no hope of getting one)
Some of your friends (some of your friends)
Are too brainy to see
That they're paupers and that's how they'll stay

[Chorus]
Well, I don't know how many pounds make up a ton
Of all the Nobel Prizes that I've never won
And I may be the mayor of Simpleton
But I know one thing and that's I love you (I love you)

When all logic grows cold and all thinking gets done
You'll be warm in the arms of the Mayor of Simpleton

Big bucks and a big brass pole
It's time for big smoke to put a hurt on...

Big smoke from a birthday suit

Makes a man think this has gotta be wrong

You got to stay away from me
Stay away from me!

Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""

I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night?""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string

Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing

Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
Goddamn your ex-man is a dumb ass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?
Was he stressing you, wasn’t fucking you right?
Well one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure

If you're out on a date
And you bring it home late it's a sin
There just ain't no excusin'
You know you're gonna lose and never win
I'll say it again

[Chorus]
And it's all because
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll?

[Bridge]
You pull into a drive-in
And find a place to park
You hop into the backseat
Where you know it's nice and dark
You're just about to move-in
Thinkin' it's a breeze
There's a light in your eyes
And then a guy says
""Out of the car longhair""
""Louie, you're comin' with me""
""The local police""

[Outro]
And it's all because
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll

And your daddy don't rock and roll

336,You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet,"[Instrumental Lead In]

[Verse 1]
I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said, I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way
I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Mmh, mmh, mmh
She looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

[Chorus]
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Nothin' yet, you ain't been around

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said

[Chorus]
You ain't seen nothin' yet

You got something for me when I get home
Better be good

337,The Living Years,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

[Chorus]
Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be OK

[Chorus]

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

339,When Love Comes To Town,"I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke-joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazed and in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

(Lost lyrical stanza)
When I woke up I was sleeping on the street
I felt the world was dancing, and I was dirt beneath their feet
When I woke up I saw the Devil looking down
But my Lord He played guitar the day love came to town",U2,1989,"[86, 77, 68, 69, 72, 79, 89]",7

349,Repetition,"I remember the bed just floating there.
Apart, apart, apart, apart.
My mother taught me this trick
If you repeat something over and over again it loses its meaning
For example:
Homework, homework, homework, homework, homework, homework, homework, homework, homework
See, nothing
Our existence, she said, is the same way.
You watch the sun set too often, it just becomes 6 PM
You make the same mistake over and over; you’ll stop calling it a mistake
If you just
wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up,
one day you’ll forget why
Nothing is forever, she said
My parents left each other when I was 7 years old
Before their last argument they sent me off to the neighbor’s house,
like some astronaut jettisoned from the shuttle.
When I came back there was no gravity in our home, beds floating
I imagined it as an accident, that when I left
They whispered to each other “I love you” so many times over
that they forgot what it meant
Family, family, family, family, family, family
My mother taught me this trick
If you repeat something over and over again it loses its meaning
This became my favorite game
It made the sting of words evaporate.
Separation, separation, separation;
see, nothing
Apart, apart, apart;
see, nothing
I am an injured handyman now
I work with words all day
Shut up, I know the irony!
When I was young, I was taught that the trick to dominating language
was breaking it down
Convincing it that it was worthless
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you;
See, nothing
Soon after my parents’ divorce, I developed a stutter
Fate is a cruel and efficient tutor
There is no escape in stutter
You feel the meaning of every word drag itself up your throat
S-s-s-separation
Stutter is a cage made of mirrors
Every “Are you ok?”
Every “What’d you say?”
Every “Come on kid, spit it out”
Is a glaring reflection you cannot escape
Every terrible moment skips upon its own announcement
Over and over until it just hangs there,
floating in the middle of the room
Mom, Dad,
I am not wasteful with my words anymore.
Even now after hundreds of hours of practicing away my stutter,
I still feel the claw of meaning in the bottom of my throat.
I have heard that even in space;
You can hear the scratching of a
I-I-I-I love you.",Phil Kaye,1989,"[93, 77, 76, 78, 86, 94]",6
350,"Let The River Run (Theme From ""Working Girl"")","[Modenine]
It's the Flygerian, going H.A.M with the hustle
Run up on the Mode and pull a hamstring muscle
If you got an old bone to pick, bury the fossil
Or else , it's gonna be a one-sided tussle
You can tango, I'm all about the cash, Kurt Russell
Up front payment, money in the duffle, bag
But over here, they desecrating the art form
Lying to themselves like, Mode too hard for 'em
I raise the bar, you finishing where I start from
You far from a beast on the mic, you need a stronger grip
I got no endorsement, no sponsorship
They want a song about a silly dance, a monster hit
I ain't got that, but I got bars to make you back flip
Put the beat in a casket, when the Polymath spit
My peers pull me down, it's like I'm rapping from a crab's pit
All I'm trying to do is fill my bread basket

[AWKWORD]
AmeriKKKa, that's with three Ks
We need a man in a cape in the land of the brave, these days
Cave man cut my Capital One, for one, cause it isn’t pre-paid
And summer's always here, get out the street to beat the heat wave
Popped a pen, poured on paper to prove my beats slayed
But when Peter Piper picked a peck, the peppers were afraid
Always been the same, new ways to lynch a slave
We can march a million miles, make sense but no change
While bastards build a billion bars to break us with the cage
On The Other Side of the River, they do drugs at a rave
Seniors sleep soundly, estates safe cause a gates
We on the outside like, bitch, we bend but don’t break
It's like Apartheid, resist, in Mandela's six names
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, Zulu mind frame

[Five Steez]
Looking at my life, there's one constant
My outlet always been this lyrical content
I never turn my back on this craft
Regardless of how I earn my cash on this path
The industry shady, sometimes, only stress
But I chose my direction and there's no regrets
I love music, with the biz, I was infatuated
'Til I realized most people masquerading
I do my art from the heart, hope it reach you
I'm fulfilled cause my songs spoke to people
Still slaving on the plantation, working to make it
You can never find a verse where I fake it
And yes, I know my purpose is sacred
Hailing from Kingston, Jamaica, the turf of the greatest
You can hear the hunger and thirst on these pages
And the genius in the nouns and verbs in these statements

[Holstar]
An '80s baby, when Hip Hop was in its infancy
Like let there be light, with open eyes they said, this infant sees
An African drum beat, bare feet, the ground cracks open
My ancestors can't let this vocal cords from me
They can source from me, but double XL with the sorcery
An African kid who wanna blast at the kid
Mastered a bit, now the Grandmaster Flash faster
LSK is my pulpit, Zambian rap pastor
Said I'd never be the best, but the best rocking a bullet vest
Spitting my verbal cannons, heart in my hand, I got an open chest
I more than live it, I embody the culture
Trying to save Hip Hop's carcass from these industry vultures
Fiends is tumultuous, Hip Hop is in a state of emergency
But they earn, you see? And they still don't see, the urgency

Dedicated to my dedication
Writing out my heart in this Q Train station
Man ya'll don't know what this girl been facing
Keep a slight grin, but the game grim, acting Grinch with my patience
Case in point, I be pointing out the cases
Vicious cycles with the denominator is faceless
Whose arrival making us hate us in occasion
Making our fate seem like The Matrix
All I want in life is to make living off a mics
Keep my fam straight, keep the people outta hype
And let 'em know the weight that they feel, we feel it too
The pressure in the rough, makes a shorty shine through
The see through, the evils, they teach you
But ego is pivotal, to the ways of getting you

My mama raised a soldier
Malawian born, but shooting global 'til it's over
Technology low, yo, my Internet slow, so
I'm shooting every rhyme, every single time, every front line, that's a soldier
The warm heart of Africa, there's never no war
But then we fight against the odds just to even the score
But in Malawi what's war, is adding up all these votes
For these fat politicians never knowing the score
They told us it's a draw, but now we celebrate the victory
Somebody explain these blood stains on my history
Dictators burn books, companies burn statistics
We end up just another number, it's sadistic
The floods are coming up, because the rain is going down
Thought I was coming up, until the floods came around
Malawi's named after a flame, so just imagine
A flame standing over the flood, and then he drown

No one to give me, so you know, I had to take mine
With TEC-9s, no, taekwando
Yes, but I was always equipped with a great mind
No one heard me through the grapevine
They say the best never come with a warning, so it's a great sign
So fuck they talk about why I ain't signed
Trust me I'll be all they talk about, at the finish line
Bilingual, beasting through these mixtapes, no single
Married to the game, yes and still single

And I'm fresh off a lick like an old Tic-Tac
You done fucked up like you take a step back
Cool cat like a stray in a freezer in the back
Like you're Jay-Z, no Roc-A-Fella holla back
But I'm 'bout the damn money boomerang back
Okay like lisp, is how I speak 'cause I sip
Lean like what's done on your bitch
In your mouth, I fit a fist
Pistol best friends with my hip
Like T.I., bitch as a tip
I don't get head, I get lip
The sauce is water I dripped
The sauce is water I, ayy

359,Similar Features,"Go on and close your eyes
Go on, imagine me there
She got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Go on and close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you

You never had to wait
For nothing in your life
I guess wanting me must have been
A steel blue knife
And when night after night
The scent of passion would linger
You had to have the jewels
Wrapped around your finger
Now you keep running down the road
In your midnight state of mind
Curiosity kills
If you can't read the signs

Go on and close your eyes
Imagine me there
She got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Go on and close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you

Dancing with the wall
Made you bitter and sweet
There ain't much you can do
When they just lay it at your feet
But could you tell by the song
I wanted to be the one?
Did you listen again
When the damage was done?
Now the paint's still wet
In your do-it-by-number dream
Are you gonna tell me how it felt?
Will you tell me what it means?

Go on and close your eyes
Go on, imagine me there
She got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Go on and close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you

Was it want
With no desire?
Was it smoke
With no fire?
Did I say
It doesn't rip me apart?
I lied
I'm sorry, dear
My hands are tied

Go on and close your eyes
Go on, imagine me there
She got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Go on and close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you

Close your eyes
Imagine me there
She's got similar features
With longer hair

Some would say I’m great/
But some would say I’m awful/
Some stay away/
Others follow like apostles/
Some days I slay/
The others I’m a lost soul/
I got cold feet/
Thoughtful as I be/
My thoughts my enemy/
Attacking my self-esteem/
Pretend to be a century old/
With nothing but wisdom/
But truth be told/
I know less than some kids man/
Hidden in these lines/
A story I ain’t tellin/
My girl quella/
Taking her to d-ville/
Devil, that’s what I be/
In the city of g-ville/
Shouting are you listening?/
And then everything go quiet/
And I hear my own echo/ echo/
Some people all jewels
But they ain’t no substance/
They been deco’d/ deco’d/
Make a new track/
Shit hot, like perfecto/ ecto/
Magnifique/
Like her physique/
Even if she don’t think so/
Life go by in a blink so/
Live fast die young/
Bad bitches do it well/
Well I ain’t a bad bitch/
But hell I got my shit together/
So Imma take it slow/
And try and live forever/
My problems a hydra/
I’m just severing the heads/
And burning up they necks/
And wondering what’s next/
Stomach churning/
So uncertain/
Is it worth it/
Is it worthless/
Is it gifts/
Or is it curses?/
Permanent servant/
Serving pertinent sermons/
About a singular purpose/
Surface dwellin vermin/
Just tryin’ to swerve faster/
A man of great stature/
Just trying to be the master/

Well I know
There are times when- you're feeling close to the ground
And there's times when- you may feel there's no place to call home
And there's times when- your best friend just seems so far away
And there's times when- the only end in sight is the end

You've got to come out fighting! Come out fighting! Come out fighting!
Don't let it get you down

Problems! I've got em too but keeping them inside is not the thing to do
Problems! You've got to face hang-ups head-on, before you know they're hangin' you

You've got to come out fighting! Come out fighting! Come out fighting!

All alone yes all alone. Loneliness, it is something we all know
Woooh all alone, yes all alone. Been there before so please believe me
'cause I know

Woooooooooh. Sorry to say to your dismay your life is not the only one that you affect
Don't you realize that a part of all of us will die inside when you yourself are dead

Too long I've been denying myself
Hostage to thoughts of somebody else
And all the while you
Have been wishing to
Love on me

When you saw me
For what I could be
Then I finally saw the same

Sees the lover in you
And I'm happy to say that I'm so not afraid
For the lover in me
To meet the lover in you
'Cause I see what we'll be
And the lover in me loves you

[Verse 2]
Past, it's just that
Leave it where it's at
I want to live in the moment with you (Moment with you)
Wasted so much time
Stumbling, but now I'm
Spreading my wings and beginning again

Mixed feelings and misgivings
That's all a memory now, baby
When you saw me
For what I could be
Then I finally saw the same

370,When I'm With You,"[Verse 1]
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
Only you can tell

[Chorus]
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you

371,Do You Believe In Shame?,"Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in shame?
And if love can conquer all
Then why do we only feel the pain?

I heard you speak my name
Heard you singing The Stones
Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static
On my telephone

So why your eyelids are closed
Inside a case of rust
And did you have to change
All your poet's fire into frozen dust?

I try to justify it
To learn from your mistake
But where's the stupid lie that has to make its point
With such a pointless waste?

Come out

Do you believe in shame?
Do you believe in love?
And if they taste the same
Would you love again or abandon both?

I don't think I ever can
Believe my friend has gone
Keep saying it's alright, I'm going to bring you back
But I know I'm wrong

There's nothing I can say
There's nothing left to do
Just that lately I feel so damn lonely
When I think of you

And it may seem selfish now
But I'll hold on to the memory
Until all this fear is washed away

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in life?
'Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die
'Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die
Yes, I believe a little part of you inside of me

I was hanging with some friends of mine
We were out having a real good time, yeah
I saw a girl who was so very fine
I started waving my hands, my arms, my head
Got the nerve; found the words to say, yeah
But to my surprise, she was passing
I mean, it was strange 'cause she just walked away
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

Now you're nervous with the fever
Body heat to never quit
I'm in heaven when I see her
Hope she talks a little bit, a little bit
(What'cha gonna do?)
You can't sit there all night, no honey, all by yourself
(I just wanna talk to you) And nobody else, yeah

[Verse 2]
I just wanna tell her
She's the girl of my fantasy
How we meet in my dreams every night it seems
And how love can be, I wanna (love you)
I'm gonna be (your love)
It's not everyday you see the one
That your heart's been nightly dreaming of
There's that look in her eyes, so I don't know why
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

She pretends she doesn't see me
Leaves me standing in the rain
'Cause I know she wants to meet me (I know, I know)
She's just playing silly games
(What'cha gonna do?)
Wanna show you a love that you just, you gotta see
(I just wanna talk to you) But she won't talk to me

[Bridge]
And ooh, I'm telling everyone
I'm not dreaming anymore
'Cause I know she won't talk to me now
And at least she can't say no

And I'm going crazy, yeah

The mythic and mighty that fall when you lean
Bring down the moon
Building love on thin air and dreams
Perfect love is a desperate creed
And one that we all try to believe
So bring down the moon

I'm finding some comfort
In closing the distance
Between my life and my dreams
If love's not forever
I need to discover
The spirit of romance and magic
In living from day to day

Perfect love has no guarantee
Still we keep trying to believe
So bring down the moon

Well there's no guarantee
That there ever will be perfect love

We got something they can't take away

Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (all night)
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)

We just, hurt each other
We're destroying each other
And we are just fading away
Soon there will be no place to go
Reach the end of all we know
With small minds we can not grow
We are just fading away

[Verse 1]
Its kinda funny when you think about it
The fact that we're all in this
Together
But yet we still complain about it
Separated by race, or religion
Or the income that what makes me come to basis
On whether or not to embrace them
We got to stop with the hatin'
For heaven's sake we're mistakin'
With all
This blatant shameful acts of abomination
These trials and tribulation should be the education
To make sure history doesn't
Repeat itself with these mistakes again
To put it in laymen
We're just some homosapiens inhabitan'
The same planet
And having to maintain within
Maybe we could work together
To make this
Place better for future generations
The Children
Someday they may never experience
Hunger and famine
Disease and planet contaminants
Extinction level damage
Leaving them stranded and ravished
Submerged in sabotage from these centuries of habits
Like thieves in the Night stole their future
Before they could even have it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man its so volatile how we're falling like dominos
Just drowning in our own sorrows no thought of what tomorrow holds
And these seeds of misery are sproutin'
You can clearly see you and me have been deceived and its astounding
How we all journey through life
Conflicted with all the strife
Afflicted with all these lies
Tryin' to simply survive
Hoping our souls will suffice
Just need to open our eyes
And see the devils disguise
Or sadly meet our demise
And I know it seems impossible
To topple these obstacles
And things ain't always what they appear to be inside the optical
Illusion of human ruin that you and me is pursuin'
So cruel and unusually worded and congruent with influence
To destroy and deceive us all
Place our back against the wall
Bringin' ourselves to a crawl
Dwell on each and every floor
Is it to true to recall?
And we not even evolved?
Is there to much to resolve?
Now we all, now we all fall

[Hook]x3

'Cause I ain't hit the pinnacle, yeah, I'm still persevering
Demons whispering in my ears, but no, I never fear them
People thinking they on his level they ain't even near him
I just want to spread positivity through lyrical ability
They call it selling out but I just call it versatility

Tell me where was you last year when a brother was down?
Not a single one of you motherfuckers believed in the brand
Extended a hand, and now you wanna be my man?

Don't you want me, Mama? Don't you love me, Mama?"" What the fuck

How can I explain the fear you feel inside
Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killing man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again

[Chorus:]
When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 2:]
Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

[Chorus]
When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 3:]
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children cry let them know we tried
When the children fight let them know it ain't right
When the children pray let them know the way
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins",White Lion,1989,"[100, 84, 75, 65, 41, 34, 23, 13, 5, 3, 5, 9, 14, 19]",14
383,What I Am,"[Verse 1]
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box
Religion is the smile on a dog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know if you know what I mean

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

[Chorus]
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are, or what?

[Verse 2]
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
Philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocks
Religion is a light in the fog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

What I am is what I am

384,We've Saved The Best For Last,"Now that we are older
Our hearts have all grown up
Just a little wiser
But are we wise enough?
Watching imitations of the real thing
You and I have both been fooled before

But this time, we win
Our ship has just come in
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last

Now that we are younger
Than we were last night
You can be my arrow
I'll be your guiding light
There isn't any danger we can't handle

But this time, we win
Our ship has just come in
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last
Tonight entwined
This love is genuine
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last

We've both had enough of hesistation
Didn't matter, didn't matter

But this time, we win
Our ship has just come in

387,Halleluiah Man,"On the blind side and down the back ways
The roots of sadness crawl
When you can't get what you need
You feel like taking a torch to it all

All the sweet talk makes a bitter man
You can feel the darkness rise
Sometimes you don't know what you're fighting for
You don't know who it is you despise

I am the Halleluiah Man
Break all the rules I'm the King of fools
I'm the renegade in this greytown
And I'll do anything to bring a government down
I am the Halleluiah Man
Yes my friends I've been born again
I'm the black sheep who while shepherds sleep
Will do anything to bring a government down

In a coat of a thousand colours
And a star spangled Cadillac
He picked up a rodeo queen
With whiplash marks all over his back

When dreams don't become their people
People become their dreams
He didn't understand at the time
But now he knows exactly what it means

I am the Halleluiah Man
Break all the rules I'm the King of fools
I'm the renegade in this greytown
And I'll do anything to bring a government down
I am the Halleluiah Man
Yes my friends I've been born again
I'm the black sheep who while shepherds sleep
Will do anything to bring a government down

They said watch out boy be careful where you tread
You're throwing away all that beautiful bread
He slept outside until the world opened up
They've got to understand he's a Halleluiah Man

He says I am the Halleluiah Man
And I'll do anything to bring a government down

He built himself a prison
He knew he had to escape
Some worlds are held together by steel
Some worlds are held together by sellotape
He was drifting through the sharks teeth
He always paid his dues
When something told him he had nothing
That's when he knew he had nothing to lose

He says

I am the Halleluiah Man
Break all the rules I'm the King of fools
I'm the renegade in this greytown
And I'll do anything to bring a government down
I am the Halleluiah Man
Yes my friends I've been born again
I'm the black sheep who while shepherds sleep
Will do anything to bring a government down

388,The Way You Love Me,"[Prod. by KDot]

[Intro: Joe Budden]
Turn me up in the headphone something
(New Joe Budden)
Look

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
First off let me shout out the fam, y'all so gracious
Been chilling in the room for growth, it's so spacious
Getting to the money, counting these old faces
Like I found the smoking gun in cold cases (nah)
Them dark thoughts never got to 'em still
I'm like the legendary Robin Will
Even though I understand
I never dealt with the pain like that
A knot from that same rope
But I don't hang like that
We had a couple break-ups
Gotta respect Cuzz and I'll hit the reset button
You try to reset Budden, it's real
My accomplishments
Already show 'em how I deal with the consequence
And you can ask Consequence
She reached out via text like ""What up with the guy?""
Which is weird, it's been a year
Since we fraternized
Still I made my way back in her life
Only to prove to myself I wouldn't fuck up twice
We reminiscing, thinking hella back
You had to watch me with her but to hell with that
Cause I think that me carrying that thought
Kind of washed me with her
And even that's cool cause me and you is not me and her
I took a little hiatus, hope you could see the change
I was too high to say this, how could I explain?
Though my mouth was quiet
My mind was like a Ferguson riot
Why it only get worse when I'm in private
Were we victims to the game
Trying to do it over
Here's the gift for an exchange
It's timeout for the public
These niggas won't know a thing
So we keep each other blocked on Twitter
It's not a game
Like a picture in a frame for now
Drunk models, couple Swishers and a stack here

[Hook: Felicia Temple]
Everytime I walk away, you need me
But your words don't mean a thing when you're not here
Tell me is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me is this the way
The way that you care

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
She said she wanna set boundaries
Can't continue to have you surrounding me
Cause that'll lead to you on this couch pounding me
That'll bring them feelings back
That's just out of bounds to me
It's been years, last bitch ain't come around to me
Send my tone of voice down
Like you speaking down to me
Said I said some things to begrudge you
But I can't ask to not be judged then judge you
She said; all this time I've been screaming ""Fuck You""
When she implies I can't move on I'm stuck too
Blood flowing, there's an adrenaline rush too
Every time I'm tryna leave
It's when you're in a rush too
She said; looking back I can see how you was gaming me
Which is fine, I can see how you could feel there
Which means I just gotta ask you one question though
If it was game tell me why them feelings still there?
I know the answer to that: you still fallin'
You ain't never felt so strong, it feels foreign
Probably got me saved in her phone as Phil Collins
Hear it in the air of the night it's still callin'
Every time you see me a couple of bills on him
Got rich then did it again we still ballin'
You ain't gotta respond to that
If you did it would look like it's a con to that
I'm so far beyond of that
Chillin' with a couple of hoes that like hoes
That like niggas that don't act like hoes
I don't say that cause I'm vain
Or some strangers can know I'm the man
We not fucking
Sometimes it's better knowing you can't
She come running back
Every time she throw in the can
Just to holla when she feel like not a soul understand
Baby, I already proved that I ride out
You can't bear to be hurt again so you hide out
You ain't gotta say that, I know you inside out
We communicate so well when all the pride's out
You gotta give it one more go, we ain't tried out
Nah that love wouldn't a been real if it died out

Yeah, I’ve just been so numb, it feels like nothing’s real
I’ve just been so empty, I can’t fuckin’ feel
But I can feel my body start to fade
My heart is cold that’s why I’m so sick of taking all these fuckin’ pills
I don’t ever talk about it much
Drinking every day, just to escape the memories of us
You paint me as a villain, but my blood is on your brush
I was in it 'til the end, you was in it for the rush
See I’m scared of being hurt and I’m scared of getting close
'Cause the closest people to you are the ones that hurt you most
But it's hard to know your worth when everything is broke
Now I’m just drownin' in my sorrow tryin' not to fuckin' choke
The more pain you go through, the harder it feel
And the scars that we can’t see are the hardest to heal
I gave you everything, I’m just left with all of these pills
And even though I fuckin' hate you, you have part of me still
Cry for you, I promised that I'd never fuckin' cry for you

Bleed for you, I do anything, I fuckin' bleed for you
Why can’t you understand? I fuckin' needed you

398,Armageddon It,"[Verse 1]
You better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if you don't wanna dance
You like a four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can
You got it
But are you getting it?
You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun

Hey, but are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Come get it from me

You try coming on when you need some
But then you don't because you already did
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while you're shaking your

You flash your bedroom eyes like a jumping Jack
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back

Ooh, really getting it?

Take it, take it, take it from me
I got an itchy finger following me
Pull it, pull it, come on trigger the gun

399,Every Rose Has Its Thorn,"[Verse 1]
We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

[Verse 2]
I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn

[Bridge]
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

[Verse 3]
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

[Verse 4]
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess

Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song

400,Two Hearts,"[Verse 1]
You stole my heart bae
If you only knew
How much it breaks my heart
When you say things like ""I hate you""
The sound of it almost gave me a heart attack
I bet if I said I would leave you, you wouldn't even care
If you saw me bawlin' tears, I bet you wouldn't even shed one (not one)
Do you even love me like you say I wonder?
Uh huh, damn that's fucked up
Lord please tell me why I love her
Girl I'll beg you for my heart back
Shouldn't have to go through all that

[Hook]
You'll do fine with just one
Why you gotta be so selfish?
Why you gotta be so selfish?
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna get what's mine back
Never mind that
You don't need two hearts
(You stole my heart, give it back to me)

[Verse 2]
So in love, I can't think straight
Please get the fuck out of my head baby
I wanna take a ride, where will I go?
My favorite places we created memories in those
I know you think my heart is fine but it isn't though
Your love, I need it here, physical
Do I gotta beg you for my heart back?
No, I shouldn't have to go through all that

[Hook]
You'll do fine with just one
Why you gotta be so selfish?
Why you gotta be so selfish?
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna get what's mine back
Never mind that
You don't need two hearts
(You stole my heart, give it back to me)

[Verse 3]
Can I rap to you real quick?
I put what's left of my heart into this track
In hoping you'd feel it, damn
Real shit, it took a while to build this
And you still be talking that bullshit
Even though you not around, ventriloquist
You know better, that's off limits
Leave it alone before you break it
Maybe if you knew better, I might let you
But I know you won't hold it safely
Girl, you do know you got my heart
Please tell me what you need two for
To my health, girl, that's crucial
That's why I say I can't lose... you

So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body

403,Don't Rush Me,"[Intro: Jean Grae]
9th, 9th's got them beats that you just sing to for no reason
{*laughs*}
Sometimes you got to get to know yourself
You gotta travel a little bit
Look at yourself from another perspective
So I try to do that
Come on

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
Listen, there's nothing like knowin' yourself
Like the way I know that the smoke has kind of broken my health
Like the way I know my flow don't make appropriate wealth
I can't change that
But, funny I'm sayin' that when it's money I'm aimed at
I give a fuck if you frame that or quote it (shit)
I meant what I said 'cause I wrote it—point noted
I know I'm overly sensitive when it comes to, well
Just about everything
And I'm so hardheaded—I don't need your help
Like no advice for these records 'less it's me and myself
Like, I don't ever want to breathe if it requires assistance
Just, just shut down my system
I'm a victim of choosin' bad love, bad luck Lucy
Every man touched seems to be a doozy and plus
I'm attached to this looseleaf, stand on my two feet
So it's hard enough to even have to physically move me
Go ahead, try

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga (just try)
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me (hey, get your hand off me, man)
Don't rush me (you stupid?  I'll cut you)

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
I gotta be more disciplined
I'm listenin' more to straight logic, blocking random shit that's drifting in
Age is a motherfucker (damn right)
Find myself staring at the little kids, thinking ""I can beat 'em like a stepmother""
Creeping on a come-up at thirty soon
But looking twenty, ooh
The food catches up to you now plenty
Attending christenings of my best friend's children
And then asking who's next
And I'm wishing for six more wishes for Christmas or
Kids on the wish list
Or time machines to be in existence
I'm a team player—not (nope)
The dry wit is similar to Arizona weather.  Say it, nigga—""Hot""
Patent leather sole, tappin' at my bowl
If the album's not platinum, then I'll have to rack a gold
This rappin' ain't for nothin'
Unless I hold plaques so I can sit up on a boat like Colin, roll that
And you know that

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me (hey, didn't I just tell you?)
Don't rush me (fall back, nigga)

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
See, this here is the most serious that I've ever been
The most clear headed
My gear fetish clearly needs an account
So if I need, I'll smoke 'em all like Dennis Leary and I'm out
Beef's great though, thanks for addin' more insecurities
Just as I was findin' my level of maturity
Just as I was mindin' my business, tried to murder Jean's confidence
But lucky for me, you're all incompetent
Road block in this, yes
I see 'em tryna put a stop to my obnoxiousness but
I stay long-winded like sayin', ""George Papadopoulous""
I know but I write from this heart with this
So, I've got some things to work on
My moodiness like masturbation—gets its jerk on
My fascination with the fast pace
The money's encapsulated in my mind space like ""What a thrill""
Past dated and I know I'm not in last place
But it's hard to work through it with this masked face
And masking tape up on the window keeps the cold out
And every time I'm laying down, my back breaks because it's old now
I yell too much, get stressed too quick
But the best thing about it—I can change that shit
And still remain who I came down to Earth to be
It's not Jean Grae—that's just a name, you'll see

[Hook: Jean Grae]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me
Don't rush me

[Outro: Jean Grae]
Please don't make me kill you, I don't want to
I don't need to go to jail right now
I got things to do
Can't be locked up, man
My momma, my momma
No momma.  No, no
Anyway, yo, thanks man
Thank you 9th
And we had a beautiful lunch
Don't be afraid to talk in the back

They're bringing back the old rules to please the few

Get down and get to work
High, high, we're high and dry
And we're dancing in the dirt

Chorus
I'm going to shake for the sheik
'till I feel my body break
I've got reds in the bed
Hear them dancing in my heed
Going to shake for the sheik
'till I feel my body break
I've got the blues - bad news
My heart's dropped down to my shoes
Yeah yeah

From the holy temples of Beruit
To the factories of Japan
Got to shine your shoes and hide your loot
And get rich while you can
There's a red neck rapping at my door
With bibles and grenades
And fighting for a one man's war
In bad black mirror shades

Fat cats big ass rats
Jumping to the beat
Black, black oil
And crack

Give me the keys, I'll drive you out of your mind
Give me the keys, and I'll drive you crazy
Give me the keys, I'll drive you out of your mind

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few

Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground

414,Cross My Heart,"[Hook: Preeya Kalidas and (Skepta)]
Strobe lights flashing in my eyes
Living for this moment, now I realise
I'll never tell a lie lie lie
I'll never let them in, I leave them on the outside (Boy Better Know)
I promise you, I promise you, yeah (the truth)
I promise you, I promise you, yeah (Skepta)
Cross my heart until the day I die

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I've been around the world and back
Screaming more money, more paper
Been doing it major
Even Walkers ain't got this much flavour
They say I'm super bad like McLovin
Now man are calling me family all of a sudden
And I'm like ""Mum, how come you never told me that I had all these cousins?""
This corner I'm standing in, never felt claustrophobic when I came in 10 minutes ago
Now my backs against the wall
It's a good job I'm tall
So I can always see clear
Even with all the smoke in the air
I know some are standing here cause of loving fame
But a lot of them are here out of fear

Cross my heart until the day I die

[Verse 2: Skepta]
It's time to go straight back to the top with them
They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again
And all my real friends know I'm a still keep it 10 multiplied by 10
Forgive me if I've been acting a little strange
I never ever knew that one song could make my whole life change
Last week I boarded six planes
But I can't complain, this is the moment I've been waiting for
Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door
I'm with Boy Better Know let them all in
But there's a flip side to all things
So before you sign yourself up to the high life
Make sure you read the small print
Please
Listen to me when I'm talking
The guy you're looking at right now is the guy I was this morning
I never had a pen but I made a mark
Even when I top the chart, I'll be the same guy that I was at the start
I hope to die I cross my heart

416,Look Away,"[Verse 1]
Two eyes staring back at me
From a magazine in my room
Cut out paper tragedies
Paper tragedies that I glue
Show up cause of memory

Creating a fantasy
Something I can dream
That is true

I will only look away
If you say

I will only look away
If you say

I don't see it
Another message left for me in code
Hieroglyphics
I never figured out how to
Unfold your paper crane's origami agony
I ripped the edges
It gave me pleasure
Figuring it out
Each question in a shroud
It's been forever, wasn't forever

Now when I close my eyes I see how much I've lost
From scratching a memory 'til all the colors off
Revealing a jagged line still there in black and white
When I close my eyes
If I close my eyes
But I can't laugh about it yet
It's all too soon
The things we used to joke about have all come true
I had to slowly back away

428,Giving You The Best That I Got,"[Verse 1]
Ain't there something I can give you?
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind
And make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out of reach

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together
We can calm a stormy sea

[Hook]
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes, I tell you now
That I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again

[Hook]
We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me
Said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got

[Bridge]
Listen, baby
Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own
Now I'm home

[Verse 3]
My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone
I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

[Hook]
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got

Listen, baby
I bet everything on my wedding ring
I'm giving you the best that I got
Giving it to you, baby

429,The Promise,"[Verse 1]
If you need a friend
Don't look to a stranger
You know in the end, I'll always be there
But when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around, and I'll be there

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you I will

[Verse 2]
When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do
I'm gonna always be there
Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out
With no cross to bear

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you I will

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

[Bridge]
I gotta tell you
Need to tell you
Gotta tell you
I've gotta tell you

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will
I will
I will",When in Rome,1989,"[87, 79, 64, 54, 49, 36, 29]",7

Old T-Bird car, baby

Comes on real slick
Heard enough about sin, girl
Gonna make it stick
Hey! What makes him so special anyhow?

She said, ""So good lookin', that's a fact
Steel guitar slung across his back""
The girls all know he's Way Cool Jr

Check him out on his good side

Heard he came from Memphis
Somewhere down south
Started hangin' with the blues crowd
That's how he got that crazy sound
What is all this talkin' goin' round?

Out all night, keeps me up 'til dawn""

Can't keep the fortune without the fame

433,Walk On Water,"[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilin' like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling ""Fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling ""Fuck me""
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me

Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam

Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned

God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass

I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking

And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking

438,Back On Holiday,"It's quarter to nine
So tired I can barely move

No one's at work on time
I'll be there in an hour or two
Five days a week is absurd
A few days off in his crazy world
Is something I could use
I'm going -

Back on holiday
Isn't it time we had a vacation?
Back on holiday
Need a little rest and relaxation!

Pick up the phone
Tell the boss I'm not coming in

I'm busy taking it slow
No time to waste in a traffic jam
Morning
Noon and night I think I've paid my dues

Pack my bags and I'm ready to make my getaway
I'm going -

Back on holiday
Isn't it time we had a vacation?...

You know that sometimes life can turn into all work and no play

So if you feel like you need it just go back on holiday

Five days a week is absurd
A few days off in this crazy world
Is something I could use

439,Posse On Broadway,"[Verse 1]
Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz limo with the cellular phone
I'm calling up the posse it's time to get rippin
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin
Everybody's looking if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumping but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rolling Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this sucka mc's wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Heading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back
Maharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass, the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 2]
Rollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot a money
Clocking lots a dollars, we all got gold
Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go
Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs
Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop
The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best
She's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 3]
Cruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rolling with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was looking for a ride
We tried to pick em up but we had no room inside
We put em on the trunk we put em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks
My muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak
Now the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip
They said, ""Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's""
Dick's is the place were the cool hang out
The swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
We're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace
Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us
With him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes
You're broke cold crying about the rock man blues
Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset

House
House

[Interlude]

[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
I get out of bed at half past ten
Phone up a friend who's a party animal
Turn on the news and drink some tea
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
One day I'll read or learn to drive a car
If you pass the test you can beat the rest
But I don't like to compete or talk street, street, street
I can pick up the best from the party animal

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would

[Verse 3: Neil Tennant]
Pick up a brochure about the sun
Learn to ignore what the photographer saw
I was always told that you should join a club
Stick with the gang if you want to belong

[Verse 4: Neil Tennant]
I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy
In a world of my own at the back of the garden
I didn't want to compete or play out on the street
For in a secret life I was a roundhead general

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would
Oh, I would

[Bridge: Neil Tennant]
I was faced with a choice at a difficult age
Would I write a book or should I take to the stage?
But in the back of my head I heard distant feet
Ché Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat

[Verse 5: Neil Tennant]
It's not a crime when you look the way you do
The way I like to picture you
When I get home it's late at night
I pour a drink and watch the fight

[Verse 6: Neil Tennant]
Turn off the TV, look at a book
Pick up the phone, fix some food
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day
Waiting for the minute I hear you say

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Come on, baby, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would
Come on, baby
Left to my own devices, I probably would

[Interlude]

[Verse 7: Neil Tennant]
Out of bed at half past ten
The party animal phones a friend
Picks up news about the sun
And the working day has just begun

[Interlude]

[Verse 8: Neil Tennant]
Sticks with the gang at the back of the street
Pass the test and you don't compete

[Verse 9: Neil Tennant]
Drive the car if you're with me
Ché Guevara's drinking tea
He reads about a new device
And takes to the stage in a secret life

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Left to my own devices, I probably would
If I was left to my own devices, I possibly would
If I was left to my own devices, I probably would
If I was left to my own devices, I probably would

I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try

446,"Wild Again (From ""Cocktail"")","SOME OF THE CADDIES were poor as sin and lived in one-room houses with a neurasthenic cow in the front yard, but Dexter Green's father owned the second best grocery-store in Black Bear--the best one was ""The Hub,"" patronized by the wealthy people from Sherry Island--and Dexter caddied only for pocket-money.
In the fall when the days became crisp and gray, and the long Minnesota winter shut down like the white lid of a box, Dexter's skis moved over the snow that hid the fairways of the golf course. At these times the country gave him a feeling of profound melancholy--it offended him that the links should lie in enforced fallowness, haunted by ragged sparrows for the long season. It was dreary, too, that on the tees where the gay colors fluttered in summer there were now only the desolate sand-boxes knee-deep in crusted ice. When he crossed the hills the wind blew cold as misery, and if the sun was out he tramped with his eyes squinted up against the hard dimensionless glare.

In April the winter ceased abruptly. The snow ran down into Black Bear Lake scarcely tarrying for the early golfers to brave the season with red and black balls. Without elation, without an interval of moist glory, the cold was gone.

Dexter knew that there was something dismal about this Northern spring, just as he knew there was something gorgeous about the fall. Fall made him clinch his hands and tremble and repeat idiotic sentences to himself, and make brisk abrupt gestures of command to imaginary audiences and armies. October filled him with hope which November raised to a sort of ecstatic triumph, and in this mood the fleeting brilliant impressions of the summer at Sherry Island were ready grist to his mill. He became a golf champion and defeated Mr. T. A. Hedrick in a marvellous match played a hundred times over the fairways of his imagination, a match each detail of which he changed about untiringly--sometimes he won with almost laughable ease, sometimes he came up magnificently from behind. Again, stepping from a Pierce-Arrow automobile, like Mr. Mortimer Jones, he strolled frigidly into the lounge of the Sherry Island Golf Club-- or perhaps, surrounded by an admiring crowd, he gave an exhibition of fancy diving from the spring-board of the club raft. . . . Among those who watched him in open-mouthed wonder was Mr. Mortimer Jones.

And one day it came to pass that Mr. Jones--himself and not his ghost-- came up to Dexter with tears in his eyes and said that Dexter was the----best caddy in the club, and wouldn't he decide not to quit if Mr. Jones made it worth his while, because every other caddy in the club lost one ball a hole for him-- regularly----

""No, sir,"" said Dexter decisively, ""I don't want to caddy any more."" Then, after a pause: ""I'm too old.""

""You're not more than fourteen. Why the devil did you decide just this morning that you wanted to quit? You promised that next week you'd go over to the State tournament with me.""

""I decided I was too old.""

Dexter handed in his ""A Class"" badge, collected what money was due him from the caddy master, and walked home to Black Bear Village.

""The best----caddy I ever saw,"" shouted Mr. Mortimer Jones over a drink that afternoon. ""Never lost a ball! Willing! Intelligent! Quiet! Honest! Grateful!""

The little girl who had done this was eleven--beautifully ugly as little girls are apt to be who are destined after a few years to be inexpressibly lovely and bring no end of misery to a great number of men. The spark, however, was perceptible. There was a general ungodliness in the way her lips twisted ,down at the corners when she smiled, and in the--Heaven help us!--in the almost passionate quality of her eyes. Vitality is born early in such women. It was utterly in evidence now, shining through her thin frame in a sort of glow.

She had come eagerly out on to the course at nine o'clock with a white linen nurse and five small new golf-clubs in a white canvas bag which the nurse was carrying. When Dexter first saw her she was standing by the caddy house, rather ill at ease and trying to conceal the fact by engaging her nurse in an obviously unnatural conversation graced by startling and irrelevant grimaces from herself.

""Well, it's certainly a nice day, Hilda,"" Dexter heard her say. She drew down the corners of her mouth, smiled, and glanced furtively around, her eyes in transit falling for an instant on Dexter.

Then to the nurse:

""Well, I guess there aren't very many people out here this morning, are there?""

The smile again--radiant, blatantly artificial--convincing.

""I don't know what we're supposed to do now,"" said the nurse, looking nowhere in particular.

""Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it up.

Dexter stood perfectly still, his mouth slightly ajar. He knew that if he moved forward a step his stare would be in her line of vision--if he moved backward he would lose his full view of her face. For a moment he had not realized how young she was. Now he remembered having seen her several times the year before in bloomers.

Suddenly, involuntarily, he laughed, a short abrupt laugh-- then, startled by himself, he turned and began to walk quickly away.

""Boy!""

Dexter stopped.

""Boy----""

Beyond question he was addressed. Not only that, but he was treated to that absurd smile, that preposterous smile--the memory of which at least a dozen men were to carry into middle age.

""Boy, do you know where the golf teacher is?""

""He's giving a lesson.""

""Well, do you know where the caddy-master is?""

""He isn't here yet this morning.""

""Oh."" For a moment this baffled her. She stood alternately on her right and left foot.

""We'd like to get a caddy,"" said the nurse. ""Mrs. Mortimer Jones sent us out to play golf, and we don't know how without we get a caddy.""

Here she was stopped by an ominous glance from Miss Jones, followed immediately by the smile.

""There aren't any caddies here except me,"" said Dexter to the nurse, ""and I got to stay here in charge until the caddy-master gets here.""

""Oh.""

Miss Jones and her retinue now withdrew, and at a proper distance from Dexter became involved in a heated conversation, which was concluded by Miss Jones taking one of the clubs and hitting it on the ground with violence. For further emphasis she raised it again and was about to bring it down smartly upon the nurse's bosom, when the nurse seized the club and twisted it from her hands.

""You damn little mean old thing!"" cried Miss Jones wildly.

Another argument ensued. Realizing that the elements of the comedy were implied in the scene, Dexter several times began to laugh, but each time restrained the laugh before it reached audibility. He could not resist the monstrous conviction that the little girl was justified in beating the nurse.

The situation was resolved by the fortuitous appearance of the caddymaster, who was appealed to immediately by the nurse.

""Miss Jones is to have a little caddy, and this one says he can't go.""

""Mr. McKenna said I was to wait here till you came,"" said Dexter quickly.

""Well, he's here now."" Miss Jones smiled cheerfully at the caddy-master. Then she dropped her bag and set off at a haughty mince toward the first tee.

""Well?"" The caddy-master turned to Dexter. ""What you standing there like a dummy for? Go pick up the young lady's clubs.""

""I don't think I'll go out to-day,"" said Dexter.

""You don't----""

""I think I'll quit.""

The enormity of his decision frightened him. He was a favorite caddy, and the thirty dollars a month he earned through the summer were not to be made elsewhere around the lake. But he had received a strong emotional shock, and his perturbation required a violent and immediate outlet.

It is not so simple as that, either. As so frequently would be the case in the future, Dexter was unconsciously dictated to by his winter dreams.

II

NOW, OF COURSE, the quality and the seasonability of these winter dreams varied, but the stuff of them remained. They persuaded Dexter several years later to pass up a business course at the State university--his father, prospering now, would have paid his way--for the precarious advantage of attending an older and more famous university in the East, where he was bothered by his scanty funds. But do not get the impression, because his winter dreams happened to be concerned at first with musings on the rich, that there was anything merely snobbish in the boy. He wanted not association with glittering things and glittering people--he wanted the glittering things themselves. Often he reached out for the best without knowing why he wanted it--and sometimes he ran up against the mysterious denials and prohibitions in which life indulges. It is with one of those denials and not with his career as a whole that this story deals.
He made money. It was rather amazing. After college he went to the city from which Black Bear Lake draws its wealthy patrons. When he was only twenty-three and had been there not quite two years, there were already people who liked to say: ""Now there's a boy--"" All about him rich men's sons were peddling bonds precariously, or investing patrimonies precariously, or plodding through the two dozen volumes of the ""George Washington Commercial Course,"" but Dexter borrowed a thousand dollars on his college degree and his confident mouth, and bought a partnership in a laundry.

It was a small laundry when he went into it but Dexter made a specialty of learning how the English washed fine woollen golf-stockings without shrinking them, and within a year he was catering to the trade that wore knickerbockers. Men were insisting that their Shetland hose and sweaters go to his laundry just as they had insisted on a caddy who could find golfballs. A little later he was doing their wives' lingerie as well--and running five branches in different parts of the city. Before he was twenty-seven he owned the largest string of laundries in his section of the country. It was then that he sold out and went to New York. But the part of his story that concerns us goes back to the days when he was making his first big success.

When he was twenty-three Mr. Hart--one of the gray-haired men who like to say ""Now there's a boy""--gave him a guest card to the Sherry Island Golf Club for a week-end. So he signed his name one day on the register, and that afternoon played golf in a foursome with Mr. Hart and Mr. Sandwood and Mr. T. A. Hedrick. He did not consider it necessary to remark that he had once carried Mr. Hart's bag over this same links, and that he knew every trap and gully with his eyes shut--but he found himself glancing at the four caddies who trailed them, trying to catch a gleam or gesture that would remind him of himself, that would lessen the gap which lay between his present and his past.

It was a curious day, slashed abruptly with fleeting, familiar impressions. One minute he had the sense of being a trespasser--in the next he was impressed by the tremendous superiority he felt toward Mr. T. A. Hedrick, who was a bore and not even a good golfer any more.

Then, because of a ball Mr. Hart lost near the fifteenth green, an enormous thing happened. While they were searching the stiff grasses of the rough there was a clear call of ""Fore!"" from behind a hill in their rear. And as they all turned abruptly from their search a bright new ball sliced abruptly over the hill and caught Mr. T. A. Hedrick in the abdomen.

""By Gad!"" cried Mr. T. A. Hedrick, ""they ought to put some of these crazy women off the course. It's getting to be outrageous.""

A head and a voice came up together over the hill:

""Do you mind if we go through?""

""You hit me in the stomach!"" declared Mr. Hedrick wildly.

""Did I?"" The girl approached the group of men. ""I'm sorry. I yelled 'Fore !'""

Her glance fell casually on each of the men--then scanned the fairway for her ball.

""Did I bounce into the rough?""

It was impossible to determine whether this question was ingenuous or malicious. In a moment, however, she left no doubt, for as her partner came up over the hill she called cheerfully:

""Here I am! I'd have gone on the green except that I hit something.""

As she took her stance for a short mashie shot, Dexter looked at her closely. She wore a blue gingham dress, rimmed at throat and shoulders with a white edging that accentuated her tan. The quality of exaggeration, of thinness, which had made her passionate eyes and down-turning mouth absurd at eleven, was gone now. She was arrestingly beautiful. The color in her cheeks was centered like the color in a picture--it was not a ""high"" color, but a sort of fluctuating and feverish warmth, so shaded that it seemed at any moment it would recede and disappear. This color and the mobility of her mouth gave a continual impression of flux, of intense life, of passionate vitality--balanced only partially by the sad luxury of her eyes.

She swung her mashie impatiently and without interest, pitching the ball into a sand-pit on the other side of the green. With a quick, insincere smile and a careless ""Thank you!"" she went on after it.

""That Judy Jones!"" remarked Mr. Hedrick on the next tee, as they waited--some moments--for her to play on ahead. ""All she needs is to be turned up and spanked for six months and then to be married off to an oldfashioned cavalry captain.""

""My God, she's good-looking!"" said Mr. Sandwood, who was just over thirty.

""Good-looking!"" cried Mr. Hedrick contemptuously, ""she always looks as if she wanted to be kissed! Turning those big cow-eyes on every calf in town!""

It was doubtful if Mr. Hedrick intended a reference to the maternal instinct.

""She'd play pretty good golf if she'd try,"" said Mr. Sandwood.

""She has no form,"" said Mr. Hedrick solemnly.

""She has a nice figure,"" said Mr. Sandwood.

""Better thank the Lord she doesn't drive a swifter ball,"" said Mr. Hart, winking at Dexter.

Later in the afternoon the sun went down with a riotous swirl of gold and varying blues and scarlets, and left the dry, rustling night of Western summer. Dexter watched from the veranda of the Golf Club, watched the even overlap of the waters in the little wind, silver molasses under the harvest-moon. Then the moon held a finger to her lips and the lake became a clear pool, pale and quiet. Dexter put on his bathing-suit and swam out to the farthest raft, where he stretched dripping on the wet canvas of the springboard.

There was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. Over on a dark peninsula a piano was playing the songs of last summer and of summers before that-- songs from ""Chin-Chin"" and ""The Count of Luxemburg"" and ""The Chocolate Soldier""--and because the sound of a piano over a stretch of water had always seemed beautiful to Dexter he lay perfectly quiet and listened.

The tune the piano was playing at that moment had been gay and new five years before when Dexter was a sophomore at college. They had played it at a prom once when he could not afford the luxury of proms, and he had stood outside the gymnasium and listened. The sound of the tune precipitated in him a sort of ecstasy and it was with that ecstasy he viewed what happened to him now. It was a mood of intense appreciation, a sense that, for once, he was magnificently attune to life and that everything about him was radiating a brightness and a glamour he might never know again.

A low, pale oblong detached itself suddenly from the darkness of the Island, spitting forth the reverberate sound of a racing motor-boat. Two white streamers of cleft water rolled themselves out behind it and almost immediately the boat was beside him, drowning out the hot tinkle of the piano in the drone of its spray. Dexter raising himself on his arms was aware of a figure standing at the wheel, of two dark eyes regarding him over the lengthening space of water--then the boat had gone by and was sweeping in an immense and purposeless circle of spray round and round in the middle of the lake. With equal eccentricity one of the circles flattened out and headed back toward the raft.

""Who's that?"" she called, shutting off her motor. She was so near now that Dexter could see her bathing-suit, which consisted apparently of pink rompers.

The nose of the boat bumped the raft, and as the latter tilted rakishly he was precipitated toward her. With different degrees of interest they recognized each other.

""Aren't you one of those men we played through this afternoon?"" she demanded.

He was.

""Well, do you know how to drive a motor-boat? Because if you do I wish you'd drive this one so I can ride on the surf-board behind. My name is Judy Jones""--she favored him with an absurd smirk--rather, what tried to be a smirk, for, twist her mouth as she might, it was not grotesque, it was merely beautiful--""and I live in a house over there on the Island, and in that house there is a man waiting for me. When he drove up at the door I drove out of the dock because he says I'm his ideal.""

There was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. Dexter sat beside Judy Jones and she explained how her boat was driven. Then she was in the water, swimming to the floating surfboard with a sinuous crawl. Watching her was without effort to the eye, watching a branch waving or a sea-gull flying. Her arms, burned to butternut, moved sinuously among the dull platinum ripples, elbow appearing first, casting the forearm back with a cadence of falling water, then reaching out and down, stabbing a path ahead.

They moved out into the lake; turning, Dexter saw that she was kneeling on the low rear of the now uptilted surf-board.

""Go faster,"" she called, ""fast as it'll go.""

Obediently he jammed the lever forward and the white spray mounted at the bow. When he looked around again the girl was standing up on the rushing board, her arms spread wide, her eyes lifted toward the moon.

""It's awful cold,"" she shouted. ""What's your name?""

He told her.

""Well, why don't you come to dinner to-morrow night?""

His heart turned over like the fly-wheel of the boat, and, for the second time, her casual whim gave a new direction to his life.

III

NEXT EVENING while he waited for her to come down-stairs, Dexter peopled the soft deep summer room and the sun-porch that opened from it with the men who had already loved Judy Jones. He knew the sort of men they were--the men who when he first went to college had entered from the great prep schools with graceful clothes and the deep tan of healthy summers. He had seen that, in one sense, he was better than these men. He was newer and stronger. Yet in acknowledging to himself that he wished his children to be like them he was admitting that he was but the rough, strong stuff from which they eternally sprang.
When the time had come for him to wear good clothes, he had known who were the best tailors in America, and the best tailors in America had made him the suit he wore this evening. He had acquired that particular reserve peculiar to his university, that set it off from other universities. He recognized the value to him of such a mannerism and he had adopted it; he knew that to be careless in dress and manner required more confidence than to be careful. But carelessness was for his children. His mother's name had been Krimslich. She was a Bohemian of the peasant class and she had talked broken English to the end of her days. Her son must keep to the set patterns.

At a little after seven Judy Jones came down-stairs. She wore a blue silk afternoon dress, and he was disappointed at first that she had not put on something more elaborate. This feeling was accentuated when, after a brief greeting, she went to the door of a butler's pantry and pushing it open called: ""You can serve dinner, Martha."" He had rather expected that a butler would announce dinner, that there would be a cocktail. Then he put these thoughts behind him as they sat down side by side on a lounge and looked at each other.

""Father and mother won't be here,"" she said thoughtfully.

He remembered the last time he had seen her father, and he was glad the parents were not to be here to-night--they might wonder who he was. He had been born in Keeble, a Minnesota village fifty miles farther north, and he always gave Keeble as his home instead of Black Bear Village. Country towns were well enough to come from if they weren't inconveniently in sight and used as footstools by fashionable lakes.

They talked of his university, which she had visited frequently during the past two years, and of the near-by city which supplied Sherry Island with its patrons, and whither Dexter would return next day to his prospering laundries.

During dinner she slipped into a moody depression which gave Dexter a feeling of uneasiness. Whatever petulance she uttered in her throaty voice worried him. Whatever she smiled at--at him, at a chicken liver, at nothing--it disturbed him that her smile could have no root in mirth, or even in amusement. When the scarlet corners of her lips curved down, it was less a smile than an invitation to a kiss.

Then, after dinner, she led him out on the dark sun-porch and deliberately changed the atmosphere.

""Do you mind if I weep a little?"" she said.

""I'm afraid I'm boring you,"" he responded quickly.

""You're not. I like you. But I've just had a terrible afternoon. There was a man I cared about, and this afternoon he told me out of a clear sky that he was poor as a church-mouse. He'd never even hinted it before. Does this sound horribly mundane?""

""Perhaps he was afraid to tell you.""

""Suppose he was,"" she answered. ""He didn't start right. You see, if I'd thought of him as poor--well, I've been mad about loads of poor men, and fully intended to marry them all. But in this case, I hadn't thought of him that way, and my interest in him wasn't strong enough to survive the shock. As if a girl calmly informed her fianc_ that she was a widow. He might not object to widows, but----

""Let's start right,"" she interrupted herself suddenly. ""Who are you, anyhow?""

For a moment Dexter hesitated. Then:

""I'm nobody,"" he announced. ""My career is largely a matter of futures.""

""Are you poor?""

""No,"" he said frankly, ""I'm probably making more money than any man my age in the Northwest. I know that's an obnoxious remark, but you advised me to start right.""

There was a pause. Then she smiled and the corners of her mouth drooped and an almost imperceptible sway brought her closer to him, looking up into his eyes. A lump rose in Dexter's throat, and he waited breathless for the experiment, facing the unpredictable compound that would form mysteriously from the elements of their lips. Then he saw--she communicated her excitement to him, lavishly, deeply, with kisses that were not a promise but a fulfillment. They aroused in him not hunger demanding renewal but surfeit that would demand more surfeit . . . kisses that were like charity, creating want by holding back nothing at all.

It did not take him many hours to decide that he had wanted Judy Jones ever since he was a proud, desirous little boy.

IV

IT BEGAN like that--and continued, with varying shades of intensity, on such a note right up to the d_nouement. Dexter surrendered a part of himself to the most direct and unprincipled personality with which he had ever come in contact. Whatever Judy wanted, she went after with the full pressure of her charm. There was no divergence of method, no jockeying for position or premeditation of effects--there was a very little mental side to any of her affairs. She simply made men conscious to the highest degree of her physical loveliness. Dexter had no desire to change her. Her deficiencies were knit up with a passionate energy that transcended and justified them.
When, as Judy's head lay against his shoulder that first night, she whispered, ""I don't know what's the matter with me. Last night I thought I was in love with a man and to-night I think I'm in love with you----""--it seemed to him a beautiful and romantic thing to say. It was the exquisite excitability that for the moment he controlled and owned. But a week later he was compelled to view this same quality in a different light. She took him in her roadster to a picnic supper, and after supper she disappeared, likewise in her roadster, with another man. Dexter became enormously upset and was scarcely able to be decently civil to the other people present. When she assured him that she had not kissed the other man, he knew she was lying--yet he was glad that she had taken the trouble to lie to him.

He was, as he found before the summer ended, one of a varying dozen who circulated about her. Each of them had at one time been favored above all others--about half of them still basked in the solace of occasional sentimental revivals. Whenever one showed signs of dropping out through long neglect, she granted him a brief honeyed hour, which encouraged him to tag along for a year or so longer. Judy made these forays upon the helpless and defeated without malice, indeed half unconscious that there was anything mischievous in what she did.

When a new man came to town every one dropped out--dates were automatically cancelled.

The helpless part of trying to do anything about it was that she did it all herself. She was not a girl who could be ""won"" in the kinetic sense--she was proof against cleverness, she was proof against charm; if any of these assailed her too strongly she would immediately resolve the affair to a physical basis, and under the magic of her physical splendor the strong as well as the brilliant played her game and not their own. She was entertained only by the gratification of her desires and by the direct exercise of her own charm. Perhaps from so much youthful love, so many youthful lovers, she had come, in self-defense, to nourish herself wholly from within.

Succeeding Dexter's first exhilaration came restlessness and dissatisfaction. The helpless ecstasy of losing himself in her was opiate rather than tonic. It was fortunate for his work during the winter that those moments of ecstasy came infrequently. Early in their acquaintance it had seemed for a while that there was a deep and spontaneous mutual attraction that first August, for example--three days of long evenings on her dusky veranda, of strange wan kisses through the late afternoon, in shadowy alcoves or behind the protecting trellises of the garden arbors, of mornings when she was fresh as a dream and almost shy at meeting him in the clarity of the rising day. There was all the ecstasy of an engagement about it, sharpened by his realization that there was no engagement. It was during those three days that, for the first time, he had asked her to marry him. She said ""maybe some day,"" she said ""kiss me,"" she said ""I'd like to marry you,"" she said ""I love you""--she said-- nothing.

The three days were interrupted by the arrival of a New York man who visited at her house for half September. To Dexter's agony, rumor engaged them. The man was the son of the president of a great trust company. But at the end of a month it was reported that Judy was yawning. At a dance one night she sat all evening in a motor-boat with a local beau, while the New Yorker searched the club for her frantically. She told the local beau that she was bored with her visitor, and two days later he left. She was seen with him at the station, and it was reported that he looked very mournful indeed.

On this note the summer ended. Dexter was twenty-four, and he found himself increasingly in a position to do as he wished. He joined two clubs in the city and lived at one of them. Though he was by no means an integral part of the stag-lines at these clubs, he managed to be on hand at dances where Judy Jones was likely to appear. He could have gone out socially as much as he liked--he was an eligible young man, now, and popular with down-town fathers. His confessed devotion to Judy Jones had rather solidified his position. But he had no social aspirations and rather despised the dancing men who were always on tap for the Thursday or Saturday parties and who filled in at dinners with the younger married set. Already he was playing with the idea of going East to New York. He wanted to take Judy Jones with him. No disillusion as to the world in which she had grown up could cure his illusion as to her desirability.

Remember that--for only in the light of it can what he did for her be understood.

Eighteen months after he first met Judy Jones he became engaged to another girl. Her name was Irene Scheerer, and her father was one of the men who had always believed in Dexter. Irene was light-haired and sweet and honorable, and a little stout, and she had two suitors whom she pleasantly relinquished when Dexter formally asked her to marry him.

Summer, fall, winter, spring, another summer, another fall-- so much he had given of his active life to the incorrigible lips of Judy Jones. She had treated him with interest, with encouragement, with malice, with indifference, with contempt. She had inflicted on him the innumerable little slights and indignities possible in such a case--as if in revenge for having ever cared for him at all. She had beckoned him and yawned at him and beckoned him again and he had responded often with bitterness and narrowed eyes. She had brought him ecstatic happiness and intolerable agony of spirit. She had caused him untold inconvenience and not a little trouble. She had insulted him, and she had ridden over him, and she had played his interest in her against his interest in his work--for fun. She had done everything to him except to criticise him--this she had not done-- it seemed to him only because it might have sullied the utter indifference she manifested and sincerely felt toward him.

When autumn had come and gone again it occurred to him that he could not have Judy Jones. He had to beat this into his mind but he convinced himself at last. He lay awake at night for a while and argued it over. He told himself the trouble and the pain she had caused him, he enumerated her glaring deficiencies as a wife. Then he said to himself that he loved her, and after a while he fell asleep. For a week, lest he imagined her husky voice over the telephone or her eyes opposite him at lunch, he worked hard and late, and at night he went to his office and plotted out his years.

At the end of a week he went to a dance and cut in on her once. For almost the first time since they had met he did not ask her to sit out with him or tell her that she was lovely. It hurt him that she did not miss these things--that was all. He was not jealous when he saw that there was a new man to-night. He had been hardened against jealousy long before.

He stayed late at the dance. He sat for an hour with Irene Scheerer and talked about books and about music. He knew very little about either. But he was beginning to be master of his own time now, and he had a rather priggish notion that he--the young and already fabulously successful Dexter Green--should know more about such things.

That was in October, when he was twenty-five. In January, Dexter and Irene became engaged. It was to be announced in June, and they were to be married three months later.

The Minnesota winter prolonged itself interminably, and it was almost May when the winds came soft and the snow ran down into Black Bear Lake at last. For the first time in over a year Dexter was enjoying a certain tranquility of spirit. Judy Jones had been in Florida, and afterward in Hot Springs, and somewhere she had been engaged, and somewhere she had broken it off. At first, when Dexter had definitely given her up, it had made him sad that people still linked them together and asked for news of her, but when he began to be placed at dinner next to Irene Scheerer people didn't ask him about her any more--they told him about her. He ceased to be an authority on her.

May at last. Dexter walked the streets at night when the darkness was damp as rain, wondering that so soon, with so little done, so much of ecstasy had gone from him. May one year back had been marked by Judy's poignant, unforgivable, yet forgiven turbulence--it had been one of those rare times when he fancied she had grown to care for him. That old penny's worth of happiness he had spent for this bushel of content. He knew that Irene would be no more than a curtain spread behind him, a hand moving among gleaming tea-cups, a voice calling to children . . . fire and loveliness were gone, the magic of nights and the wonder of the varying hours and seasons . . . slender lips, down-turning, dropping to his lips and bearing him up into a heaven of eyes. . . . The thing was deep in him. He was too strong and alive for it to die lightly.

In the middle of May when the weather balanced for a few days on the thin bridge that led to deep summer he turned in one night at Irene's house. Their engagement was to be announced in a week now--no one would be surprised at it. And to-night they would sit together on the lounge at the University Club and look on for an hour at the dancers. It gave him a sense of solidity to go with her--she was so sturdily popular, so intensely ""great.""

He mounted the steps of the brownstone house and stepped inside.

""Irene,"" he called.

Mrs. Scheerer came out of the living-room to meet him.

""Dexter,"" she said, ""Irene's gone up-stairs with a splitting headache. She wanted to go with you but I made her go to bed.""

""Nothing serious, I----""

""Oh, no. She's going to play golf with you in the morning. You can spare her for just one night, can't you, Dexter?""

Her smile was kind. She and Dexter liked each other. In the living-room he talked for a moment before he said good-night.

Returning to the University Club, where he had rooms, he stood in the doorway for a moment and watched the dancers. He leaned against the door-post, nodded at a man or two--yawned.

""Hello, darling.""

The familiar voice at his elbow startled him. Judy Jones had left a man and crossed the room to him--Judy Jones, a slender enamelled doll in cloth of gold: gold in a band at her head, gold in two slipper points at her dress's hem. The fragile glow of her face seemed to blossom as she smiled at him. A breeze of warmth and light blew through the room. His hands in the pockets of his dinner-jacket tightened spasmodically. He was filled with a sudden excitement.

""When did you get back?"" he asked casually.

""Come here and I'll tell you about it.""

She turned and he followed her. She had been away--he could have wept at the wonder of her return. She had passed through enchanted streets, doing things that were like provocative music. All mysterious happenings, all fresh and quickening hopes, had gone away with her, come back with her now.

She turned in the doorway.

""Have you a car here? If you haven't, I have.""

""I have a coup_.""

In then, with a rustle of golden cloth. He slammed the door. Into so many cars she had stepped--like this--like that-- her back against the leather, so--her elbow resting on the door-- waiting. She would have been soiled long since had there been anything to soil her--except herself--but this was her own self outpouring.

With an effort he forced himself to start the car and back into the street. This was nothing, he must remember. She had done this before, and he had put her behind him, as he would have crossed a bad account from his books.

He drove slowly down-town and, affecting abstraction, traversed the deserted streets of the business section, peopled here and there where a movie was giving out its crowd or where consumptive or pugilistic youth lounged in front of pool halls. The clink of glasses and the slap of hands on the bars issued from saloons, cloisters of glazed glass and dirty yellow light.

She was watching him closely and the silence was embarrassing, yet in this crisis he could find no casual word with which to profane the hour. At a convenient turning he began to zigzag back toward the University Club.

""Have you missed me?"" she asked suddenly.

""Everybody missed you.""

He wondered if she knew of Irene Scheerer. She had been back only a day--her absence had been almost contemporaneous with his engagement.

""What a remark!"" Judy laughed sadly--without sadness. She looked at him searchingly. He became absorbed in the dashboard.

""You're handsomer than you used to be,"" she said thoughtfully. ""Dexter, you have the most rememberable eyes.""

He could have laughed at this, but he did not laugh. It was the sort of thing that was said to sophomores. Yet it stabbed at him.

""I'm awfully tired of everything, darling."" She called every one darling, endowing the endearment with careless, individual comraderie. ""I wish you'd marry me.""

The directness of this confused him. He should have told her now that he was going to marry another girl, but he could not tell her. He could as easily have sworn that he had never loved her.

""I think we'd get along,"" she continued, on the same note, ""unless probably you've forgotten me and fallen in love with another girl.""

Her confidence was obviously enormous. She had said, in effect, that she found such a thing impossible to believe, that if it were true he had merely committed a childish indiscretion-- and probably to show off. She would forgive him, because it was not a matter of any moment but rather something to be brushed aside lightly.

""Of course you could never love anybody but me,"" she continued. ""I like the way you love me. Oh, Dexter, have you forgotten last year?""

""No, I haven't forgotten.""

""Neither have I! ""

Was she sincerely moved--or was she carried along by the wave of her own acting?

""I wish we could be like that again,"" she said, and he forced himself to answer:

""I don't think we can.""

""I suppose not. . . . I hear you're giving Irene Scheerer a violent rush.""

There was not the faintest emphasis on the name, yet Dexter was suddenly ashamed.

""Oh, take me home,"" cried Judy suddenly; ""I don't want to go back to that idiotic dance--with those children.""

Then, as he turned up the street that led to the residence district, Judy began to cry quietly to herself. He had never seen her cry before.

The dark street lightened, the dwellings of the rich loomed up around them, he stopped his coup_ in front of the great white bulk of the Mortimer Joneses house, somnolent, gorgeous, drenched with the splendor of the damp moonlight. Its solidity startled him. The strong walls, the steel of the girders, the breadth and beam and pomp of it were there only to bring out the contrast with the young beauty beside him. It was sturdy to accentuate her slightness--as if to show what a breeze could be generated by a butterfly's wing.

He sat perfectly quiet, his nerves in wild clamor, afraid that if he moved he would find her irresistibly in his arms. Two tears had rolled down her wet face and trembled on her upper lip.

""I'm more beautiful than anybody else,"" she said brokenly, ""why can't I be happy?"" Her moist eyes tore at his stability--her mouth turned slowly downward with an exquisite sadness: ""I'd like to marry you if you'll have me, Dexter. I suppose you think I'm not worth having, but I'll be so beautiful for you, Dexter.""

A million phrases of anger, pride, passion, hatred, tenderness fought on his lips. Then a perfect wave of emotion washed over him, carrying off with it a sediment of wisdom, of convention, of doubt, of honor. This was his girl who was speaking, his own, his beautiful, his pride.

""Won't you come in?"" He heard her draw in her breath sharply.

Waiting.

""All right,"" his voice was trembling, ""I'll come in.

V

IT WAS STRANGE that neither when it was over nor a long time afterward did he regret that night. Looking at it from the perspective of ten years, the fact that Judy's flare for him endured just one month seemed of little importance. Nor did it matter that by his yielding he subjected himself to a deeper agony in the end and gave serious hurt to Irene Scheerer and to Irene's parents, who had befriended him. There was nothing sufficiently pictorial about Irene's grief to stamp itself on his mind.
Dexter was at bottom hard-minded. The attitude of the city on his action was of no importance to him, not because he was going to leave the city, but because any outside attitude on the situation seemed superficial. He was completely indifferent to popular opinion. Nor, when he had seen that it was no use, that he did not possess in himself the power to move fundamentally or to hold Judy Jones, did he bear any malice toward her. He loved her, and he would love her until the day he was too old for loving--but he could not have her. So he tasted the deep pain that is reserved only for the strong, just as he had tasted for a little while the deep happiness.

Even the ultimate falsity of the grounds upon which Judy terminated the engagement that she did not want to ""take him away"" from Irene--Judy, who had wanted nothing else--did not revolt him. He was beyond any revulsion or any amusement.

He went East in February with the intention of selling out his laundries and settling in New York--but the war came to America in March and changed his plans. He returned to the West, handed over the management of the business to his partner, and went into the first officers' training-camp in late April. He was one of those young thousands who greeted the war with a certain amount of relief, welcoming the liberation from webs of tangled emotion.

VI

THIS STORY is not his biography, remember, although things creep into it which have nothing to do with those dreams he had when he was young. We are almost done with them and with him now. There is only one more incident to be related here, and it happens seven years farther on.
It took place in New York, where he had done well--so well that there were no barriers too high for him. He was thirty-two years old, and, except for one flying trip immediately after the war, he had not been West in seven years. A man named Devlin from Detroit came into his office to see him in a business way, and then and there this incident occurred, and closed out, so to speak, this particular side of his life.

""So you're from the Middle West,"" said the man Devlin with careless curiosity. ""That's funny--I thought men like you were probably born and raised on Wall Street. You know--wife of one of my best friends in Detroit came from your city. I was an usher at the wedding.""

Dexter waited with no apprehension of what was coming.

""Judy Simms,"" said Devlin with no particular interest; ""Judy Jones she was once.""

""Yes, I knew her."" A dull impatience spread over him. He had heard, of course, that she was married--perhaps deliberately he had heard no more.

""Awfully nice girl,"" brooded Devlin meaninglessly, ""I'm sort of sorry for her.""

""Why?"" Something in Dexter was alert, receptive, at once.

""Oh, Lud Simms has gone to pieces in a way. I don't mean he ill-uses her, but he drinks and runs around ""

""Doesn't she run around?""

""No. Stays at home with her kids.""

""Oh.""

""She's a little too old for him,"" said Devlin.

""Too old!"" cried Dexter. ""Why, man, she's only twenty-seven.""

He was possessed with a wild notion of rushing out into the streets and taking a train to Detroit. He rose to his feet spasmodically.

""I guess you're busy,"" Devlin apologized quickly. ""I didn't realize----""

""No, I'm not busy,"" said Dexter, steadying his voice. ""I'm not busy at all. Not busy at all. Did you say she was-- twenty-seven? No, I said she was twenty-seven.""

""Yes, you did,"" agreed Devlin dryly.

""Go on, then. Go on.""

""What do you mean?""

""About Judy Jones.""

Devlin looked at him helplessly.

""Well, that's, I told you all there is to it. He treats her like the devil. Oh, they're not going to get divorced or anything. When he's particularly outrageous she forgives him. In fact, I'm inclined to think she loves him. She was a pretty girl when she first came to Detroit.""

A pretty girl! The phrase struck Dexter as ludicrous

""Isn't she--a pretty girl, any more?""

""Oh, she's all right.""

""Look here,"" said Dexter, sitting down suddenly, ""I don't understand. You say she was a 'pretty girl' and now you say she's 'all right.' I don't understand what you mean--Judy Jones wasn't a pretty girl, at all. She was a great beauty. Why, I knew her, I knew her. She was----""

Devlin laughed pleasantly.

""I'm not trying to start a row,"" he said. ""I think Judy's a nice girl and I like her. I can't understand how a man like Lud Simms could fall madly in love with her, but he did."" Then he added: ""Most of the women like her.""

Dexter looked closely at Devlin, thinking wildly that there must be a reason for this, some insensitivity in the man or some private malice.

""Lots of women fade just like that,"" Devlin snapped his fingers. ""You must have seen it happen. Perhaps I've forgotten how pretty she was at her wedding. I've seen her so much since then, you see. She has nice eyes.""

A sort of dulness settled down upon Dexter. For the first time in his life he felt like getting very drunk. He knew that he was laughing loudly at something Devlin had said, but he did not know what it was or why it was funny. When, in a few minutes, Devlin went he lay down on his lounge and looked out the window at the New York sky-line into which the sun was sinking in dull lovely shades of pink and gold.

He had thought that having nothing else to lose he was invulnerable at last--but he knew that he had just lost something more, as surely as if he had married Judy Jones and seen her fade away before his eyes.

The dream was gone. Something had been taken from him. In a sort of panic he pushed the palms of his hands into his eyes and tried to bring up a picture of the waters lapping on Sherry Island and the moonlit veranda, and gingham on the golf-links and the dry sun and the gold color of her neck's soft down. And her mouth damp to his kisses and her eyes plaintive with melancholy and her freshness like new fine linen in the morning. Why, these things were no longer in the world! They had existed and they existed no longer.

For the first time in years the tears were streaming down his face. But they were for himself now. He did not care about mouth and eyes and moving hands. He wanted to care, and he could not care. For he had gone away and he could never go back any more. The gates were closed, the sun was gone down, and there was no beauty but the gray beauty of steel that withstands all time. Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of illusion, of youth, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished.

""Long ago,"" he said, ""long ago, there was something in me, but now that thing is gone. Now that thing is gone, that thing is gone. I cannot cry. I cannot care. That thing will come back no more.""",F. Scott Fitzgerald,1989,"[97, 76, 73, 73, 76]",5
447,Bad Medicine,"[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count them, one, two, three

[Pre-Chorus]
First you need, that's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed, you get a little but it's never enough
On your knees, that's what you get for falling in love
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine)

[Verse 2]
I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, it doesn't leave a track
I've got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

[Pre-Chorus]
When you need, that's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed, you get a little but it's never enough
On your knees, that's what you get for falling in love
Now I'm addicted and your kiss is the drug

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I want
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I need

[Verse 3]
I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped is stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need

Your love's the potion that can cure my disease

448,Edge Of A Broken Heart,"[Verse 1]
And there I stood just like a soldier
I was tough until I saw her
I said hello but she just turned away
Hey Romeo, what are you doing with my girl?
Who are you using now? I turn and walk away
I'm going to please her
Now you can believe it
I'll be there to catch her when she falls

[Chorus]
Here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm a man (on the edge of a broken heart)
Here we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)
So run if you can because you know
I'm a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)

[Verse 2]
I'm on the outside, looking inside
You're with him, whose on the wrong side now?
Do you still think of me?
I've tried to call but no one answers
Two silhouettes, a private dancer
The lights go dim as the music starts to fade away
I'm the one who needs you
Now you can believe it
I'll be there to catch you when you fall

[Chorus]
You better believe I'm a man (on the edge of a broken heart)
Here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)
And we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)
So run if you can because you know
I'm a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)
I'm on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)

And when I hold out my hands
I'll be reaching for you
I give it all that I've got
That's all I can do
When you're waiting for love
I'll be waiting for you

451,Forever Young,"[Intro: Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)

I don't got no wheels to spin

With electric guitars no doubt
I don't care for anyone

You got your own thing going on
In places you don't belong

Only flesh so wolves can feed

And others have a lot to learn

I don't want to let my stomach squirm

At the right time we'll work it out
We'll be alright, I know it oh

You know, another thing that brings up some of these feeling is hallucinogens, which I know both of you have been doing, m'kay? So why don't you just sort of relax and maybe take this as an opportunity to meditate, m'kay? Go inside yourselves, look inward

460,"Don't Worry, Be Happy (From ""Cocktail"")","I’m pretty sure I have everything organised for the family before I walk out the door.

    Kids’ bags packed.

    Extra food prepared.

    Outdoor gear organised.

    Jordan and Elizabeth are going on their first wilderness expedition for a week with all the dads charged with helping out given the nature of outdoor activities they will be pursuing. Great idea from a mother’s perspective, but we all know in our hearts we will miss them from the first night they are away. The kids were devastated when the expedition was almost cancelled due to a lack of funding and support for the Tasmanian Wilderness Foundation. Thankfully, some last-minute sponsorship from the Fathers4Kids program enabled the expedition to take place after all. The kids are so excited. Actually when I think about it Robert, my husband, seems more awakened and engaged by this adventure than I have seen him in years. Must have something to do with men and their exploring tendencies — the mysteriousness of the confounding thylacine providing the perfect avenue — or maybe he is just happy to be away from me. Either way, he’s excited too and they haven’t been able to sleep in anticipation of the great adventure traversing the west coast of Tasmania’s wilderness in search of the elusive Tasmanian tiger.

    I’ve decided to make the most of the children’s absence from my life to complete a series of lectures I had been deferring for the last few months until the ‘time felt right’, so I’m preparing to fly to Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne to deliver my latest findings to postgraduate students, academics and other professionals in their given field of expertise.

    I now really need to focus on getting myself organised for the first lecture this afternoon in Sydney. Mentally, I go through my checklist — I have my notes, slides, discussion themes, workshop challenges, laptop and mobile phone, so all good. I am still fascinated by the research I have been conducting on visual stimulation and its impact on the development of perception and even now I find my mind wandering off and becoming lost in my work, considering a different spin on some of the provocative challenges I have developed for the lectures …

    All of a sudden, I become intensely aware of butterflies in my stomach, so much so, I have to lean against the kitchen bench to steady myself. I never usually get nervous before giving lectures, quite the opposite, as I really enjoy it. The challenge of engaging new minds, intellects sparring with one another on a quest for deeper, broader knowledge — fantastic! But where on earth are these butterflies coming from?

    I pause for a moment to investigate these feelings and attempt to locate their source, which might seem strange to some people, but it is something that has always intrigued me. They are more intense than usual, and it certainly isn’t the lecture making me feel this way. Perhaps it is the trip away from family. No, it is not as if I haven’t been away from them before, particularly for work purposes. I broaden my mindset to include the rest of the weekend when I stop suddenly — as my stomach flips again. I surprise myself as I instinctively inhale at the thought of my 5.00 p.m. meeting at the Hotel InterContinental with Jeremy.

    Doctor Jeremy Quinn. My uni buddy, my best friend, the man who opened my eyes and my body to the world in ways I never considered possible. He knew me inside and out when we were younger and we shared an incredible array of experiences during our time together. It is hard to believe after all of our tomfoolery during many years at university, that Jeremy is now one of the most respected, pre-eminent medical research doctors in Australasia — I can’t bring myself to say ‘the world’ because it’s Jeremy, after all. He has just returned from presenting ground-breaking research at Harvard University with Emeritus Professor E. Applegate.

    Jeremy always had a knack for pushing conventional boundaries and wisdom, continually searching for the unknown, the unexpected or unanticipated solutions to some of our most insurmountable medical problems. I even read in a newspaper article recently that he had been in meetings with none other than Melinda and Bill Gates in conjunction with his and Professor Applegate’s research in New York. It seems as if he is certainly mixing it with the global movers and shakers. I suppose, on reflection, he always had the determination and potential to achieve mastery in his chosen field. It is amazing what he has achieved in less than forty years of life. He is an exceptionally gifted human being, intellectually and emotionally, and people just adore his company. No doubt all these traits, along with his hard work, have enabled the success he is now hopefully enjoying.

    My career needs to fit in with my family life, well, the kids really; Jeremy’s career is his life, more or less. He has always been tenacious about his quest for sourcing medical cures and has been involved in discoveries that the western world almost takes for granted these days. With that sort of personal motivation and drive, it’s not surprising he hasn’t had time to settle down or find anyone special to share his life with. At least I’m not aware of anyone. He has always attracted interest from the opposite sex, like a George Clooney of the medical world; he certainly doesn’t suffer from lack of attention.

    Anyway, that’s what is making my stomach do flips, which is utterly ridiculous at my age. I allow myself a small smile as I find it mildly amusing I am still capable of that sort of fluttering teenage reaction. I am excited and a little nervous about seeing him after so long. The memories of our university days still flood my mind and haunt me whenever I’m alone and in a dark sensual mood, usually in the early hours of the morning …

    What is happening to me? I’m going to miss the plane if I don’t get moving!

    ‘Right, kids? Where are you? I need kisses and cuddles before I leave — I won’t see you for ten whole days!’ Big family hugs all round. I tell them I love them more than life itself and wish them a fabulous adventure in the wild west as they endeavour to track that elusive tiger; apparently legend has it there have been recent sightings. No doubt a camp of school kids is just what they need to be discovered again! However, the kids’ excitement and optimism filters through regardless.

    ‘And keep safe,’ I declare, promising that I can’t wait to hear every detail of their experience when I return.

    I hear the honk of a horn indicating my taxi’s arrival and do my last-minute check to ensure I have everything I need. I am thankful the butterflies have finally subsided. My lips barely touch my husband’s cheek as I tell him to take excellent care of my children and ensure he keeps them safe. A fleeting thought passes through my brain wondering when our relationship became so plastic, so platonic … I have too many things on my mind to delve further and quickly wish them all a wonderful adventure as he dutifully places my bag in the car and I wave goodbye, blowing kisses to the kids from my window as the taxi pulls out of the drive, airport bound.

                                               ***

    Focus, focus, focus! I keep saying to myself to little avail. My mind is in a state of complete distraction today, which is highly unusual. I hear the captain speaking, good weather, clear flight path, not expecting any delays. Flight attendants are telling me to put my seat belt on and tray up for take-off as they do every flight. It’s not like I don’t know that for goodness’ sake, I think, my irritation surprising me. But of course, I do what I’m told expeditiously as I don’t want to cause a scene. I reluctantly put my notes away and close my eyes momentarily as the plane slowly manoeuvres toward the runway. I feel my chest rising and falling lightly with each breath. Jeremy’s face flashes through my mind, his gorgeous cheeky smile and smoky green, seemingly bottomless eyes … his lips gently kissing my neck … his fingers lightly caressing my nipples … then teasing them to life …

    What am I doing? I force my mind to a screeching stop. This is absurd. I force myself back to the here and now and suddenly notice we are in the air and the seat belt sign is off. I breathe a sigh of relief. Now, back to my lecture. I talk myself into believing I am disciplined enough not to let my mind wander off for another second.

    I am good at being disciplined, I tell myself. I run an organised house, career and life overall. I love my family and my work and have studied long and hard to achieve what I have. Dr Alexandra Blake. I work between the business world and academia given my studies in both commerce and psychology. This combination has worked well for me financially and I am forever grateful that I am one of the lucky people in life who love their work and are passionate about what they do. Enough of self-talk and affirmations … I need to think about the presentation today.

    Once again, I ponder the topic of the lecture which I will be delivering to approximately 500 people in just a few hours’ time. This fact finally snaps my mind to attention. I consider using some additional questions and challenges to open discussion and promote their thinking. I like the idea so I note down the following points on my notepad to use for the end of the session.

        *    How important is visual perception to your mindset?

        *    How much do you depend on visual stimulation to               interpret your world?

        *    What senses do you believe would most compensate for a               lack of visual perception? Why? How?

Given research shows that body language — a visual sense — accounts for more than 90 per cent of communication between people, the significance of these sorts of questions becomes exponential.

    I’m feeling much calmer now that I am once again absorbed in my work. The rest of the flight goes smoothly and I arrive on time at the University of Sydney.

                                               ***

    ‘Dr Blake, good morning, great to have you back.’

    I look ahead and smile toward my PhD examiner, Samuel Webster. ‘Well, good morning to you too, Professor; it’s great to be back.’

    ‘You know you are always welcome, Alexandra. It’s been too long. It seems to be very difficult to draw you away from the south isle.’

    ‘Hmm, on reflection, it’s been a while. I guess time flies when you are having fun.’

    ‘I’m glad to hear it. You have certainly been busy on the research front. We’re looking forward to your lecture this afternoon.’

    ‘And as ever, I’m looking forward to hearing your insights and expertise. Thank you so much for your support in bringing this together.’

    ‘My pleasure, my dear, my pleasure. Do you have time for a quick lunch with some colleagues before you take centre stage?’

    ‘For you, Samuel, always.’ I smile again warmly as he leads me along the manicured lawns beside the beautiful, historic buildings. It feels good to be back.

    At lunch with Samuel, I reflect on what an honour it was to have him oversee my PhD. He specialises in defensive (passive and aggressive) behaviours in the workforce and was instrumental in developing my thesis. His global connections both in the corporate world and academia are second to none and his knowledge is immense. He’s recently been working hand in hand with the Brain and Mind Research Institute, which enables him to analyse many of his revolutionary hypotheses about behaviour and sexuality in the field of neuroscience. I find his work truly fascinating and being with him today allows me to see how passionate and absorbed he has become in this branch of his research.

    I find myself reflecting just how much of an impact Samuel has had on my career. The support and the sage advice when it all became too hard, made me feel obliged to hang in there for both him and the future rewards.He drives his PhD students hard and wants no stone left unturned. I smile internally at those years of insanity and frustration, pleased I completed them and relieved they are behind me.

    Samuel had offered me a senior lecturing position at Sydney University and was not happy when I turned it down for a similar role at the University of Tasmania. He taught me so much, I felt indebted to him, but he understood my reasons, that it was a lifestyle choice, particularly with a young family in tow. He promised he would stay in touch and support me both professionally and personally, and he has definitely been a man of his word. Samuel was instrumental in getting my research on visual perception off the ground and more recently became my chief academic sponsor, which is how I come to be presenting this lecture series today.

    I’m touched that he has taken the time to introduce me to his team of, in his words, ‘elite researchers’, who appear to be hanging on his every word. I suppose I looked the same way when I was a new postgrad. Brad, Max, Denise and Elijah, all of whom are doing fascinating work within the world of psychology and neuroscience. It makes me feel alive, interacting with kindred folk again. It certainly isn’t the type of discussion for the average dinner party. Very quickly the specifics of their research unfold and it would be remiss of me not to say I’m more than a little astounded by the path that follows. Given the calibre of people engaging in the impassioned discussion, the comments fly around the table almost too fast for me to assimilate.

    ‘Even the source of the female orgasm is still to be scientifically determined, unlike the male orgasm which has been extensively funded, researched scientifically and agreed medically.’

    ‘Basically, medical science continually refuses to acknowledge the physical reality of the female ejaculation and unfortunately it is not a priority. Lack of funding has impacted the ability to provide coherent education on the study of women’s sexual behaviours. We are hoping to change that.’

    ‘Even today, there is a notable disconnect between medicine and science in relation to the female orgasm, to the extent that the primary understanding of female ejaculation is still urinary stress incontinence.’

    ‘Did you realise that no one has been able to medically agree on the source of the orgasm, whether it be uterine, clitoral, vaginal, vulval or a blend of any of these combinations? Even though this concept of the female orgasm has been recorded in literature throughout history?’

    ‘The main problem being a distinct lack of participants able to generate orgasmic fluid in a clinical environment.’

    ‘Nobody can agree on the most effective way to generate the female orgasm which in effect makes sourcing it extremely difficult.’

    ‘The physical, emotional, hormonal and environmental states of the female all seem to play a significant role, but at this stage it is impossible to determine whether one plays a greater or lesser role than the other.

    The hypotheses are many and varied so we are now conducting more research on the neurological connections to help develop our theories further.’

    My mind at this point envisions rows of women wearing white robes all lined up in hospital beds with legs spread open attempting to generate an orgasm to be captured in a test tube.

    I quickly shake my head to dislodge the disturbing image penetrating my brain. I notice I have barely touched my lunch; I’m so caught up in the flow of the discussion.

    Samuel eventually concludes: ‘As you can see, my dear Alexandra, there is much more to understand and discover regarding the intricacies of the female orgasm, including the impact of intellectual and emotional components. The research is still highly subjective, personal and seemingly dependent on each woman’s individual experience of orgasm. We can only aspire to develop a more consistent approach regarding our research and conclusions.’

    I can’t help but be enthralled with the history and mystery that seemingly surrounds this subject. I had no idea the topic was still so contested medically and in some areas considered career and research ‘taboo’, for want of a better word. How it is possible that the female orgasm is so under-researched, when the male orgasm is considered scientifically and psychologically a fait accompli is frankly shocking to me, to say the least. I can’t quite believe what I’m hearing, and indeed wouldn’t have had it not come from the mouths of the people seated around the table. I manage to quickly swallow a few mouthfuls of food before Samuel and his crew wish me luck as we pack up and make our way toward the lecture theatre.

    ‘Would you care to join us for a Friday night drink, for old times’ sake? I’m sure the team would love to share some of the insights of their research so far.’ Samuel has a twinkle in his eye as I feel my cheeks flush a pale pink.

    ‘You know I’d love to, but unfortunately I have other plans for after the lecture.’

    ‘Of course you have, my dear, one can only ask.’

    For some reason, a nervous laugh escapes me, as if I’ve been caught off-guard.

    ‘I’m actually meeting an old friend from my undergrad days; you may remember him. Jeremy Quinn?’ I try very hard to keep my tone neutral — difficult when the mere mention of his name makes my heartbeat quicken.

    ‘Yes, indeed I do. Dr Quinn is taking the medical world by storm I hear, causing all sorts of waves and excitement in the US in connection to his research on depression. He’s working with Professor Applegate, is he not?’

    I should have known Samuel would be more up to speed than I was in relation to what’s hot in global academia.

    ‘I believe so, albeit from an article, not from him personally.’

    ‘Send him my best regards. A very talented man, that Dr Quinn. No doubt there will be many a pharmaceutical company keen for his research. He certainly won’t have any of the funding concerns that constrain us, lucky chap.’

    I’m not sure I fully comprehend this connection as my mind automatically shifts into gear for the lecture just moments away.

    ‘Will do and thanks for everything, Samuel. It’s been wonderful catching up with you again. I wish you and your team the very best. Let me know if I can be of any assistance.’

    Suddenly, given the discussion at lunch, I wasn’t one hundred per cent sure whether that was an appropriate comment or not!

    ‘Indeed my dear. Go forth and conquer.’ We hug farewell and I head to the lectern for my imminent presentation

                                               ***

What a beautiful Friday afternoon in Sydney, everyone basking in glorious sunshine.

    This city can really turn it on when it needs to. The harbour is sparkling with yachts and ferries merrily bouncing along, the colours are sharp and bold and the city is bustling. Office workers are gearing up for the weekend with such a vibrant beginning, as they head off to drinks along the harbour foreshore. I see some ‘beautiful people’ bouncing along for cocktails, laughing and smiling with a buoyant swing in their step. They look like they have just stepped out of Vogue magazine. I remember when I was one of those girls, focusing on career but as carefree as the wind, with the luxury of time and whispers of what the future might hold caressing every interaction. The main priority occupying our minds then was wondering how the weekend would unfold from twilight onwards and which cocktail to choose first.

    It was on one of those nights that my relationship with Jeremy transformed from best friends constantly mucking around with each other to a high-octane sexual one. As the taxi drives past the key visual triggers where it all started in the city, I can’t help but remember the carnal lust and intensity we shared; the impact of such memories makes me squirm in my seat.

    Back then, I had just started vacation work with one of the big four banks in the city. The job wasn’t that exciting but the people were fun and it provided me with some much-needed cash during the summer holidays. It was great to be free from study for a few months and I was secretly thrilled to be wearing a suit and high heels, and mum had bought me a sensational new handbag, which I still have today …

    ‘Hi, Jeremy, I’m just going out to my first official corporate work     function—’

        ‘Yeah, I’m excited. I’ll be at the Wentworth and will be meeting     the girls at nine-ish for a drink and a boogie.’

        ‘Sure, grab them and come along. We’ll meet you there.'

        'No worries. Cool. See you later then.’

        I hang up the phone.

        He seems really keen to catch up with us all. Hmm, think     secretly, I wonder if he likes Eloise, most guys do … maybe I should     mention something … The girls think she is going through a phase     of exploring the other side, i.e. chicks, but we haven’t been able to     confirm or deny the rumour … I’m sure she’ll tell us either way     when she is ready. No, I confirm to myself, keep out of it, what will     be, will be …

        These corporate functions are cool because you get free food     and drinks. We stay for a while, then decide it is time for our real     Friday night to begin. We pack up and head to the club, where it’s     straight to the ladies room to discard jackets, our pantyhose, undo     a few buttons, plump up our cleavage, puff our hair, reapply     mascara, eyeliner and lipstick. We reappear audacious and     revamped, ready to embrace the evening.

        The music is pumping and given we have already had a few     sparkling wines, we hit the dance floor — as only a group of girls     can do. I’m lost in the music, dancing with my eyes closed, when     strong hands grasp my hips and pull me backward toward their     body. Instinctively, I know Jeremy has arrived and happily gyrate     into his swivelling hips in time to the music. For some reason, we     are in complete sync on the dance floor, our bodies are moving as     one. It’s hard not to get lost in the feel of his body against mine,     the pounding music creating a heady atmosphere around us. This is     hot with a capital H! I almost feel as if I am magnetically drawn     to him; some strange pent-up energy between us makes me     unwilling to let him go … Something has shifted between us as I     look into his darkened eyes, utterly mesmerised by the intensity of     his being. What is wrong with me tonight? My hormones seem to     be locked in lust overdrive.

        The music is too loud to hear his words, so he grabs my hand     and leads me in a determined path off the dance floor to one of the     shadowed corners of the club where the music is slightly muffled.     He pushes me gently back against the wall and places his hands     either side of my shoulders, his presence pinioning me against     the wall.In his fitted black shirt, his body looks toned and hot and     his face is glistening, close to mine, due to our heroics on the dance     floor. It takes me a moment to catch my breath as I allow myself to     become lost in his seductive presence.It is as if my eyes have been     opened for the first time as his sexual magnetism overwhelms and     draws me in. I open my mouth slightly to ensure enough oxygen     is getting to my brain.

        ‘I don’t think I can keep my hands off you any more, AB.’

        He honestly looks like he is pushing his hands harder into the     wall to keep them away from me.

        ‘Then don’t.’ Emboldened by this swelling of lust and desire, I’m     sure I must be producing alluring sexual pheromones.

        I pull his right palm off the wall, bring it to my lips, give his     middle finger a gentle kiss and slowly slide it over my breast. His     eyes widen as I continue its journey lower until it finds the secret     passage under my skirt. I part my legs slightly, never breaking     eye contact, and slide his finger past my knickers and lead him     directly to my sweet spot.

        ‘Jesus, Alex, you are so wet.’

        ‘Hmm. I am. Do you have a solution for my problem?’

        The shock on Jeremy’s face is truly priceless and I have to admit,     I never expected those words to leave my mouth, but they’re out     now. We are both a little stunned as we continue to silently     question each other to ascertain a true sense of this new reality.

        Seemingly compelled to action, Jeremy immediately removes his     hand leaving a draft in his wake, grabs my wrist and strides so     fast back toward our friends, I am almost stumbling along     behind him. I hope I haven’t offended him … maybe I shouldn’t     have said that …

        He stops suddenly and I slam into his body. Jeez!

        He grabs my handbag, marches straight to the dance floor and     shouts something in my friend’s ear, so she waves and smiles at     me. I raise my eyebrows at her and shrug my shoulders as I give     her a wave before I am just as suddenly whisked away and out the     front door of the club.

        ‘What are we doing?’

        No response. Jeremy is in action mode.

        He readjusts his hand from my wrist to clasping his fingers     through mine as we charge down the street. My ears are still     ringing from the noise of the club.

        ‘Are you not talking to me?’ Maybe he is as mad as hell. Oh     dear, what was I thinking? Maybe I’ve ruined our whole friendship.

        We are striding uphill and I’m panting to keep up with him. We     seem to be heading toward the botanical gardens. When we reach     grass, he swoops down, lifts me over his shoulder and walks     silently under the moonlight before depositing me in a standing     position under a particularly large tree. He drops my handbag to     the ground, immediately cupping my face with his hands and     devouring my mouth with such ferocity I’m forced up against the     tree. His body anchors me in position and I’m wild with lust for     him. He pulls a condom out of his pocket, unbuttons his jeans in     record time, slides it on … this is the first time I have seen Jeremy’s     penis and even though it is dark, what a sight. His eyes have     returned from their carnal state when he registers my look with a     mischievous grin.

        ‘Ready?’

        I nod in greedy agreement.

        He hitches my skirt up to my waist, lowers my knickers to my     feet, bending my knees to free them from underneath my shoes     and stuffs them in his pocket … Interesting, I can’t help but think,     kinky but interesting!

        He hoists my legs up to wrap around his waist and I curl my     arms tight around his neck with my back against the enormous     trunk of the tree. It’s rough and bark pokes into my satin blouse. I     briefly hope that it doesn’t rip the fabric but realise at this point,     I don’t care either way. He pauses before I nod again, confirming     that I am more than ready for this, beyond ready, as if we have     been teasing and tantalising and playing with each other     platonically for far too long. The sexual electricity between us     needs to explode in order for it to begin — confirming that we both     need this and we need it NOW.

        He slams into me.

        And it is glorious!

        And he does it again ...

        And it is more glorious …

        And again!

        And again!

        He impales me.

        And I am loving it.

        I stare up at the moon and release my howl in honour of its     magnificence, of our magnificence. He explodes inside me as our     carnal desire for each other is finally given physical recognition.

        Could anyone see us? Did anyone see us? Do I care …

        We lay on the grass for hours with each other, wondering at     each other, talking and playing and laughing and teasing. Until the     night lightens and dawn breaks. It’s as if we have been in a void of     time. We stumble into a taxi together; I fall asleep on his shoulder     and find myself tucked in my bed a few hours later. My first time     with Jeremy is confirmed to be a reality and not a dream by the     twigs in my hair and grass stains on my shirt. My knickers     apparently never made it home …

I let out a sigh. Wow! I’m sure I am flushing and I know I’m wriggling around in my seat. I’m glad the driver hasn’t noticed. I smile to myself at the distant, delicious memory. I haven’t felt like this for years, well, probably since the last time I saw Jeremy alone. The fun days and carefree nights, no responsibilities — although we thought we had them at the time — no kids, no house, no mortgage … Would I honestly want life to be any different from what it is now? Not really, a bit more fun and carefree every now and then wouldn’t go astray, but I am reasonably happy with my life as it is now. Not my sex life admittedly, which has been less than average since Jordan was born, or pretty well non-existent if I’m perfectly honest. That thought is a shock. How have I missed this? Have I been too busy in life to notice this key element has gone missing? Isn’t it even more concerning that I haven’t considered it an issue? No wonder I’m sitting in the back of a taxi in a state of latent, lustful desire. A vision enters my mind of sleeping beauty awaiting her sexual awakening after decades of sleep, which is quite sweet until I realise her face is mine and the prince is Jeremy. But the kids, remember the kids … Would it be worth the risk? I resolutely block my mind from receiving any more of these unproductive thoughts.

    It feels good having the first lecture successfully behind me. The feedback and questions have given me more food for thought in respect to further investigative and academic research. I think ahead to my weekend. Catching up with my old school friends over a glass of wine, their careers, their social lives and family news. Who’s still with whom, who has moved on, and I’m sure there are a few more babies I have missed since being based in Tasmania. Then catching up with my siblings and nieces and nephews for a BBQ on Sunday. It’s a shame Jordan and Elizabeth won’t be there, as they love catching up with their cousins, but next time perhaps.

    With my trip down memory lane and thoughts about the weekend ahead, I’m a little surprised how quickly we have arrived at the destination. I quickly check my lipstick and hair and decide I will definitely need to refresh in the hotel lobby. As I pay the taxi driver, the butterflies previously asleep in my stomach announce their tumultuous arrival and my palms moisten as I gather my bags together.

    That memory has certainly destabilised me more than I would have liked. Stay calm and composed, you are a professional, married woman, a mother of two … Enough with the self-talk!

    I head straight through the lobby of the five-star hotel to the ladies room in an attempt to stabilise my stomach. What is going on with me today? I shake my head and try to pull myself together. The tingle down below is certainly not helping to calm my nerves nor my ability to control my physiology. Quite frustrating to say the least. How is it that I felt perfectly comfortable lecturing to hundreds of people just hours ago, yet now my fingers are trembling so badly that I can barely unwind my lipstick?

    I gaze into the mirror while both hands grip the basin. I notice the slight wrinkles around my eyes. Were they there last time I saw Jeremy? Maybe I should have taken my friend’s advice and given Botox a try, in her words ‘before it’s too late!’ I shudder at the thought of it. I can’t stand anything around my eyes let alone the idea of an injection piercing through such sensitive skin. Oh well, I think to myself, I’ll just have to put up with what I see in the mirror until they come up with something a little less invasive.

    Distracted and flustered, I can’t decide whether to leave my hair up or take it out. I’m grateful my hair is still dark and as yet I haven’t managed to find a random grey strand, although I’m sure that day isn’t far off. I figure I will stay with the more professional look and leave it up; I am in a suit after all. Right, all ready to go, or at least as ready as I will ever be. Not too bad for thirty-six. I take a final glance in the mirror, and think it could certainly be worse, as I desperately search for a positive spin. Deep down, I am very much looking forward to catching up with Jeremy. So I let myself run with that emotion as my mind takes me on another quick trip down memory lane …

    Jeremy and I were at university together, although he was two years ahead of me. My cousin introduced us during my first year, as they were both in the same water polo team. I’m not absolutely sure how our acquaintance evolved but he was a lot of fun and as we spent more and more time together we eventually became best friends, almost by default. As time went by we explored drinking, drugs and sex — as many uni students do. Partners came and went throughout our years of study but we were always there for each other, first and foremost. It was difficult for people to describe, let alone determine, our relationship with each other, more than likely because it was also impossible for us. After a while, our friends didn’t bother to try and label us and just accepted that Jeremy and I would be friends forever, whatever came our way. Funnily enough, over time, we eventually accepted it too …

    Life took us in different directions post-university. Jeremy continued his studies before getting his pilot’s licence and joining the flying doctor service for a truly Australian outback experience, which he loved and I was always a little jealous of (the pilot’s licence anyway). I worked in London focusing on building strong financial foundations before further exploring psychology in the workplace.

    We caught up in various locations around the globe over the next decade, particularly in Europe where his medical research brought him regularly to London. We had many short funfilled flings that are treasured memories, before we embarked on the serious responsibilities of life. Although we knew our relationship was significant in our lives, we understood that it would never be long-term, or at least I knew that Jeremy was far from ready to settle down, unlike me. It was the ‘unspoken word’ between us, although, deep down, we knew it to be a fully acknowledged reality.

    His career was of paramount importance to him and I desperately wanted to start a family and our differing worlds drifted apart. Jeremy was offered a lucrative research scholarship at Harvard to further his studies and moved to America. I met my English husband, Robert, in London and we returned together to Australia. I knew I needed to put my explicit sexual past with Jeremy behind me and settle down to start a family and pursue my career academically. Which is exactly what I did.

    Although we caught up for the odd dinner here and there, for the next decade or so, we were essentially on opposite sides of the planet. And our lives continued separately …

    I pull my mind back to the here and now and tell myself firmly that camping out in the ladies is just wasting the precious time we will have together — so get moving! I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, straighten my shoulders, hold my head high, swing open the door and walk confidently out toward the man who is my best friend and my ex-lover.

    As my eyes sweep the lobby bar, my confidence evaporates as quickly as it had been conjured up — he is not here. Disappointment washes over me with such ferocity, I have to lower my hand to the lounge to maintain my standing position. Typical, I think to myself; I started the day with butterflies and ridiculous thoughts, like a teenager anticipating seeing their ultimate pop idol for the first time, and ended it talking to myself in the ladies room of a flash hotel.

    I do know how hectic Jeremy’s life is and that his schedule is ever-changing. Of course it would be highly unlikely for him to catch up with me just because we both happen to be coincidentally in Sydney this weekend. I am disappointed that I have wasted so much nervous energy for nothing, yet a part of me feels pleased that I am still able to feel those sensations when I had thought they were long gone. It serves me right really; I should have stayed and had drinks with Samuel and his colleagues. But I eagerly declined knowing I would be meeting with Jeremy and didn’t want to be late.

    Jeremy’s assistant had said he would be caught up in meetings most of the afternoon. Just as I think to check my phone for messages, a man in uniform with a concierge badge on approaches me.

    ‘Excuse me. Doctor Alexandra Blake?’

    ‘Oh. Yes.’

    ‘A gentleman asked me to pass this message on to you and convey his sincere apologies that he is unable to meet you here.’

    My heart sinks as my fears are now confirmed; he can’t make it. Disappointment washes over me all over again.

    He hands me an envelope. ‘Thank you very much, Doctor Blake. If there is anything I can help you with, please don’t hesitate to ask.’

    I smile as much to myself as to the concierge. Jeremy always insisted on calling me ‘Doctor’ once I graduated with my PhD, even though he is the true medical doctor and I am the philosophical kind. He knows I’m not good at medical emergencies and have an inherent fear of hospitals, so it was always a joke between us.

    I take a seat on the velvet lounge and open the envelope to pull out the typed note inside:

    To my dearest friend, Doctor A. Blake,

        My sincere apologies for leaving you stranded in the hotel lobby     this Friday evening. I had a few unavoidable errands come up at     the last minute, which have caused some delays. Everything seems     to be in order now and I would very much appreciate you joining     me upstairs for a drink. It has been too long!

        Please find the security key for the penthouse floor in the     envelope.

        I eagerly anticipate your arrival.

        Love,

        J. xo

My stomach flips and turns like a gymnast competing for the Olympic gold medal. Once again I am instantly transformed into a teenage groupie — he is here after all! But what is he doing in the penthouse? The Jeremy I knew always shunned the flashier side of life, preferring to maintain a more austere public persona. Although, if I remember rightly, when surrounded by those who knew him well, he could certainly relax into a mischievous rebel at times, enjoying the finer things life had to offer. Perhaps Samuel’s comments weren’t misguided when mentioning the bottomless funding of pharmaceutical companies. I can only wonder if the Jeremy of old still exists in the Jeremy of now.

                                               ***

    As I gather myself together both mentally and physically, I notice the concierge still hovering in the background — does he have nothing better to do? The thought randomly floats through my brain.

    ‘Is everything in order, Doctor Blake, can I help in any way?’

    I wonder what expression I have on my face as I turn to look at him. I notice the faintest of smiles at the corner of his mouth, his eyes twinkling. Dumbfounded, I shake my head. ‘No, thank you, I’m fine.’

    Was I? I am beginning to wonder. He continues to loiter behind me. I change my mind and turn to him.

    ‘Actually, yes. Could you please show me the way to the lift for the penthouse?’

    ‘Of course, Doctor Blake, it would be my pleasure. Right this way and may I take your bags?’

    He says it in a way that makes me think he is in on something I don’t quite comprehend, and a strange feeling passes through me. Perhaps I’m just not up to speed on the service at five-star hotels these days. Knowing I’m not feeling exactly normal at this point, I push the thought out of my head and conclude that my mind could easily be playing tricks on me.

    ‘Thank you, that would be lovely,’ I say politely, and follow him as he leads the way to the lift with my bags in tow.

    Seconds later the lift is racing rapidly toward the lofty heights of the penthouse floor. I take a few deep breaths in an attempt to calm my nerves. What a wonderful idea to have a drink while overlooking the city as twilight descends, always a spectacular view with weather like today. I’m not sure if Jeremy is staying in the hotel, but if he has access to the business lounge we may be able to have complimentary nibbles and drinks. Strange how the concept of free drinks still resonates with me, must be left over from uni days … I let out a little chuckle. The concierge must think I’m crazy.

    As the doors open, I realise I am genuinely excited about seeing Jeremy; he is an amazing man and a truly great friend. The disappointment of believing he couldn’t meet me had hit me harder than I ever imagined possible. Now I feel happy, excited and very much looking forward to a wonderful heartfelt reunion as only best friends can.

    I am assaulted by the magnificent views in front me as I step out of the lift and into a carpeted room with floor-to-ceiling windows — I had forgotten how truly captivating Sydney Harbour is from these spectacular heights. I take a moment to absorb the visual feast before my eyes. Sparkling blue water with tiny white flecks. Ferries and yachts curve arching ripples across the silky water, and the buildings imbued with a rosy glow, reflecting the light of the sinking sun. Looking around to orientate myself, it seems strange I can’t see any bar on this level.

    ‘This way please, Doctor.’ I almost forget the concierge is standing beside me with my bag. I check the security card and notice the symbol on it matches the one the wall. I follow the arrows with my eyes as we walk in silence. ;Finally I find myself standing tentatively in front of large double doors. Before either of us have a moment to press the buzzer, the door flies open in front of us. And standing before me is Jeremy. More sophisticatedly handsome than I had dared allow myself to remember.

    ‘Hey AB, there you are. Welcome.’

    ‘Hi,’ I respond, fairly quietly, almost shyly. ‘It’s been a while.’

    ‘I see Roger found you in the lobby. Thanks for taking care of her for me. I’ll take it from here, cheers.’ He takes my bag from the concierge and ushers me in, closing the door behind me.

    ‘You’re right; it has been too long, way too long in my opinion.’ He excitedly wraps his arms around me, almost lifting me off the floor in an all-embracing hug, his eyes twinkling all the while.

    ‘Let me look at you.’ He holds me at arm’s length and his eyes absorb my face, my hair, my body, my legs, right down to my toes. I had forgotten how penetrating his stare could be and it catches me unawares, leaving me suddenly feeling utterly self-conscious. I quickly look away to avoid seeing any further analysis.

    ‘You look wonderful, Alex, still my young green-eyed Catherine Zeta-Jones,’ he says intently, this time embracing me softly, lightly kissing my forehead, as if giving me his stamp of approval.

    ‘And you aren’t looking too bad yourself given you’re almost forty, Dr Quinn,’ I say cheekily, needing to immediately lighten the mood, both because of his possessive words and the intense emotions rushing through my body.

    I don’t trust myself to fully absorb his appearance but at first glance it doesn’t look like much has changed over the years, except a little salt gently peppering his dark hair. Still confident, toned, mischievous … he does look good. If I’m really honest he looks great, actually; broad, square shoulders, six foot two inches tall, clean shaven. He smells beautiful. It has been many years since I have been this intimate with his spicy, outdoorsy scent but the cloud of arousal it stirs up penetrates deep within my core; his tight round arse looks sensational in his causal trousers. Dear god, I am in sensory overload and I have just arrived … Stop it! Look somewhere else, I scream internally as I command my eyes to slide off his body to the broader environment.

    ‘Wow, this place is amazing. Are you staying here?’

    ‘Yes, indeed I am. I’m here for the week.’

    ‘Well, you have certainly moved up in the world, my friend.’ He shrugs his shoulders and grins sheepishly. I love that smile. I love those lips. I love those lips on my breasts. God! Stop this, now.

    ‘Come on in. Relax, please make yourself at home.’ Jeremy leads me to the lounge room, obviously sensing I’m far from relaxed. Working myself into a right state would be more accurate.

    ‘I thought we were meeting at a penthouse bar for a drink. I wasn’t expecting to be in your suite.’ I try to keep my voice conversational, tempering my rising level of anxiety.

    ‘Does that cause you any concern?’ he asks directly.

    ‘Ah, oh, no.’ I stumble the words out. ‘No, not at all.’ Should it? I think to myself.

    ‘Good.’

    I hear the pop of a cork, which startles me a little, and Jeremy pours me a glass of champagne. It is perfectly chilled and the bubbles within the crystal glass provide me with a visual representation of how my stomach has been feeling most of the day.

    ‘Cheers, Doctor Blake. I’ve missed you, my friend, my confidante.’

    My heart skips a beat as he utters these words, my mind comprehending the emotional depth attached to them.

    ‘Cheers to you too, Dr Quinn.’ We clink our glasses together as our eyes capture one another’s gaze for the first time in a very long time.

    ‘How are you, Jeremy? How is your life going? Have you met anyone? Are you enjoying the US? And what about work, you sound so busy with everything …’ God, I can’t stop myself blathering! He laughs as he raises his hand to interrupt my inquisition.

    ‘You’ve never been short of a question, Alexa, have you?’ He raises one eyebrow and pauses. ‘I suppose some things never change.’ His comment is teasing and laced with innuendo.

    His look is direct, though somewhat mischievous at the same time. I shuffle uncomfortably at the intensity of his stare and the weight I assume is behind his words. I wish I could read his facial expressions more clearly but as we haven’t seen each other for so long, they are unfortunately too masked for me to decipher at this point.

    ‘It’s just that there is always so much to catch up on in the time we have. I don’t want to miss anything, don’t want to waste our conversation,’ I reply in my defence.

    ‘We won’t, I promise you. Now drink up.’

    I notice I still haven’t touched my champagne. We both sip a mouthful of the golden bubbles at the same time. It tastes so delicious, initially dry with a sweet aftertaste and I feel the bubbles pop on my tongue. I can’t help but take another.

    ‘Now, before I attempt to answer your myriad questions, tell me, what are your plans for this weekend? Who has the pleasure of your company?’

    Happy to ease back into conversation, I comfortably rattle off the details of my weekend, particularly as he knows most of the people I am seeing. I tell him about Robert and the kids being away on their great adventure and about my catching up with Samuel at the university, my family and my old school friends.

    He listens attentively, without interrupting, and I barely notice as he refills my glass. I can’t say whether it is nerves or excitement that keeps my chatter going and the champagne flowing.

    ‘Enough about me.’ I realise Jeremy hasn’t spoken in some time and we have plenty to discuss other than my plans for the weekend. I stop to look at him more carefully and notice his tense expression. ‘You’re very quiet, Jeremy. Is there something wrong?’

    He stands up and walks deliberately toward where I’m seated on the lounge. Silently, he squats on the floor ensuring he is looking directly into my eyes and places his hand on my stockinged knee. A mild electric current travels straight up my leg and I jerk at the sensation. The hint of a smile emerges on his face at my reaction, as if pleased he still has this impact, before it quickly disappears and he regains focus and control of the moment. I immediately blush, blending perfectly with the rose cushion at my back. There is no way he can’t notice that I am practically beside myself at his touch. Completely embarrassed, I shift my body weight uneasily on the lounge, while his position is statuesque. My rising anxiety immediately prevents me from uttering a sound.

    ‘Alexandra, I want to ask you something and I’m honestly not sure what you will say or how you’ll react.’

    It must be serious if he is using my full name.

    He pauses, staring unrelentingly into my eyes.

    ‘Which is unusual for me …’ he muses.

    He fixes both hands firmly on my knees, as if anchoring my feet to the ground lest I should fly away like a helium balloon. ‘So, I’ll just come straight out with it.’

    I don’t move an inch.

    I do nothing except hold his gaze.

    I concentrate on moderating my breathing.

    I wait for him to continue.

    ‘I would like you to stay the weekend here with me and cancel your other plans.’ He pauses, looking at me from beneath his long, thick eyelashes. My heart literally skips a beat.

    Or two. Or maybe three.

    As his gaze intensifies, I become lost in his eyes.

    Our shared, ancient memories come flooding back into my brain: flashes of university days, ridiculous pranks, lust and love and orgasms and sex, friendship, tears of laughter, tears of pain, experimentation, stolen moments. It was fun, it was edgy, exhilarating and exciting, and there seemed to be no other way with Jeremy.

    The look in his eyes conveys all of that and more to me in a few long seconds. I never knew quite what was going to happen next with Jeremy and here I am, all these years later in the same situation.

    Albeit with very different life circumstances. Our silent dialogue continues dancing between us. Once again daring us to take a risk that would never be taken with anyone else, only each other.

    My mind begins to race as fast as my heart.

    What if I did stay? Would it be the worst thing I could do? People always talk about living life to the fullest, expecting the unexpected … Wouldn’t a weekend with Jeremy make me feel more alive than I have in years? Given the effect of his touch on my knee, I can only imagine how I would respond to, well, his touch on other parts of my body …

    Finally, my motherly instinct anchors these abstract and fleeting thoughts so commonsense can prevail. My children. My life isn’t just about me any more; there are consequences for my actions. The guilt … the betrayal … Robert …. My stomach is in knots. How can I feel such anticipation and remorse simultaneously? It doesn’t make sense to me. My clinical mind quickly shifts a gear and makes a mental note to explore the psychology around such intense emotions and the resulting change in my physiology. My immediate situation renders my clinical experience redundant. God, what am I doing, thinking, feeling? Jeremy still has his hands on my knees as his eyes bore into my soul. Moments pass until, as if reading my thoughts, he releases his hold on my eyes and withdraws his touch, rising to step toward the panoramic view.

    I immediately inhale as if I have been released from a spell. I must have been holding my breath for quite some time. As he continues to stare out toward the harbour, he says, in a bemused voice: ‘Let me guess. You are currently analysing every angle of this situation.’ He turns to look into my eyes once again before returning his gaze outward and nods, as if to confirm for himself that he is on the right track before continuing.

    ‘You are weighing up the pros and cons of accepting my offer. One side of you is excited, enticed almost, about the possibilities of the experience, the other is fully grounded in the responsibilities of your existing life, giving rise to endless questions and what-if scenarios and which mean you need more time for consideration and reflection. Truly, Alex, it would take many lifetimes’ worth of experience to answer your questions and even then, never reach a satisfactory conclusion. Am I right?’ Once again, looking toward me for confirmation.

    All I can do is nod my head in agreement. He is reading me like a book. Actually, if I’m truly honest about it, he is reading me better than I can read myself, which disturbs me no end. The accuracy of his words catches me off-guard, his summary both measured and precise. Am I that easy to read or does he really know me that well? I thought he would have forgotten over the years … but if I haven’t, how could I naively assume he had? That is a truly scary consideration given my current predicament. He continues with his barrage of my presumed concerns.

    ‘What about your family? Do you really want this? What will it mean if you stay? What would your friends think? How would you justify your decision? Could you live with yourself? And dare I say it, what would happen if you truly let yourself go, even if it were just for one weekend?’

    I sit before him, embarrassed at the truth behind his take on my questions, by the depth of his knowledge of my thought processes. But I also know he isn’t playing fair now and is deliberately pushing my personal boundaries.

    His last question was the summation of many of our conversations throughout our relationship. He knows I put others before myself and always castigated me about it, particularly if I chose paths he could see ending badly for me. He always made me ponder the question of ‘what if’? What if, just once, I didn’t try to control or orchestrate myself and others, didn’t play it safe? What if it was a good thing to not know what was going to happen next or how someone was going to feel about it? Could it still be worth the risk?

    My immediate concerns were, unfortunately, way too easy to summarise given the moral dilemma I faced. The real issue for me is, in reality, quite simple — can I say no to Jeremy?

    He is playing me well. I know it and he certainly knows it. Even though I try to erase any distinctive emotion, he can read my face intuitively, see through any mask I put on. His understated smirk causes me greater anxiety than the myriad other feelings I am filtering through my head.

    My voice arrives quietly but firmly.

    ‘That’s really not fair, Jeremy. Do we have to have this conversation right now? Can’t we just catch up and see how things go?’ My voice trails off at these words. He knows I’m trying to hedge my bets and he can easily see through my attempted poker face, never a good position to be in with him. I unconsciously brace myself for our battle of minds, knowing that my brain is in a boxing ring with the right side fighting with the left, both deftly defending their position without understanding they are both on the same team — not helpful.

    He walks slowly and deliberately away from the glass panels over to the champagne bucket, carefully picks up the bottle and walks back toward me. He silently notices my hands trembling as he slides his hand down along my fingers and removes the glass I’m holding, refills it and places it carefully on the side table next to the lounge. He kneels in front of me, holding both my hands in his and lets out a sigh. The power and presence emanating from him is in stark contrast to his apparently submissive position on the floor. I can barely breathe the air between us it is so thick with tension. I feel like a deer caught in headlights.

    ‘Now Alex, listen to me, and please listen carefully.’ His voice is slow, firm, commanding. ‘You and I go a long way back and I want to spend the next forty-eight hours with you. I don’t want to have a few drinks and have you disappear into the universe again.

    ‘I know it has been tense between us since you arrived and that’s because we’re constrained by time. If we know we have two full days together, we will be able to really get to know each other again. Let it be just about us, no one else — just this once. It’s important to me, Alex, I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t. I don’t want to argue with you, I don’t want to scare you, I just need to know now that we will have this time together, time we haven’t had for many years.’

    My ears are ringing in confusion, as is my heart. The electric current running from his hand into mine lands straight between my legs, so much so, that I almost believe he can feel it.

    He wraps his fingers around my wrists, his eyes pleading with mine. ‘Please. Alex, I’m begging you … forty-eight hours? Tell me you’ll stay.’

    My mind has gone AWOL. I can barely breathe, let alone speak. What is he doing to me? I have never heard him sound like this, so needy, so longing. I think to myself that maybe he is in some type of trouble or pain and needs to talk about it. My heart says, Yes that’s it, he is my best friend and he needs me. Of course, I should have picked up on it before. Why else would he sound so beseeching? He probably doesn’t have too many close friends he can talk to like he can with me, particularly given the pressure and responsibility of his job and research commitments. He obviously needs to talk otherwise he wouldn’t be putting me in this situation. And here I am, contemplating not being there for my friend, my best friend, just when he needs me.

    Needless to say, I lose the battle as my voice concurs with my heart’s logic. And I hear myself say ever so softly, ‘I suppose … I could …’ I can barely get the words out of my constricted throat as they form an almost inaudible whisper.

    But because Jeremy is still so close, he hears them. With eagerness written all over his face he asks, ‘Did you say what I think you said?’

    Is he really trying to make me say it again? It was hard enough the first time.

    ‘I need to know you’re committed. You have no idea how important this is to me.’

    I take a deep breath.

    ‘Yes, I will stay for the weekend,’ I confirm, a little more clearly.

    A smile instantly washes over his face as he releases my wrists, sweeps me off the lounge and embraces me tightly as he spins me around the room. I can’t help but laugh as the tension vanishes between us.

    ‘Thank you, Alexandra. You won’t regret it, I promise.’

    He excitedly reaches for the waiting glasses of champagne. ‘Let’s toast. To the next forty-eight hours.’

    To which I can’t help but think, Oh dear, but toast him nonetheless and allow the bubbles of the champagne to join their butterfly friends in my stomach.

    Before I can come to terms with the reality of my agreement, he says, quick as a flash, ‘Right. AB, where’s your phone?’

    Of course, I will need to let others know of my sudden change of plans, the forthcoming consequences to my family and friends finally dawning on me.

    ‘What am I going to say? What will they think?’ I am talking out loud as I fumble around in my congested handbag and locate my phone. Reservations once again creep into my thoughts.Am I doing the right thing? Was it a moment of weakness or desire that made me say yes? Undoubtedly both!

    ‘Jeremy, maybe I shouldn’t … it’s not right …’

    ‘No buts, no regrets, AB!’

    Jeremy bounces right next to me on the lounge, as if sensing my apprehension and second thoughts. He snatches the phone out of my hand and strides to the other side of the room. The excitable puppy is turning panther-like with frightening ease and grace.

    ‘Let me take care of that for you,’ he says with a huge grin on his face.

    He has completely regressed. Where is the distinguished, globally acknowledged and multi-award-winning medical research doctor? I am apparently back at uni with my cocky mate, still teasing and tormenting me.

    ‘Please give it back.’

    ‘Not on your life, sweetheart, you’re mine for the weekend. You just said so yourself. Don’t worry, I will send through a message on your behalf.’

    I have no idea whether he is serious or not.

    ‘I am more than capable of sending a message from my own phone.’ I walk over to where he is standing, my hand outstretched, waiting. ‘Give it to me, now.’ My voice is stern as he ducks and weaves, manoeuvring himself away from me like a complete idiot.

    ‘I need to call home. JEREMY!’ I scream at him as he continues his childish movements around the room.

    ‘No, you don’t need to call home. You just told me they are in the wilderness, with no phone reception for the next week. There is absolutely no reason you need to call them or worry about it.’

    So that explains the intense interest with which he was listening to my plans. I should have known he had an ulterior motive.

    ‘Jeremy, stop mucking around.’ Panic starts to permeate my voice as he runs into the bedroom closing the door behind him.

    ‘This is not funny. Give me my damn phone, you bastard.’ I furiously pound on the door he is obviously leaning against to keep me out.

    ‘Ah, there’s the feisty Alex I know. There’s the spark I’ve been hoping for … Now, whom do we need to inform of your intriguing change of plans? Your brother. And Trish, she can then send to the others … oh, and Sally. That should just about do it, shouldn’t it?’

    ‘Jeremy, don’t you dare!’ I am seething.

    He comes out from behind the door, ensuring I am well away from him as he reads out the message. Before I can respond, he presses Send.

    ‘You didn’t?’ I gasp.

    ‘There, you are officially mine for the next forty-eight hours.’ He looks like the cat that swallowed the canary.

    He then turns off my phone, walks over to the cupboard, opens the door, presses a code to open the safe while blocking my view, places the phone inside and promptly locks the door.

    He spins around to see the look of absolute shock on my face.

    ‘What the hell do you think you are doing?’ I explode. ‘I need to have that phone with me. Anything could happen.’

    I feel as if he has temporarily disconnected me from my life. I realise that is exactly what he is hoping to achieve. I find it a very strange, weird sensation, being completely uncontactable.

    ‘Explain to me, AB. Are you saying that the world won’t survive with your phone switched off for a couple of days, or you won’t?’

    The tone of his voice and the look in his eyes clearly tells me that any arguments regarding this matter will be futile.

    ‘Why are you doing this?’

    ‘Simple. I’m being selfish. I know that you are always available to your family and friends and I have no intentions of sharing you with anyone else this weekend. That means no interruptions.’

    I stare at him dumbfounded. ‘When did you become so bossy and controlling?’

    ‘I had a good teacher at university, and I’ve been practising for the past few years,’ he says, winking at me.

    As I move toward the cupboard, his octopus arms grab me around the waist and hoist me into the air before firmly depositing me on the lounge.

    ‘I don’t think so.’ He is grinning now.

    ‘We are not at uni now, Jeremy. I’m a grown woman, for god’s sake!’ I sound like a school teacher. He stands over me, eagerly anticipating my next move.

    ‘Fine,’ I say, folding my arms across my chest, clearly not happy. ‘Well, you put your phone in as well — that’s only fair.’

    He laughs. ‘You always did have to have the last word, Alexandra, didn’t you?’

461,"Hippy Hippy Shake (From ""Cocktail"")","There are only fragments of me left now. Chunks of memory have broken free and drifted away like calved glaciers. It is always  like that when a Passenger leaves us. We can never be sure of all the things our borrowed bodies did. We have only the lingering traces,  the imprints.

Like sand clinging to an ocean-tossed bottle. Like the throbbings of amputated legs.

I rise. I collect myself. My hair is rumpled; I comb it. My face is creased from too little sleep. There is sourness in my mouth. Has my Passenger been eating dung with my mouth? They do that. They do anything.

It is morning.

A gray, uncertain morning. I stare at it awhile, and then, shuddering, I opaque the window and confront instead the gray, uncertain surface of the inner panel. My room looks untidy. Did I have a woman here? There are ashes in the trays. Searching for butts, I find several with lipstick stains. Yes, a woman was here.

I touched the bedsheets. Still warm with shared warmth. Both  pillows tousled. She has gone, though, and the Passenger is gone, and I am alone.

How long did it last, this time?

I pick up the phone and ring Central. “What is the date?”

The computer’s bland feminine voice replies, “Friday, December fourth, nineteen eighty-seven.”

“The time?”

“Nine fifty-one, Eastern Standard Time.”

“The weather forecast?”

“Predicted temperature range for today thirty to thirty-eight. Current temperature, thirty-one. Wind from the north, sixteen miles an hour. Chances of precipitation slight.”

“What do you recommend for a hangover?”

“Food or medication?”

“Anything you like,” I say.

The computer mulls that one over for a while. Then it decides on both, and activates my kitchen. The spigot yields cold tomato juice. Eggs begin to fry. From the medicine slot comes a purplish liquid. The Central Computer is always so thoughtful. Do the Passengers ever ride it, I wonder? What thrills could that hold for them? Surely it must be more exciting to borrow the million minds of Central than to live awhile in the short-circuited soul of a corroding human being!

December fourth, Central said. Friday. So the Passenger had me for three nights.

I drink the purplish stuff and probe my memories in a gingerly way, as one might probe a festering sore.

I remember Tuesday morning. A bad time at work. None of the charts will come out right. The section manager irritable; he has been taken by Passengers three times in five weeks, and his section is in disarray as a result, and his Christmas bonus is jeopardized. Even though it is customary not to penalize a person for lapses due to Passengers, according to the system, the section manager seems to feel he will be treated unfairly. So he treats us unfairly. We have a hard time. Revise the charts, fiddle with the program, check the fundamentals ten times over. Out they come: the detailed forecasts for price variations of public utility securities, February-April 1988. That afternoon we are to meet and discuss the charts and what they tell us.

I do not remember Tuesday afternoon.

That must have been when the Passenger took me. Perhaps at work; perhaps in the mahogany-paneled boardroom itself, during the conference. Pink concerned faces all about me; I cough, I lurch, I stumble from my seat. They shake their heads sadly. No one reaches for me. No one stops me. It is too dangerous to interfere with one who has a Passenger. The chances are great that a second Passenger lurks nearby in the discorporate state, looking for a mount. So I am avoided. I leave the building.

After that, what?

Sitting in my room on bleak Friday morning, I eat my scrambled eggs and try to reconstruct the three lost nights.

Of course it is impossible. The conscious mind functions during the period of captivity, but upon withdrawal of the Passenger nearly every recollection goes too. There is only a slight residue, a gritty film of faint and ghostly memories. The mount is never precisely the same person afterwards; though he cannot recall the details of his experience, he is subtly changed by it.

I try to recall.

A girl? Yes: lipstick on the butts. Sex, then, here in my room. Young? Old? Blonde? Dark? Everything is hazy. How did my borrowed body behave? Was I a good lover? I try to be, when I am myself. I keep in shape. At thirty-eight, I can handle three sets of tennis on a summer afternoon without collapsing. I can make a woman glow as a woman is meant to glow. Not boasting; just categorizing. We have our skills. These are mine.

But Passengers, I am told, take wry amusement in controverting our skills. So would it have given my rider a kind of delight to find me a woman and force me to fail repeatedly with her?

I dislike that thought.

The fog is going from my mind now. The medicine prescribed by Central works rapidly. I eat, I shave, I stand under the vibrator until my skin is clean. I do my exercises. Did the Passenger exercise my body Wednesday and Thursday mornings? Probably not. I must make up for that. I am close to middle age, now; tonus lost is not easily regained.

I touch my toes twenty times, knees stiff.

I kick my legs in the air.

I lie flat and lift myself on pumping elbows.

The body responds, maltreated though it has been. It is the first bright moment of my awakening: to feel the inner tingling, to know that I still have vigor.

Fresh air is what I want next. Quickly I slip into my clothes and leave. There is no need for me to report to work today. They are aware that since Tuesday afternoon I have had a Passenger; they need not be aware that before dawn on Friday the Passenger departed. I will have a free day. I will walk the city’s streets, stretching my limbs, repaying my body for the abuse it has suffered.

I enter the elevator. I drop fifty stories to the ground. I step out into the December dreariness.

The towers of New York rise about me.

In the street the cars stream forward. Drivers sit edgily at their wheels. One never knows when the driver of a nearby car will be borrowed, and there is always a moment of lapsed coordination as the Passenger takes over. Many lives are lost that way on our streets and highways; but never the life of a Passenger.

I begin to walk without purpose. I cross Fourteenth Street, heading north, listening to the soft violet purr of the electric engines. I see a  boy jigging in the street and know he is being ridden. At Fifth and Twenty-second a prosperous-looking paunchy man approaches, his necktie askew, this morning’s Wall Street Journal jutting from an overcoat pocket. He giggles. He thrusts out his tongue. Ridden. Ridden. I avoid him. Moving briskly, I come to the underpass that carries traffic below Thirty-fourth Street toward Queens, and pause for a moment to watch two adolescent girls quarreling at the rim of the pedestrian walk. One is a Negro. Her eyes are rolling in terror. The other pushes her closer to the railing. Ridden. But the Passenger does not have murder on its mind, merely pleasure. The Negro girl is released and falls in a huddled heap, trembling. Then she rises and runs. The other girl draws a long strand of gleaming hair into her mouth, chews on it, seems to awaken. She looks dazed.

I avert my eyes. One does not watch while a fellow sufferer is awakening. There is a morality of the ridden; we have so many new tribal mores in these dark days.

I hurry on.

Where am I going so hurriedly? Already I have walked more than a mile. I seem to be moving toward some goal, as though my Passenger still hunches in my skull, urging me about. But I know that is not so. For the moment, at least, I am free.

Can I be sure of that?

Cogito ergo sum no longer applies. We go on thinking even while we are ridden, and we live in quiet desperation, unable to half halt our courses no matter how ghastly, no matter how self-destructive. I am certain that I can distinguish between the condition of bearing a Passenger and the condition of being free. But perhaps not. Perhaps I bear a particularly devilish Passenger which has not quitted me at all, but which merely has receded to the cerebellum, leaving me the illusion of freedom while all the time surreptitiously driving me onward to some purpose of its own.

Did we ever have more than that: the illusion of freedom?

But this is disturbing, the thought that I may be ridden without realizing it. I burst out in heavy perspiration, not merely from the exertion of walking. Stop. Stop here. Why must you walk? You are at Forty-second Street. There is the library. Nothing forces you onward. Stop a while, I tell myself. Rest on the library steps.

I sit on the cold stone and tell myself that I have made this decision for myself.

Have I? It is the old problem, free will versus determinism, translated into the foulest of forms. Determinism is no longer a philosopher’s abstraction; it is cold alien tendrils sliding between the cranial sutures. The Passengers arrived three years ago. I have been ridden five times since then. Our world is quite different now. But we have adjusted even to this. We have adjusted. We have our mores. Life goes on. Our governments rule, our legislatures meet, our stock exchanges transact business as usual, and we have methods for compensating for the random havoc. It is the only way. What else can we do? Shrivel in defeat? We have an enemy we cannot fight; at best we can resist through endurance. So we endure.

The stone steps are cold against my body. In December few people sit here.

I tell myself that I made this long walk of my own free will, that I halted of my own free will, that no Passenger rides my brain now. Perhaps. Perhaps. I cannot let myself believe that I am not free.

Can it be, I wonder, that the Passenger left some lingering command in me? Walk to this place, halt at this place? That is possible too.

I look about me at the others on the library steps.

An old man, eyes vacant, sitting on newspaper. A boy of thirteen or so with flaring nostrils. A plump woman. Are all of them ridden? Passengers seem to cluster about me today. The more I study the ridden ones, the more convinced I become that I am, for the moment, free. The last time, I had three months of freedom between rides. Some people, they say, are scarcely ever free. Their bodies are in great demand, and they know only scattered bursts of freedom, a day here, a week there, an hour. We have never been able to determine how many Passengers infest our world. Millions, maybe. Or maybe five. Who can tell?

A wisp of snow curls down out of the gray sky. Central had said the chance of precipitation was slight. Are they riding Central this morning too?

I see the girl.

She sits diagonally across from me, five steps up and a hundred feet away, her black skirt pulled up on her knees to reveal handsome legs. She is young. Her hair is deep, rich auburn. Her eyes are pale; at this distance, I cannot make out the precise color. She is dressed simply. She is younger than thirty. She wears a dark green coat and her lipstick has a purplish tinge. Her lips are full, her nose slender, high-bridged, her eyebrows carefully plucked.

I know her.

I have spent the past three nights with her in my room. She is the one. Ridden, she came to me, and ridden, I slept with her. I am certain of this. The veil of memory opens; I see her slim body naked on my bed.

How can it be that I remember this?

It is too strong to be an illusion. Clearly this is something that I have been permitted to remember for reasons I cannot comprehend. And I remember more. I remember her soft gasping sounds of pleasure. I know that my own body did not betray me those three nights, nor did I fail her need.

And there is more. A memory of sinuous music; a scent of youth in her hair; the rustle of winter trees. Somehow she brings back to me a time of innocence, a time when I am young and girls are mysterious, a time of parties and dances and warmth and secrets.

I am drawn to her now.

There is an etiquette about such things, too. It is in poor taste to approach someone you have met while being ridden. Such an encounter gives you no privilege; a stranger remains a stranger, no matter what you and she may have done and said during your involuntary time together.

Yet I am drawn to her.

Why this violation of taboo? Why this raw breach of etiquette? I have never done this before. I have been scrupulous.

But I get to my feet and walk along the step on which I have been sitting, until I am below her, and I look up, and automatically she folds her ankles together and angles her knees as if in awareness that her position is not a modest one. I know from that gesture that she is not ridden now. My eyes meet hers. Her eyes are hazy green. She is beautiful, and I rack my memory for more details of our passion.

I climb step by step until I stand before her.

“Hello,” I say.

She gives me a neutral look. She does not seem to recognize me. Her eyes are veiled, as one’s eyes often are, just after the Passenger has gone. She purses her lips and appraises me in a distant way.

“Hello,” she replies coolly. “I don’t think I know you.”

“No. You don’t. But I have the feeling you don’t want to be alone just now. And I know I don’t.” I try to persuade her with my eyes that my motives are decent. “There’s snow in the air,” I say. “We can find a warmer place. I’d like to talk to you.”

“About what?”

“Let’s go elsewhere , and I’ll tell you. I’m Charles Roth.”

“Helen Martin.”

She gets to her feet. She still has not cast aside her cool neutrality; she is suspicious, ill at ease. But at least she is willing to go with me. A good sign.

“Is it too early in the day for a drink?” I ask.

“I’m not sure. I hardly know what time it is.”

“Before noon.”

“Let’s have a drink anyway,” she says, and we both smile.

We go to a cocktail lounge across the street. Sitting face to face in the darkness, we sip drinks, daiquiri for her, bloody mary for me. She relaxes a little. I ask myself what it is I want from her. The pleasure of her company, yes. Her company in bed? But I have already had that pleasure, three nights of it, though she does not know that. I want something more. Something more. What?

Her eyes are bloodshot. She has had little sleep these past three nights.

I say, “Was it very unpleasant for you?”

“What?”

“The Passenger.”

A whiplash of reaction crosses her face. “How did you know I’ve had a Passenger?”

“I know.”

“We aren’t supposed to talk about it.”

“I’m broadminded,” I tell her. `My Passenger left me some time during the night. I was ridden since Tuesday afternoon.”

“Mine left me about two hours ago, I think.” Her cheeks color. She is doing something daring, talking like this. “I was ridden since Monday night.”

We toy with our drinks. Rapport is growing, almost without the need of words. Our recent experiences with Passengers give us something in common, although Helen does not realize how intimately we shared those experiences.

We talk. She is a designer of display windows. She has a small apartment several blocks from here. She lives alone. She asks me what I do. “Securities analyst,” I tell her. She smiles. Her teeth are flawless. We have a second round of drinks. I am positive, now, that this is the girl who was in my room while I was ridden.

A seed of hope grows in me. It was a happy chance that brought us together again, so soon after we parted as dreamers. A happy chance, too, that some vestige of the dream lingered in my mind.

We have shared something, who knows what, and it must have been good to leave such a vivid imprint on me, and now I want to come to her conscious, aware, my own master, and renew that relationship, making it a real one this time. It is not proper, for I am trespassing on a privilege that is not mine except by virtue of our Passengers’ brief presence in us. Yet I need her. I want her.

She seems to need me, too, without realizing who I am. But fear holds her back.

I am frightened of frightening her, and I do not try to press my advantage too quickly. Perhaps she would take me to her apartment with her now, perhaps not, but I do not ask. We finish our drinks. We arrange to meet by the library steps again tomorrow. My hand momentarily brushes hers. Then she is gone.

I fill three ashtrays that night. Over and over I debate the wisdom of what I am doing. But why not leave her alone? I have no right to follow her. In the place our world has become, we are wisest to remain apart.

And yet— there is that stab of half-memory when I think of her. The blurred lights of lost chances behind the stairs, of girlish laughter in second-floor corridors, of stolen kisses, of tea and cake. I remember the girl with the orchid in her hair, and the one in the spangled dress, and the one with the child’s face and the woman’s eyes, all so long ago, all lost, all gone, and I tell myself that this one I will not lose, I will not permit her to be taken from me.

Morning comes, a quiet Saturday. I return to the library, hardly expecting to find her there, but she is there, on the steps, and the sight of her is like a reprieve. She looks wary, troubled; obviously she has done much thinking, little sleeping. Together we walk along Fifth Avenue. She is quite close to me, but she does not take my arm. Her steps are brisk, short, nervous.

I want to suggest that we go to her apartment instead of to the cocktail lounge. In these days we must move swiftly while we are free. But I know it would be a mistake to think of this as a matter of tactics. Coarse haste would be fatal, bringing me perhaps an ordinary victory, a numbing defeat within it. In any event her mood hardly seems promising. I look at her, thinking of string music and new snowfalls, and she looks toward the gray sky.

She says, “I can feel them watching me all the time. Like vultures swooping overhead, waiting, waiting. Ready to pounce.”

“But there’s a way of beating them. We can grab little scraps of life when they’re not looking.”

“They’re always looking.”

“No,” I tell her. “There can’t be enough of them for that. Sometimes they’re looking the other way. And while they are, two people can come together and try to share warmth.”

“But what’s the use?”

“You’re too pessimistic, Helen. They ignore us for months at a time. We have a chance. We have a chance.”

But I cannot break through her shell of fear. She is paralyzed by the nearness of the Passengers, unwilling to begin anything for fear it will be snatched away by our tormentors. We reach the building where she lives, and I hope she will relent and invite me in. For an instant she wavers, but only for an instant: she takes my hand in both of hers, and smiles, and the smile fades, and she is gone, leaving me only with the words, “Let’s meet at the library again tomorrow. Noon.”

I make the long chilling walk home alone.

Some of her pessimism seeps into me that night. It seems futile for us to try to salvage anything. More than that: wicked for me to seek her out, shameful to offer a hesitant love when I am not free. In this world, I tell myself, we should keep well clear of others, so that we do not harm anyone when we are seized and ridden.

I do not go to meet her in the morning.

It is best this way, I insist. I have no business trifling with her. I imagine her at the library, wondering why I am late, growing tense, impatient, then annoyed. She will be angry with me for breaking our date, but her anger will ebb, and she will forget me quickly enough.

Monday comes. I return to work.

Naturally, no one discusses my absence. It is as though I have never been away. The market is strong that morning. The work is challenging; it is mid-morning before I think of Helen at all. But once I think of her, I can think of nothing else. My cowardice in standing her up. The childishness of Saturday night’s dark thoughts. Why accept fate so passively? Why give in? I want to fight, now, to carve out a pocket of security despite the odds. I feel a deep conviction that it can be done. The Passengers may never bother the two of us again, after all. And that flickering smile of hers outside her building Saturday, that momentary glow—it should have told me that behind her wall of fear she felt the same hopes. She was waiting for me to lead the way. And I stayed home instead.

At lunchtime I go to the library, convinced it is futile.

But she is there. She paces along the steps; the wind slices at her slender figure. I go to her.

She is silent a moment. “Hello,” she says finally.

“I’m sorry about yesterday.”

“I waited a long time for you.”

I shrug. “I made up my mind that it was no use to come. But then I changed my mind again.”

She tries to look angry. But I know she is pleased to see me again—else why did she come here today? She cannot hide her inner pleasure. Nor can I. I point across the street to the cocktail lounge.

“A daiquiri?” I say. “As a peace offering?”

“All right.”

Today the lounge is crowded, but we find a booth somehow. There is a brightness in her eyes that I have not seen before. I sense that a barrier is crumbling within her.

“You’re less afraid of me, Helen,” I say.

“I’ve never been afraid of you. I’m afraid of what could happen if we take the risks.”

“Don’t be. Don’t be.”

“I’m trying not to be afraid. But sometimes it seems so hopeless. Since they came here—”

“We can still try to live our own lives.”

“Maybe.”

“We have to. Let’s make a pact, Helen. No more gloom. No more worrying about the terrible things that might just happen. All right?”

A pause. Then a cool hand against mine.

“All right.”

We finish our drinks, and I present my Credit Central to pay for them, and we go outside. I want her to tell me to forget about this afternoon’s work and come home with her. It is inevitable, now, that she will ask me, and better sooner than later.

We walk a block. She does not offer the invitation. I sense the struggle inside her, and I wait, letting that struggle reach its own resolution without interference from me. We walk a second block. Her arm is through mine, but she talks only of her work, of the weather, and it is a remote, arm’s-length conversation. At the next corner she swings around, away from her apartment, back toward the cocktail lounge. I try to be patient with her.

I have no need to rush things now, I tell myself. Her body is not a secret to me. We have begun our relationship topsy-turvy, with the physical part first; now it will take time to work backward to the more difficult part that some people call love.

But of course she is not aware that we have known each other that way. The wind blows swirling snowflakes in our faces, and somehow the cold sting awakens honesty in me. I know what I must say. I must relinquish my unfair advantage.

I tell her, “While I was ridden last week, Helen, I had a girl in my room.”

“Why talk of such things now?”

“I have to, Helen. You were the girl.”

She halts. She turns to me. People hurry past us in the street. Her face is very pale, with dark red spots growing in her cheeks.

“That’s not funny, Charles.”

“It wasn’t meant to be. You were with me from Tuesday night to early Friday morning.”

“How can you possibly know that?”

“I do. I do. The memory is clear. Somehow it remains, Helen. I see your whole body.”

“Stop it, Charles.”

“We were very good together,” I say. “We must have pleased our Passengers because we were so good. To see you again—it was like waking from a dream, and finding that the dream was real, the girl right there—”

“No!”

“Let’s go to your apartment and begin again.”

She says, “You’re being deliberately filthy, and I don’t know why, but there wasn’t any reason for you to spoil things. Maybe I was with you and maybe I wasn’t, but you wouldn’t know it, and if you did know it you should keep your mouth shut about it, and—”

“You have a birthmark the size of a dime,” I say, “about two inches below your left breast.”

She sobs and hurls herself at me, there in the street. Her long silvery nails rake my cheeks. She pummels me. I seize her. Her knees assail me. No one pays attention; those who pass by assume we are ridden, and turn their heads. She is all fury, but I have my arms around hers like metal bands, so that she can only stamp and snort, and her body is close against mine. She is rigid, anguished.

In a low, urgent voice I say, “We’ll defeat them, Helen. We’ll finish what they started. Don’t fight me. There’s no reason to fight me. I know, it’s a fluke that I remember you, but let me go with you and I’ll prove that we belong together.”

“Let—go—”

“Please. Please. Why should we be enemies? I don’t mean you any harm. I love you, Helen. Do you remember, when we were kids, we could play at being in love? I did; you must have done it too. Sixteen, seventeen years old. The whispers, the conspiracies—all a big game, and we knew it. But the game’s over. We can’t afford to tease and run. We have so little time, when we’re free—we have to trust, to open ourselves—”

“It’s wrong.”

“No. Just because it’s the stupid custom for two people brought together by Passengers to avoid one another, that doesn’t mean we have to follow it. Helen—Helen—”

Something in my tone registers with her. She ceases to struggle. Her rigid body softens. She looks up at me, her tearstreaked face thawing, her eyes blurred.

“Trust me,” I say. “Trust me, Helen!”

She hesitates. Then she smiles.







In that moment I feel the chill at the back of my skull, the sensation as of a steel needle driven deep through bone. I stiffen. My arms drop away from her. For an instant, I lose touch, and when the mists clear all is different.

“Charles?” she says. “Charles?”

Her knuckles are against her teeth. I turn, ignoring her, and go back into the cocktail lounge. A young man sits in one of the front booths. His dark hair gleams with pomade; his cheeks are smooth. His eyes meet mine.

I sit down. He orders drinks. We do not talk.

My hand falls on his wrist, and remains there. The bartender, serving the drinks, scowls but says nothing. We sip our cocktails and put the drained glasses down.

“Let’s go,” the young man says.

But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight",Ed Sheeran,1989,"[95, 80, 86]",3
465,Let's Put The X In Sex,"I got a letter just the other day
She sent a picture, but she didn't sign her name
She wore high heels and a little black lace
I knew her body, but I couldn't see her face
She didn't leave a number, not an address or a clue
But something in that photograph reminded me of you

[Chorus]
Baby, let's put the X in sex
Love's like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby, let's put the X in sex
Keep it undercover, baby, let me be your private eye

I got a call in the middle of the night
Heavy breathin' never sounded quite so nice
She said ""Oo yeah, I wish that I was there""
I asked who was calling, but she wasn't playing fair
Sometimes you gotta suffer for the pleasure that you seek
You're beggin' for an eyeful but you only get a peek

[Chorus]
Baby, let's put the X in sex
Love's like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby, let's put the X in sex
Keep it undercover, baby let me be your private eye

[Guitar solo]
Whoa yeah
Yeah!

I heard somebody knockin' so I opened up the door
She wore a hat, shades, and a trench coat
Wasn't wearin' that much more
She said she knew my secrets but I didn't have a clue
Then I saw those black lace panties and I knew that it was you

[Chorus]
Baby, let's put the X in sex
Love's like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby, let's put the X in sex
Keep it undercover, baby let me be your private eye

Let's put the X in sex
Love's like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby, let's put the X in sex
Keep it undercover, baby let me be your private eye

Let's put the X in sex
Love's like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby, let's put the X in sex
Keep it undercover, baby let me be your private eye

Let's put the X in sex
Love's like a muscle and you make me wanna flex

466,It's Money That Matters,"Of all of the people that I used to know
Most never adjusted to the great big world
I see 'em lurking in bookstores
Workin' for the public radio
Carryin' their babies around in sacks on their backs
Movin' careful and slow

It's money that matters
Hear what I say
It's money that matters
In the U.S.A

All of these people are much brighter than I
In any fair system they would flourish and thrive
But they barely survive
They eke out a living
They barely survive

When I was a young boy, maybe thirteen
I took a hard look around me, asked ""What does it mean?""

So I talked to my father; he didn't know
I talked to my friend; he didn't know
I talked to my brother; he didn't know
I talked to everybody that I knew

It's money that matters
Now, you know that it's true
It's money that matters
Whatever you do

I talked to a man lived up on the county line
I was washin' his car with a friend of mine

He was a little fat guy in a red jumpsuit
I said, ""That looks kinda funny""; he said, ""I know it does too -
But I got a great big house on the hill here
Great big blonde wife inside it
Great big pool in my back yard
Another great big pool beside it!

Sonny, it's money that matters
Hear what I say
It's money that matters
In the U.S.A

It's money that matters
Now, you know that it's true
It's money that matters
Whatever you do""",Randy Newman,1989,"[100, 83, 77]",3
467,Kissing A Fool,"You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough
To even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind
'Til you listen to your heart

People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart from you

People
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So goodbye
But please don't take my heart

You are far
I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough
I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind
While I listen to my heart

People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart from you

People
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Ba da da ah ah ah

But remember this
Every other kiss
That you ever give
Long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you like I always do
There's something there
That can't compare with any other

You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too
Guess you were kissing a fool

You must have been kissing a fool",George Michael,1989,"[82, 65]",2

470,Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble,"[Intro: Fresh Prince]
Listen homeboys don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Verse One]
Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said: ""You're kind of cute"" I said: ""Yes, I know, but...
By the way, sweetheart, what's your name?""
She said: ""My friends like to call me exotic Elaine""
I said: ""My name is the Prince"" and she said: ""Why?""
I said: ""Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!
But enough about me, yo, let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do""
I popped some trash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me 'did I like her?' I said: ""Well... kinda""
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said: ""You better stop buggin'!""
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: ""Rape!""
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with aggravated assault
(Yo Clancy we got him) but it wasn't my fault!

[Chorus: Fresh Prince]
Nevertheless don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Verse Two]
I was in a bar one Friday night
Cooling watching a Mike Tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on tequila
When this girl walked up she said: ""Hi, my name is Sheila""
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said: ""Let's go""
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said: ""I'm with you, toots""
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said: ""Oh, your hands are cold!""
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said: ""Baby, where are you?""
Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin
And said: ""Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb!""
I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?
I just yelled: ""Geronimo!"" and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done, sneezing and coughing...
I hope this doesn't happen too often, but

[Chorus: The Fresh Prince]
Nevertheless don't mean to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Spoken interlude]
[Jazzy] Yo man you think they see your point?
[Prince] I don't know, I don't think they really do...
[Jazzy] I think you should give 'em another example
[Prince] Awright, give me a scratch let's make it funky right here

[Verse Three]
I got a ring on my phone May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty I said: ""Hello dear!
I was just about to call you
I got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert"" (I'm wit it)
""It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready?"" (Yeah)
""Aight, fine, see you then, Betty""
I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif
Got to Betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mom said: ""Betty's not ready yet""
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said: ""I need a little longer to finish my hair""
At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!?
""Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!""
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home

[Outro: Fresh Prince]
But it just goes to show not trying to burst your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme
Just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

[Outro]
[Jazzy] Man, first your parents just don't understand...
[Jazzy] Then you have these crazy nightmares...
[Prince] I know, why me, man? Why me?...
[Jazzy] What's next?
[Prince] Not these girls man, but... you know how it is... can't live wit 'em...

Don't ask me what you know is true
Don't have to tell you, oh, I love your precious heart

[Chorus]
I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collide
And they could never, ever tear us apart

And we could live for a thousand years
But if I hurt you, I'd make wine from your tears
Oh, I told you that we could fly
'Cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know why

Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart, oh, oh, oh
And they could never, ever tear us apart, oh, oh, oh

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites

[Verse 1]
When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No

[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

[Verse 2]
When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy

But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high-post but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my heart to you
You should be giving me your heart too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you twelve yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl is like a heart attack
I'm a real troop trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side, d-dollars I will clock

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool (Hoo)

Don't be cruel
I know, oh

[Verse 4]
We used to hang out tough, just kicking around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Lo to the fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', trying to make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willing
To be with me, Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be, and if you wanna be with me

I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I've seen you look at strangers too many times
The love you want is of a different kind

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
Remember when we felt the sun?
A love like paradise, how hot it burned
A threat of distant thunder, the sky was red
And when you walked, you always turned every head

But now I know you play a different game
I've watched you dance with danger, still wanting more

478,"Boy, I've Been Told","[Verse 1:]
Looking in your eyes
I see a memory
Of how it used to be
Before our world came tumbling down

I try
I did nothing else
But try to keep our love alive
Oh, how I loved you so
And you just made me cry

Did you deceive me?
Did you do me wrong?
Boy, I can`t take it
Can`t take it anymore

I feel so helpless
Not knowing what to do
Do I keep on crying?
Or do I leave you?

[Chorus:]
Boy, I`ve been told
Leaving you is the thing to do
It would be easy
If I didn`t want to start anew

Boy, I`ve been told
Leaving you is the thing to do
It won`t be easy
Cause breaking up is hard to do

[Verse 2:]
Touch this lonely heart
As I try to say to you
About the things you do
Now I`m alone
Dissatisfied

Did you deceive me?
Did you do me wrong?
Boy, I can`t take it
Can`t take it anymore

I feel so helpless
Not knowing what to do
Do I keep on crying?
Or do I leave you?

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Just like my friend said
You were never good for me
So just go about your way
Don`t worry about me
And just forget we ever happened

The time has come to say goodbye
Don`t ask why
Just let it all go
I`ve made it through
There`s someone new

[Repeat Chorus x2:]",Safire,1989,[93],1
479,Till I Loved You,"Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
You were my friend, good friend
And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
Possibly be you?
I was lost, I was blind
Till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you

Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment when I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you
When I loved you
Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
Empty days, empty nights
Sometimes I wonder
Could the one to save me possibly be you?
Ooooohh I was lost, I was blind till I found you
Couldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You came along, stole my heart completely
And I thought, could the one to save me possibly be you?",Barbra Streisand,1989,[99],1
480,Is It Love,"[Verse]
How can I do this?
I've never felt this way before
You keep on staring at me
And I can't take it anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
But I want you to know
I'm looking for a place where we can go
And I can say the words as I'm tryin break through
But you already know that I really want you

[Chorus]
Is it love, love, love
Love, love, love that I'm feeling?
Is it love, love, love
Love, love, love that I'm feeling?
Is she the one, one, one
One, one, one that I'm dreaming of?
Is it love? Is it love?

[Bridge]
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
Is it love, love, love
Love, love, love that I'm feeling?
Is it love, love, love
Love, love, love that I'm feeling?
Is she the one, one, one
One, one, one that I'm dreaming of?

Is it love, love, love
Love, love, love that I'm feeling?",3LAU,1989,[100],1
