0,Walk Like An Egyptian,"All the old paintings on the tombs
They do the sand dance don't you know
If they move too quick (oh whey oh)
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh whey oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say

(Chorus)
Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh whey oh)
You drop your drink then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh whey oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say

(Repeat Chorus)
Slide your feetup the street bend your back
Shift your arm then pull it back
Life's hard you know (oh whey oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh whey oh)
Spin the clubs cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh whey oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say

(Repeat Chorus)

1,Everybody Have Fun Tonight,"I'll drive a million miles
To be with you tonight
So if you're feeling low
Turn up your radio
The words we use are strong
They make reality
But now the music's on
Oh, baby, dance with me, yeah

Rip it up, move down
Rip it up, move it down to the ground
Rip it up, cool down
Rip it up, don't hang me on the borderline

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun

Deep in the world tonight
Our hearts beat safe and sound
I'll hold you so close
Just let yourself go down

Rip it up, move down
Rip it up, move it down to the ground
Rip it up, cool down
Rip it up, get out what's inside of you

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight

Everybody have fun

On the edge of oblivion

A celebration, so spread the word

2,Notorious,"[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Post-Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)
Junior Mafia, mad flavor (Bad Boy)
Uh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch)

[Chorus: Total]
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

[Outro: Puff Daddy & Total]
Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga
Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga
It's all good
That's right, '94
And on and on, and on and on
You know very well
It's all good
Who you are
Yeah
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars

4,The Way It Is,"[Verse 1]
Standin' in line, marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun, he says ""Get a job""

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

[Verse 2]
Said, ""Hey little boy, you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do""
Said, ""Hey old man, how can you stand to think that way?
Did you really think about it before you made the rules?""
He said

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

[Verse 3]
Well, they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got, a little more
But it only goes so far
'Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar
But who knows

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is",Bruce Hornsby and the Range,1986,"[5, 2, 1, 4, 8, 9, 14, 18, 27, 30, 40, 49, 60, 70, 86]",15
5,C'est La Vie,"Combien faut-il de temps pour accepter le sort ?
Combien faut-il de bières pour inhiber sa peur ?
Combien faut-il de pleurs pour pouvoir rire encore
Du fait d'être vivant en attendant la mort ?

R. C'est pas moi qui suis aigri, c'est la vie qu'est mortelle
Qui te sort de ton nid et te rogne les ailes
C'est pas moi qui suis aigri, c'est la vie qu'est mortelle

Combien faut-il de jours pour accepter la nuit ?
Combien faut-il de cuites pour vaincre l'insomnie ?
Est-ce vraiment le vin ou la vie qui m'écoeure
Quand elle choisit ton heure alors que je vomis ?

R. C'est pas moi qui suis aigri, c'est la vie qu'est mortelle
Qui te sort de ton nid et te rogne les ailes
C'est pas moi qui suis aigri, c'est la vie qu'est mortelle
Allez, tournez, allez valsez...

Faut-il être inconscient pour garder la raison
Quand de ceux qu'on aimait on écoute l'oraison
Que ruissellent à nos yeux les larmes du malheur
Serre-moi contre ton coeur, j'ai besoin d'illusion

R. (à Gégène)
C'est pas moi qui suis aigri, c'est la vie qu'est mortelle
Qui te sort de ton nid et te rogne les ailes

6,Control,"[Produced by No I.D.]

[Intro: Big Sean]
Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history

I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal line me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchy
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip, when we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way-way less
I know you try get one down on us ever since then it's been stressed
'Cause you know the reps dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin'; I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Ring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301 won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has code names, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

Before my heart starts to burn

Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know

Maybe you and I will not believe in
The things we find behind the door

Pray silence, I'm begging
Too tired to tell you I ain't coming home
Stop for a second
Guess I got caught up in leading you on
And I ain't responsible for the lump in your throat

Haven't you had enough of all of this?
Haven't you had enough of loneliness?

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to stay too long
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to tell you whatever you want
But haven't you had enough of loneliness?
And haven't we had enough of second best?
So don't get me wrong

Innocent then
Way back before we knew how to pretend
Picking up where we left
It ain't meant to be easy, shouldn't be hard as this
And I ain't responsible for letting this go

Haven't you had enough of all of this?
Haven't you had enough of loneliness?

But haven't you had enough of loneliness?

(To be a lover)
Haven't I proven in many ways
That with you is where I want to be
Haven't I shown you every day
Just how much you mean to me
But you keep on leading me
Leading me astray
Is this the price
That I have to pay

Haven't I done just what you wanted
And I been there whenever you call

Is this the price
That I have to pay
If I'm not, I'm not
The one that you wanted
Then why won't you turn me
Loose, loose, loose, baby
Why do you wanna hold
Hold on to me

12,Land Of Confusion,"[Verse 1]
I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now did you read the news today ?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

[Pre-Chorus]
There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

[Verse 2]
Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago...

[Verse 3]
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

[Chorus/Outro]
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying

Just where our lives are going to",Genesis,1986,"[13, 16, 20, 26, 28, 34, 37, 49, 64]",9

One, one two
Check me out right here yo

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
You can turn the track up a little bit for me
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
All up in my ears
Better now than never, business before pleasure
The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight (YEAH!)
So when you hear somethin', make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up
Our music keeps you movin', what are you provin'?
Turn that shit all the way up, yeah
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Music's gettin' louder
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
This shit is hot!
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nuthin' but choked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats
I'ma win 'cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uhh) you rakin' up plaques

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the Feds hate me
The son of (*Satan*), they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin', your fam' destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone - Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Cristal keep spillin' shit; you overdid it holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me the underboss
Of this holocaust, truly yours, Frank White

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?

To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin' like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, we just macin' them, placin' them
In fune-rals, criminals turned aroused
To Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman
Y'all just betray men, we spray men, I position competition
Another day in the life of the commission

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?

Ayo, can you hear me out there?

When you're standing before me

Have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you?
'Cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you?
Oh, come on, you know me too well
And how can I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know I would never hurt you

No, no, no!

What did you think
I would give at this moment?
If you'd just stay, I'd subtract
Twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

I'd fall down on my knees
Kiss the ground that you walk on, baby
If I could just hold you
Mmmmm
If I could just hold you
I would fall down, down on my knees
Oh, God, please...
Let me hold you, let me hold you again

Woooooh, Wooooohh

24,Coming Around Again,"Baby sneezes
Mommy pleases
Daddy breezes in

So good on paper
So romantic
But so bewildering

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again

So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart (Broken heart)

You pay the grocer
Fix the toaster
You kiss the host goodbye

Then you break a window
Burn the souffle
Scream a lullaby

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again

So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart (Broken heart)

And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you

I know nothing stays the same (Stays the same)
But if you're willing to play the game (Play the game)
It's coming around again

(Baby sneezes) (I believe in love)
(Mommy pleases) (I believe in love)
(Daddy breezes in) (I believe in love)

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It will be coming around again

I do believe, I do believe (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)
Coming around again, coming around again

I know nothing stays the same (I believe in love)
But if you're willing to play the game (I believe in love)
It will be coming around again (I believe in love)

I believe in love (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)

25,Change Of Heart,"Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part

For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart

I'll quote ""on the road"" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Instrumental Interlude]

You smashed a glass into pieces
That's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette

You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

And she said, ""I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that""

You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart

I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh I just had a change of heart

Then she said, ""I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'""
Oh, I just had a change of heart
​
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
Oh, I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart",The 1975,1986,"[26, 32, 40, 52, 67]",5

Ah, touch me, touch me
This is the night
Touch me, touch me
I wanna feel your body

Full moon in the city and the night was young
I was hungry for love, I was hungry for fun

Quick as a flash you disappeared into the night

This is the time we've got to get it right (this is the night)

Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)

Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight, kind of side to side
He asked this old lady, ""Yo, yo, um...is this Kentucky Fried?""
The lady said ""Yeah"", smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fries, Big Mac!

I ain't talked to you since the day that you was trippin'
I look at your pictures, you've been making bad decisions, hangin' with a bunch of bitches who got all these bad intentions

39,Stop To Love,"[Verse 1:]
Lately love keeps keeping me wake at night
Tossing and turning, my love
Wanna kiss, wanna hold you so tight

Ooh, but I wonder love
Whether you know or not
When you just hurry away
Leaving me laying there in shock

I just wanna be
The one that you wanna see
I just wanna have you near me

But you fly away
Almost every day
You work a lot
You never stop to love

[Chorus:]
(Stop)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love

And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got

Say you're coming home
(Gotta stop to love)

[Verse 2:]
You say my love
Has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you
When you keep working overtime?

Too many empty nights
Can make almost any guy roam
To look for the love he don't get
Whenever he's at home alone

Awaiting the day
That you're coming to stay
I hate to see you go away

But you couldn't rest
Had to be the best
To reach the top
But you did not stop to love

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
And one day you'll discover
I'm the one who loves you
(Gotta stop to love)

And no one does you better
Can't you stay forever

I can hardly stand the loneliness
Come on stay
Cause that's what it's all about
You really turn me out

I love you, stop

Love you, stop

Come home from the road
Got to stop to love

And let's celebrate

Why do our dreams go wrong?
Why can't we all belong?

Oh, and tell me when
When will we ever learn?
There's nowhere else we can turn
The truth is in our hearts
Here we are together

Sometimes the road gets hard to travel
Sometimes the pain's too much to bear
Sometimes when life seems to unravel
That's the time oh to say
We're going to make it anyway

Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Here we stand trying not to fall

Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all
Over him

Once I met you I let go

44,Goldmine,"[Verse 1]
This phone isn't the greatest, well, for writing songs
But a vessel nonetheless for fantasies and shrouded thoughts
And as the light comes in and lays in wait across my wall
I gather all I've got and toss the veil once and for all
I'd like to say that it's just fine
Could never be a wasted night
5 AM before the light
And if you wake up feeling right
Just give me a call, it won't be awful
I lose sleep to think of you, I find it awesome

[Hook]
I've been looking pretty hard
But I come up empty
I've been thinking that the only one
For you, is me
Baby, baby
Babe

[Verse 2]
Laying here in bed, this blue pen and pad in hand
I try to face the fact that I think you're the one
I have just embraced the laughs and all the good fun that we've had
I want to tell you so, but I don't think you'd understand
You sure have a funny way of playing with emotions
Mixing up a strange little potion
Etched in red and number 9
Ten, eleven
And seven minutes in heaven
Think I'd kill to spin the bottle with you on the other side
Or even be at a party or when you didn't try
To hit on one of my friends only then to pass me by
Just give me a call, it won't be awful
I lose sleep to think of you, I find it awesome

Fall back
Take a look at me
And you'll see I'm for real
I feel what only I can feel
And if that don't appeal to you
Let me know
And I'll go
Because I flow
Better when my colors show
And that's the way it has to be

'Cuz creativity could never bloom
In my room
I'd throw it all away before I lie

You don't know
You think you know me like yourself
But I fear
That you're only telling me what I wanna hear

Understand
That I can't not be what I am

50,Wild Wild Life,"[Verse 1]
Well, how come you only want tomorrow?
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms
Strength in your stride and hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - I guess the season is on

[Verse 2]
So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And you push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul, are you one of the New Wave boys?

[Verse 3]
Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
""Well, David, what shall I do? They wait for me in the hallway""
I'll say ""Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways""
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me

[Chorus]
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

[Bridge]
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

[Verse 4]
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No, no

[Chorus]
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

[Verse 5]
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past
Who'll whisper low I miss you he really had to go
Well, each to his own, he was another piece of teenage wildlife
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Another piece of teenage wild... life

Find me rushing off to school every morning
Never had a care
Acting crazy, always laughing when I'm running

Stealing kisses in the hall before the first bell

Though we'd just met I guess you knew me so well
You had the number to my heart line

On the average twice a week I think I see you
On some avenue
Someone laughs or shakes his head they way you used to

Well, I've had some fun (Oh, I've had fun)
But you never need to question my intentions
'Cause each guy is just another rerun

An African-American man carrying two J.C. Penny shopping bags is ushered past the department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at
the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms.

CUT TO:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON

A bed has been formed by a chair and three benches.

A STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained.

She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it, but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING.

She's just given birth.

There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her with quiet smiles.

A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags.

SALESWOMAN
This is Mr. Mathison. He's a doctor.

DR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman.

DR. MATHISON
You okay?

The woman nods, ""Yes."" Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM.

SALESWOMAN
An ambulance is on the way.

Dr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms.

DR. MATHISON
Is there a name yet?

Beat. The woman smiles for the first time.

WOMAN
Elijah.

She hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES SEEM TO GET LOUDER.

WOMAN
Is he supposed to be crying like that?

The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him.

The woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time.

WOMAN
Can I have him back?

THE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat.

The doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body.

He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room.

DR. MATHISON
What happened during the delivery?

His hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up.

OLDER SALESWOMAN
Nothing. It was very quick.
The baby just wanted to come
right out. There was no
problems.

DR. MATHISON
Did you drop him?

Everyone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM.

DR. MATHISON
Did you drop this baby?

Beat.

OLDER SALESWOMAN
Jesus Christ, no.

The BABY SCREAMS.

The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear. He looks up to the saleswoman who brought him in.

DR. MATHISON
Please inform the ambulance we have a situation...

Dr. Mathison turns back to the mother. Beat.

DR. MATHISON
I've never seen this... It appears your infant sustained some fractures while in your uterus.
(beat)His arms and legs are broken.

FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. TRAIN STATION NEW JERSEY - DAY

LEGEND ""PRESENT DAY""

A fountain of humanity bubbles up from the escalators to the train platform.

Businessmen take their last desperate drags of their cigarettes... Women traveling with children herd their luggage and offspring into tight shapes as they move... College students with backpacks look around dazed at the various track numbers.

ANNOUNCER(o.s.)
Last call track three, Amtrak Clocker making it's
final stop at Philadelphia's thirtieth street station.
First two passenger cars only. First two cars only.

A face inside the train watches the stream of passengers emerging from the escalators. DAVID DUNNE, a man in his early forties, rest his temple against the glass and quietly observes the movement outside.

The train starts to pull out.

CUT TO:

INT. PASSENGER CAR - DAY

David sits with his coat on his lap. He's wearing a tie. He doesn't look very
comfortable in it.

He feels a stare. He looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at
him from over the seat in front of him. She just gazes at him blankly.

He gives her a small forced smile. She doesn't react. David returns his head to
the window.

His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train.

WOMAN(o.s.)
You alone?

David looks in the direction of THE VOICE. A WOMAN with dark hair and light blue
eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder. She's wearing a tight
white t-shirt and jeans. She's beautiful.

David nods ""yes.""

The woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats. She stretches to
get them up. Her toned stomach is exposed. She has a silver ring pierced through
her navel.

David has a gold ring on his hand. He fiddles with it. Beat. He gently slips off
his wedding band. It goes into his coat pocket.

The woman takes the seat next to him.

Beat. A LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. The passenger car shakes as a passing
train barrels by two feet from David's window. It passes in a few seconds. The
car returns to a QUIET HUM.

David pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him.

He holds the woman's fashion magazine out.

DAVID
Someone left these. You want
one?

The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports
Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket.

David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.

DAVID
You like sports?

WOMAN
It's my field. I represent
athletes. I'm an agent.

DAVID
What a coincidence? I'm a
male synchronized swimmer
and I'm looking for
representation.

WOMAN(smiling)
Is that right?

DAVID
But I'm afraid of water, so
that's been holding my
career back a little bit.

The woman laughs.

DAVID
You represent someone in
Philadelphia?

WOMAN
I'm meeting a player from
Temple University. He's a
cornerback. You like
football?

Beat.

DAVID
Not really.

WOMAN
This kid is six foot two,
two hundred and forty
pounds. He runs the fifty in
under six seconds. He's
going to be a God.

Beat. David studies the excitement in her eyes.

ANOTHER LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. David waits till the opposing train passes.
The woman goes back to her magazine. Beat.

DAVID
I'm David Dunne.

The woman looks up.

WOMAN
Kelly.

She goes back to the magazine.

Beat.

DAVID
How long are you staying in
Philly?

KELLY looks up from her Sports Illustrated. Her striking blue eyes gaze at David.
Beat.

She holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger.

KELLY(soft)
I'm married.

DAVID(fake excitement)
Great.

Beat.

KELLY
Sorry.

DAVID(fake confusion)
What are you talking about?

An awkward silence.

DAVID
I think you got the wrong
idea.

The woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine.

KELLY
I'm going to find another
seat.

Kelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She
starts to the back of the car.

David sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water.

He feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the
seats.

David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his
coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on.

His temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes
closed... Beat.

David's head bounces lightly against the window.

The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close.

He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger.

He looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat.

David turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the
train is picking up speed.

The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified.

The WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN.

The train goes faster.

AND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO
TAKE A CURVE.

David's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer
watching him.

DAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop
away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE...

THE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE
TRACK...

CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON

A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television
upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red
face. He changes channels with a remote control.

He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops
on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat.

His knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto
the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF
A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes.

Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a
notepad. On it is written...

""Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm.""

Jeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters
that move from right to left are words and numbers...""The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed...Amtrak""

Jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. He makes a small desperate noise
that no one hears.

CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured
helpless scream.

MEGAN DUNNE continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as
far as it will go.

She counts to three and eases off. She lays her arm back in her lap.

WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER. About a dozen people are on specialized
weight machines.

The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.

MEGAN
You okay, Virginia?

Beat. VIRGINIA shakes her head, ""No.""

MEGAN
I'll put something on the
t.v. Maybe we'll find some
almost naked guys to inspire
you.

Megan reaches up to the t.v. monitor mounted on the wall. She turns it on and
starts flipping channels. She stops on ESPN where a swimming meet is underway.
Men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool.

Virginia starts watching with great interest.

Megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen. Her
face goes still as she reads the train number... 177.

CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON

DAVID DUNNE'S EYES SLOWLY OPEN. THE DULL WHITE OF THE OVERHEAD TUBE LIGHTING
BLINDS HIM AT FIRST.

He blinks his vision back. He realizes he's in a bed.

WE HEAR AGITATED VOICES, MOVEMENT.

David looks around. He's in an emergency room. There are a half dozen prep areas
and beds next to him. They're all empty.

DAVID FOLLOWS THE URGENT SOUNDS OF ACTIVITY TO A PREP AREA DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM
HIM.

He can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain. A group of
emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on
a gurney.

One of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain. He
notices David sitting up from across the room.

THE MAN IN SCRUBS leaves the group and walks over.

MAN IN SCRUBS
How are you feeling?

DAVID
Okay.

He FLASHES A LIGHT in David's eyes.

MAN IN SCRUBS
You are in the emergency
room of the University of
Pennsylvania Hospital. You
were in a serious accident.
(beat)
How's your vision?

DAVID
Fine.

David stares across as the scene with the other patients becomes more frantic and
disturbing.

MAN IN SCRUBS
Where were you sitting on
the train?

DAVID
Against a window.

MAN IN SCRUBS
In the passenger car?

DAVID
Yes. Where are the rest of
the passengers?

MAN IN SCRUBS
Was your family traveling
with you?

DAVID
No.

MAN IN SCRUBS
Did you get up from your
seat?

DAVID
No.

David watches the other patient.

MAN IN SCRUBS
You're certain you were in
the passenger car?

David turns to the man.

DAVID
Yes... Why are you looking
at me like that?

Beat.

MAN IN SCRUBS
Your train derailed... Some
kind of malfunction... It
took a curve way to fast. A
second train collided with
yours after it derailed. The
debris is spread over one
mile. It's unbelievable they
said.
(beat)
They only found two people
alive so far... You and him.

David looks to the other passenger now laying unnaturally still in the desperate
whirlwind of activity around him.

MAN IN SCRUBS
The man's skull was cracked
open and most of his left
side was crushed.

Beat.

MAN IN SCRUBS
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons why
I'm looking at you like
this.

David turns and stares at the man.

MAN IN SCRUBS
One, because it seems, in a
few minutes, you will
officially be the only
survivor of this train
wreck.
(beat)
And two, because you don't
have a scratch on you. You
didn't break one bone.

CUT TO:

INT. EMERGENCY RECEPTION AREA - EVENING

David moves through the depressing milky corridors of the hospital. He opens a
set of double doors.

A room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement.

A CHILD'S VOICE BREAKS THEIR NOISE.

JEREMY
I told you!

Jeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras. He bursts out
and runs to David. He wraps his arms around David's waist. David just stands
there, aware that the cameras are catching it all. He's overwhelmed.

Hospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back.

Jeremy tugs David to lean down. He does.

JEREMY
They thought everybody on
the train died.

David looks at his son's face. Wipes the tears on his cheek.

JEREMY
I told them they were wrong.

A woman moves to them. David stands up and faces Megan Dunne.

JEREMY
Mom even cried.

David looks at Megan's eyes.

JEREMY
A lot.

Megan looks away.

MEGAN
Not a lot.

They stand there for a moment. David looks shaken. Jeremy takes hold of his hand.

JEREMY
Let's go home.

Megan nods. They move to the exit. The pack of cameras and reporters burst to
life as they leave the building. They jockey for position to get a last glimpse
of David Dunne.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

David eats a bowl of pasta alone in a modest kitchen. He stares at his hand.
Opens and closes it slowly. Beat.

He rises and puts the bowl away in the sink.

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

David stops just before rising the stairs. He glances into a bedroom at the
bottom of the stairs. The doorway is half open. He makes eye contact with his
wife. Beat.

DAVID
I don't think I got the job
in New York.

MEGAN
What does that mean?

DAVID
I'm still going to New York.
Just not this second.

MEGAN
I don't want to drag this
out too long for Jeremy.

DAVID
I know.

Beat.

DAVID
How about in the meantime,
you don't sleep in the
guestroom anymore?
(beat)
You sleep in our room. I'll
sleep down here.

Beat.

MEGAN
It stopped being our room a
long time ago.
(beat)
You should go up and get
some rest.

Beat. Megan slowly closes the door to the guest bedroom.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

David looks at his son asleep in his bed.

DAVID
Jeremy, why don't you go
sleep with your mom?

JEREMY(eyes closed)
I want to sleep here
tonight.

DAVID
I think it's be better if I
was alone.

JEREMY(eyes closed)
I won't make any noise.

DAVID
How about your room then? If
you get scared like before,
you can come back in here?

Beat. Jeremy doesn't answer because he's asleep. David rubs his forehead and gets
up. He turns on the t.v., low volume, as he moves into the bathroom.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Hot water rushes over David's face as he stands in the shower. His attention is
drawn to the t.v. which is seen through the slightly open bathroom door.

He turns off the water to HEAR.

NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)
...Derailed approximately
seven and half miles outside
Philadelphia. It came to
rest on its side on the
northbound tracks. It is
train officials belief that
some if not most of the
passengers were still alive
at this time.

NEWS ANCHOR(t.v.)
The momentary peace lasted
only a few seconds. A Boston
bound freight train on the
northbound tracks was
seconds away from passing
train 177 when it derailed.
The impact happened at about
three-fifteen p.m. The first
of the two occupied
passenger cars was severed
in half and sent careening
in two directions. The
second of the passenger cars
was crushed and dragged for
four hundred feet. Six crew
members were on the freight.
One hundred and eighteen
passengers and seven crew
members were on the
passenger train... There is
one reported survivor.
(beat)
Rescue teams will be working
for the next forty-eight
hours removing bodies and
debris.

David steps out of the shower. He sees a glimpse of Jeremy asleep in bed. David
shuts the door. Locks it.

He gets back into the shower and turns the water back on.

He closes his eyes. His face tightens up. He slowly hunches down and takes a seat
on the tiled floor of the shower. Water pours over him. Beat.

His muscular body begins to shake. Then we realize he's crying.

FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. FAIR - DAY

LEGEND ""1969""

A hazy afternoon. A fair has come into town. They have set up in the vast parking
lot of the local high school.

A line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms.

The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line.
She is older and somehow more beautiful.

She stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy. The boy
wears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized
stuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF
VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful
rides in the parking lot.

The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out.

Elijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic
bathroom. She turns back and gives him a look.

MOTHER
We'll play the water pistol
game next.

Elijah nods, ""Yes"" happily.

The mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of
women. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah
doesn't like it. He moves away from the line.

A CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows
the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK.
CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.

For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.

He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.

A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.

Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... ""The Hurricane.""

He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull
the metal bars down in front of them.

The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile.

Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under
the turnstile and climbs onto the platform.

Elijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment
and sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him.

He looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too.

His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His
expression changes.

Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their
softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's
wedged in between them. Feels good.

He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah
looks a little anxious. Beat.

He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before
he ties the arms together. He checks its softness.

Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an
eight year old smile of pride.

AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.

He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her
calling.

MOTHER
Elijah...

She moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The
Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes
immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments.

Her eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still.

A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up.

Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running.

ELIJAH
I won't get hurt momma! I'm
safe!

HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY.

The platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped
man. She's pointing at Elijah.

The platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's
angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.

And then the ride speeds up.

The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.

Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.

Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone
grabs the metal bars to hold on.

Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him
and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed
animal.

Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over
the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels.

Elijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes.

THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN.

THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions
suddenly.

Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the
compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR
SOMETHING CRACK.

TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN.

The ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling
clouds in a mixture of agony and terror.

The ride changes directions.

Elijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest.
WE HEAR MORE CRACKS.

The world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the
floor of the compartment.

And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual
stop.

THE TEENAGERS MOAN.

Elijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him.

WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE.

MOTHER(o.s.)
His bones... He's not
well...

HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM.

MOTHER(o.s.)
Elijah baby...

Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to
scream.

Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The
other is curved horrifically like an ""s"". His mouth is open. His eyes are
bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year
old child about to black out from the pain.

FADE TO BLACK:

PRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across
from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are
recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church.

David is among the arriving crowd.

MAN(o.s.)
David Dunne!

At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter
called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as
the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face.

David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, ""Services for
the families and friends of train 177.""

CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON

A PRIEST stands before a podium.

PRIEST
Sarah Elaston, social worker
at Broad and Locust
Community Center. We pray
for your soul.
(beat)
Kevin Elliott, business man,
father of six. We pray for
your soul.
(beat)
Glen Stevens, researcher in
the area of Leukemia at
Drexel University. We pray
for your soul.

David sits amongst the mourners in the standing room only church. His eyes drift
to a woman two rows ahead of him. She's turned around, looking at him. Her eyes
are red  from crying.

David looks away. His eyes stop on an old man far to his left just a few seats
away. Father, mother and daughter stare silently.

David surveys the entire church... Desperate inconsolable eyes question his
existence from every direction.

David has to look down.

PRIEST
...Jennifer Pennyman, third
grade teacher at Jefferson
Elementary.
(beat)
We pray for your soul.

CUT TO:

INT. BACK OF CHURCH - AFTERNOON

David and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation
room. The priest looks in his fifties, eyes tired, blood shot.

DAVID
I used to play football in
college. In my first year as
quarterback, we went on this
winning streak. It just went
on and on. It didn't matter
who we played... I'd always
win.
(beat)
You get superstitious when
something like that happens.
You give things meaning.
Like you wear the same color
socks each game or you
listen to the same B.B. King
song before you leave the
apartment. I wouldn't even
untie the shoelaces on my
cleats. I'd just slip them
on and off so nothing would
change... I gave things
meaning that had no meaning.
(beat)
I'm here to make sure I'm
not making shoelaces into
something they're not again.
(beat)
I was the only person to
survive that accident. The
only one... It feels like it
means something.

Beat.

PRIEST
Are you a religious man,
David?

David nods, ""No.""

The priest removes the sacred stoll from his around his neck and kisses it before
folding it carefully.

PRIEST
Good. Because I'm going to
talk to you as a man. Not as
a man of the cloth.

DAVID
Okay.

Beat. The priest turns to David.

PRIEST
It was luck.

Beat.

DAVID
What do you mean?

PRIEST
Luck... Random... Without
meaning.

David just sits awkwardly.

PRIEST
Three years ago, my cousin
died on a plane that crashed
on take off at Philadelphia
International airport. Do
you remember that crash?

David nods, ""Yes.""

PRIEST
I prayed and prayed and
finally found some meaning
in the event. It gave me
peace... And then not quite
a year later, an entire
family from my parish burned
to death in a hotel fire
downtown...
(beat)
Again I prayed. Again I
found  meaning.
(beat)
Just two days ago, my nephew
rode with you on that train
back from New York. He was
traveling alone for the
first time.

PRIEST
I'm sorry if I can't react
to your survival with the
appropriate 'It was the hand
of God. It was a miracle.'
kind of answer... I'm fresh
out of those right now.

David is shaken. Beat.

DAVID(soft)
The metal of the watch I was
wearing was crushed like a
sledge hammer hit it.

Beat. The priest's eyes fill with emotion.

PRIEST
My twelve year old nephew's
neck was broken in four
places... What's your point?
You were chosen?
(beat)
I don't think so.

The priest turns and continues putting away artifacts from the mass. Silence
fills the back room.

CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

No cameras greet his exit. No people anywhere.

David walks across the now empty parking lot. His car is the only one left.

He walks to the driver's side. Pulls out his keys. That's as far as he gets.

His eyes catch sight of the GRAY ENVELOPE tucked under the windshield wiper of
his car.

David moves forward and gently pulls it out. His name is typed on the front. He
turns it over. Two embossed words on the back.

""Limited Edition""

He opens the envelope. One line, handwritten, gazes at him from the gray index
card.

The line reads...

""How many days of your life have you been sick?""

Nothing else is written.

David Dunne looks around the empty parking lot quietly.

CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

A poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A
bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels
on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone.

David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They
all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on
all their backs...

""Stadium Security""

This ritual goes on without a word.

CUT TO:

INT. MAIN STADIUM CORRIDOR - MORNING

David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As
he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty
sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside.

David stops at a door marked ""PERSONNEL"".

CUT TO:

INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - MORNING

David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the
personnel office.

The SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and
never looks up as she talks.

ANCIENT SECRETARY
Yes?

DAVID
Is Noel in?

ANCIENT SECRETARY
No sir he is not.
(beat)
I read about you in the
paper.

DAVID
Oh.

ANCIENT SECRETARY
I was in an accident once
too. A horse almost trampled
me to death.

DAVID
Wow.

ANCIENT SECRETARY
I had to put him down.

Beat.

DAVID
That's a sad story.
(beat)
Do you think you could ask
Noel something for me?

The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it
over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up.

ANCIENT SECRETARY
Proceed.

DAVID
Ask if he can check how many
sick days I've taken since
I've worked here?

Beat.

ANCIENT SECRETARY
Is that the entire message?

DAVID
Yes.

CUT TO:

EXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON

Rain falls in sheets in the stadium.

David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He
stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches
the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely
see David's face under the hood.

There is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem
unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on
the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched
behind them declares, ""The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships.""

David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of
activity on the sidelines. Beat.

David steps out into the rain.

CUT TO:

EXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON

A handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's
rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence.

David and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight
circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just
stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat.

DAVID
You know what I think about
to calm down? I think about
those big fat, hundred and
twenty pound turtles that
live in the islands. Those
suckers never get angry,
never get in fights and live
longer than all of us and
all they do all is sit on
the beach and hump other
turtles.
(beat)
Why don't we take a second
and think about the turtles?

Nobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment.

FATHER
Yeah Jerry why don't you
think about the fat ass
turtles... Like your fat ass
son on the field
jeopardizing the rest of our
chances at a fucking
championship.

David tenses. Everyone looks to JERRY. A bald man who stands just a foot away.
Jerry nods to himself. Looks like he's going to say something. Instead he lunges
forward and smashes a HEADBUTT to the man who spoke to him.

David tackles Jerry hard and fast. He drives him into the ground.

Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt.

The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other. The remaining security
guard calls on his walkie for assistance.

David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the
man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field.

David's eyes are not on Jerry. They gaze out onto the field where twenty two
elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off,
rain washing over their faces. They watch in horror as their parents attack each
other on the sidelines.

CUT TO:

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

David is the last one left. He's showered and back in his street clothes. He sits
in the dimly lit room on the bench, lost in his thoughts when the door opens.

He turns to find a somewhat pregnant looking man with a tie step in. This is
NOEL.

DAVID
Hey Noel.

Beat. He just stares.

NOEL
Forty dollars.

David turns on the bench.

DAVID
What?

NOEL
You're getting a forty
dollar raise per week...
that's it.

Silence.

NOEL
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick
day.
(beat)
Five years, no sick days. I
get it. You want a raise.
You made your point.

The room is still. Beat.

NOEL
All right fifty dollars and
that's the god damn limit.
(beat)
Are we done here?

Beat. David nods, ""Yes.""

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

LIGHTS OUT.

David is wide awake in his bed. He glances over. Jeremy is in deep sleep next to
him.

CUT TO:

INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

David knocks again quietly. The guest bedroom door opens.

Megan looks up at David. She's just woken up.

MEGAN(low voice)
Is Jeremy okay?

DAVID(low voice)
He's asleep.

MEGAN(low voice)
Oh.

Beat. They both stand awkwardly for a moment.

DAVID(low voice)
I wanted to ask you a
question. It'll sound
strange, but just think
about it for a second.

Megan nods, ""Yes.""

DAVID(low voice)
When's the last time I was
sick? You remember?

Megan tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question. Beat.

MEGAN(low voice)
I don't know. It's been a
while.

DAVID(low voice)
I haven't been sick this
year. I know that.

MEGAN(low voice)
Okay.

DAVID(low voice)
Do you remember me getting
sick?

MEGAN(low voice)
Not a specific day. What's
this about?

DAVID (low voice)
Megan, do you ever remember
me getting sick?

Beat.

DAVID(low voice)
In the three years we've
been in this house?... In
the old apartment?... Before
Jeremy was born?... Before
we were married?

Beat.

MEGAN(low voice)
...I can't remember.

DAVID(low voice)
That's strange isn't it? Not
remembering one fever... Or
a cold... Or a sore throat.
What do you think that
means?

MEGAN(low voice)
It means we're probably to
tired to remember.

David becomes quiet as he thinks. Beat.

MEGAN(low voice)
Is that what you wanted to
ask me?

DAVID(low voice)
Yes.

MEGAN(low voice)
Is there anything else you
wanted to ask me while I'm
up?...

MEGAN(low voice)
...When was the last time
you wore pink? When was the
last time you drank soup
standing up? Final call for
strange questions at two in
the morning.

DAVID(low voice)
No that's it.

David seems lost in his thoughts.

MEGAN(low voice)
Maybe you should go up.
Jeremy might see you're gone
and get frightened.
(beat)
The train thing, really
shook him up. He's scared
something's going to happen
to you. He doesn't want to
let you out of his sight.

David stares at Megan. Beat.

DAVID(low voice)
Yeah. I know.

There's silence for a bit.

DAVID(low voice)
When was the last time I
wore pink?

MEGAN(low voice)
The Mitchell barbecue three
years ago.

DAVID(realizing)
Oh shit...

MEGAN(low voice)
Matching shirt and shorts.
It was brutal.

David half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room.

DAVID(low voice)
Goodnight Megan.

Megan looks back at her husband. Just for a moment. Then she looks down.

MEGAN(low voice)
Goodnight David.

Megan closes the door slowly shut.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

WE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom.

LEGEND ""1974""

A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a
small black and white television in the corner of the room.

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a
moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off.

The room GOES SILENT.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
No more sitting in this
room. I've let it go on long
enough.

ELIJAH
I'm not going out anymore.
I'm not getting hurt again.
This was the last time. I
told you.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
You can't do anything about
that. You might fall between
that chair and this
television. If that's what
God has planned for you,
that's what's going to
happen. You can't hide from
it in your room.

Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen.

ELIJAH
They call me Mr. Glass at
school. Cause I break like
glass.

Elijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat.

Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
...You make this decision
now to be afraid...
(beat)
And you'll never turn back
your whole life. You'll
always be afraid.

Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her
face. Neither says anything for a while. Beat.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
...I got a present for you.

ELIJAH
Why?

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
Forget why. Do you want it
or not?

Elijah thinks it over. He nods, ""Yes.""

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
Well, go get it then.

ELIJAH
Where is it?

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
On a bench, across the
street.

Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
You calling me a liar?

She points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in
the room.

The view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the
street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it.

There are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN
PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it.

Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window.

ELIJAH
Someone's gonna take it.

Beat.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
Then you better get out
there soon.

CUT TO:

EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

Elijah walks across the playground. He's very wary of the other children running
about him.

He walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package
on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs.

He undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper
together. He unfolds the paper. Beat.

Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap.

He feels the shadow of his mother. She takes a seat next to him.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
I bought a whole bunch.
They'll be one of these
waiting for you, every time
you want to come out here.

Beat.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
They said this one has a
surprise ending.

Elijah looks to his mother. His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a
moment.

He looks back down at his lap. He opens the first page...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STORE - DAY

The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown
into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick.

He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are
depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is
extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal.

MAN
This is from Fritz
Champion's own library. This
is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the
stands in 1968.

Elijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the
sketch.

ELIJAH
It's a classic depiction of
good versus evil. Notice the
square jaw of Slayer -
common in most comic book
heroes. And the slightly
disproportionate size of
Jaguaro's body to his head.
This again is common, but
only in villains... The
thing to notice about this
piece... The thing that
makes it very, very
special... is its realistic
depiction of its figures.
When the characters
eventually made it into the
magazine they were
exaggerated... as always
happens.
(beat)
This is vintage.

The business man rubs his face. Gazes at the sketch. Beat.

BUSINESS MAN
Wrap it up.

ELIJAH
You've made a considerably
wise decision.

Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art
gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.

BUSINESS MAN
My kid's gonna go berserk.

Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns.

ELIJAH
Once again please?

BUSINESS MAN
My son Jeb. It's a gift for
him.

ELIJAH
How old is Jeb?

BUSINESS MAN
Four.

ELIJAH
No.

Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly.

ELIJAH
No, no, no, no no... You
need to go now.

BUSINESS MAN
What did I say?

ELIJAH
Do you see any Telletubbies
around here?... Do you see
a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt with my
name printed on it?... Do
you see a little Asian child
with a blank expression
sitting outside in a
mechanical helicopter that
shakes when you put a
quarter in it?... No?...
Well that's what you see at
a toy store? Any you must
think this is a toy store,
cause you're in here
shopping for an infant named
Jeb. One of us has made a
gross error and wasted the
other person's valuable
time...

Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man.

ELIJAH
This is an art gallery my
friend. This is piece of
art...

Elijah points at the sketch.

ELIJAH
This is one of seventeen
original drawings by Fritz
Champion remaining in the
world. It's value will
triple every year... This
piece is to be treasured. To
be cherished... To be
coveted by every single one
of your banker friends that
think they're better than
you.

The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. Beat.

BUSINESS MAN
What if I kept it?

Beat.

ELIJAH
I'm listening.

BUSINESS MAN
I'll keep it in my office
room.

ELIJAH
What about Jeb?

BUSINESS MAN
I have a lock on the door.

Elijah just stares.

ELIJAH
Will it be near a window?

BUSINESSMAN
No direct sunlight will fall
on it.

Elijah eyes the man for many seconds. Beat.

ELIJAH
Come back in three days.
I'll think about it.

Elijah starts to the back. He passes the front door as two customers walk in.
Elijah talks over his shoulder to them.

ELIJAH
We're by appointment only.

MAN
I received a card from your
store.

ELIJAH
Congratulations, you have a
mailbox... The sale isn't
for two weeks.

MAN
This one was under the
windshield of my car.

Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. David Dunne stands with
Jeremy.

Elijah just stands staring for the longest time. Beat. He walks closer to them.
When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it.

ELIJAH
You've never been sick?

DAVID
I don't know for sure.
(beat)
...I don't think so.

David and Elijah quietly look at each other. Beat.

ELIJAH
Well if this ain't a riddle
worthy of the Riddler?

CUT TO:

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the
store. The words, ""Limited Edition"" are etched in the window.

David, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. Elijah's cane
is on his lap.

Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup.

ELIJAH
So let's get some of the
usual questions out of the
way. Why am I using a cane?
Raise your hand if you were
thinking that.

Jeremy raises his hand.

ELIJAH
I fractured my leg. It's the
fifth time I've done that
particular bone. It didn't
really heal well this time.

ELIJAH
Raise your hand is you're
wondering who the hell
breaks the same bone five
times?

Jeremy and David raise their hands.

ELIJAH
I have something called
Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
It's a genetic disorder. I
don't make this particular
type of protein very well
and it makes my bones very
low in density, very easy to
break. I've had fifty-four
breaks in my life. I have
the tamest version of the
disorder... Type one.
(beat)
There are type two, type
three, and type four. Type
four's don't make it very
long...
(beat)
That ends our lecture on the
medical anomaly known as
Elijah Price.

Elijah stares at his two rapt listeners.

ELIJAH
How certain are you that you
haven't been sick in your
life?

DAVID
Seventy-five percent.

ELIJAH
Seventy-five percent? That's
not nearly good enough for
me. I'm extremely skeptical.

DAVID
Skeptical about what?

ELIJAH
Your answer to my question.
It's one thing to have never
been injured in your life,
but to state that you've
never taken ill, well that's
a whole new level.

JEREMY
Dad's been injured.

Beat.

ELIJAH
What's he talking about?

DAVID
In college. A car accident.

ELIJAH
Was it serious?

David nods.

JEREMY
He couldn't play football
anymore.

Beat. Elijah looks shaken.

ELIJAH
I assumed because of the
train.

DAVID
You assumed wrong.

Elijah closes his eyes. When his eyes open, the life force in them has
diminished. Beat.

ELIJAH
It's over.
(beat)
You can go now.

Elijah uses his cane to get up and walk back through the doors of the store.

INT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy enter the store. Elijah leans on a walking stick before one of
the framed sketches. He gazes at it quietly.

DAVID
I think you skipped a couple
steps.

Elijah turns.

DAVID
You forgot the ""Now I'm
going to tell you what the
hell is going on"" step. See
usually that comes before
the, ""It's over"" Step. And
it always, always comes
before the ""You can go""
Step.
(beat)
What is over?

ELIJAH
The life of an idea that has
lived too long in my head.

David stares at Elijah impatiently.

ELIJAH
There are probably only four
or five individuals in the
world who can claim more
knowledge of comics than
myself. I've spent a third
of my life in a hospital bed
with nothing else to do but
read. I have studied the
form intimately. I have seen
the patterns in them... The
references to social and
cultural events and the
atmosphere that surrounded
them. I've come to believe
that comics are our last
link to the ancient way of
passing on history.

ELIJAH
The Egyptians drew pictures
on walls about battles, and
events. Countries all around
the world still pass on
knowledge through pictorial
forms.
(beat)
I believe that comics, just
at their core now... have a
truth. They are depicting
what someone, somewhere felt
or experienced. Then of
course that core got chewed
up in the commercial machine
and gets jazzed up, made
titillating - cartooned for
the sale rack.

Elijah gazes at David.

ELIJAH
This city has had its share
of disasters. Well
publicized ones. It was
around the time of that
plane crash, when it first
entered my head. And there
it stayed, as I waited and
watched the news over the
years...
(beat)
And then one day I see a
news report on a train
accident and its sole
survivor who was
miraculously unharmed.
(soft)
And just like that, an idea
blossoms into the flower of
possible reality.

DAVID
What was your idea Elijah?

Beat.

ELIJAH(soft)
If there is someone like me
in the world, and I'm at one
end of the spectrum...
Couldn't there be someone
the opposite of me, at the
other end?
(beat)
A person who can't be hurt
like the rest of us. A kind
of person they were talking
about in those stories.

Elijah points at the framed comic sketches.

ELIJAH(soft)
A person they believed was
put here to protect the rest
of us. Guard us.

JEREMY
You thought my dad was a
real-

DAVID
Jeremy don't take another
sip of that drink.

Jeremy looks down at the paper cup in his hands.

DAVID
Throw it in the trashcan
near the door and wait for
me outside. Do it now
please.

David waits for Jeremy to exit the store. Beat.

DAVID
At the church... You were
following me weren't you?

ELIJAH
Technically no. I gambled
that you would attend the
church service. I just
waited for you.

David glares at Elijah.

DAVID
What's this about? This is
obviously some scam. Is this
where you tell me one of
those pictures is like an
investment?

ELIJAH
You've misunderstood.

DAVID
I see guys like you all the
time in my work. You find
someone you think is
emotionally vulnerable and
you tell them a fantastic
story, utterly convincing...
and somewhere in there, you
slip it in... 'I just need
your credit card number','I
just need a small down
payment.'

David shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat.

DAVID
Did you know that this
morning was the first
morning I can remember, that
I didn't open my eyes and
feel that sadness... Do you
know what I'm talking about?
That little bit of sadness?
(beat)
I thought the person that
wrote that note had an
answer for me. For why I
survived that train. For why
my life feels so out of
balance...
(beat)
But I guess that's what you
were counting on.

Elijah stares carefully at David. Beat. David glances over to the entrance.
Jeremy watched through the window concerned.

DAVID
I'm going to leave now.
(beat)
Good luck with your sale.

Elijah watches David walk towards the front door.

ELIJAH
What type of job do you have
David?

David opens the door. He looks back at Elijah.

ELIJAH
You mentioned you've met
'guys like me' in your work.
(beat)
What type of job would that
be?

Beat.

DAVID
I work at the stadium as a
security guard.

Beat. David closes the door behind him. Elijah watches through the window as
Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street.

Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVID'S SIDE.

David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands.

Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs.

David doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently...

""TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD. 1 SURVIVOR""

Beat. David slides out from under his son's legs. Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake
up.

David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door.

A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the
narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T
FALL ON JEREMY.

There's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a
small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf.

His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a
handgun.

He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the
highest shelf.

He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE
SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD.

He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a
young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The
word ""Champion"" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings
- all are images and stories of David and football.

He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded
over three times, unlike the others. He opens it.

It's a newspaper headline. It reads...

""CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED""

David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the
font is similar.

David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and
heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb
seems to flicker. David is utterly still.

SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled.

He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it
back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.

ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door.

Megan stands in the darkened hall. Beat.

DAVID(whisper)
Hi.

Megan nods. Beat.

MEGAN(whisper)
I've come to a decision.

DAVID(whisper)
Oh.

Beat.

MEGAN(whisper)
Let me just ask you
something okay? And you can
be totally honest. I'm
prepared for any answer. It
won't affect me...

David nods, ""yes.""

MEGAN(whisper)
Have you been with anyone?
Since we started having
problems? The answer won't
affect me.

Beat. David stares at his wife.

MEGAN(whisper)
It won't affect me either
way.

Beat. David doesn't say anything. He just nods, ""No.""

Megan's face starts to tremble. She starts crying. Tears roll over her very
affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Beat.

MEGAN(soft)
...My decision is... I'd
like to start again. Pretend
we're at the beginning.
(beat)
It's a big deal you walked
away from that train. It's
a second chance.
(beat)
If you want to ask me out
sometime, that would be
okay.

Megan nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face. David watches her
disappear into the shadows.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  VETERAN'S STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Sunday afternoon. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky.
The Philadelphia Eagles pro football players are in uniform and doing stretches
on the field. The opposing team warms up on the other end of the field.

The sixty thousand seats are already half filled as fans stream in on every level
of the stadium.

CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are
ripping tickets.

David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards.

The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles
paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he
tilts his head sideways. ""We sleep with quarterbacks,"" is written in block
letters.

David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is
wearing an eagles uniform.

The WALKIE TALKIE on David's hip bursts to life. He pulls it off his hip an
listens.

WALKIE
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got
a guy at gate 17C with a
bogus ticket. Says he knows
you. He won't tell me his
name.

DAVID(into walkie)
What's he look like?

WALKIE
He's got the most beautiful
eyes... The hell kind of
question is that? He's a
guy.

DAVID(into walkie)
Send him packing. I'm not
walking all the way over
there.

WALKIE
Consider him packed. I
didn't like his attitude...
Struttin around with a cane
and shit.

Beat.

DAVID(into walkie)
Hold up Jenkins...

CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 17C - AFTERNOON

David finds Elijah waiting to the side as the crowds funnel through the gate.
Elijah offers his hand as he walks up. David doesn't take it.

ELIJAH
They said I couldn't get in
with my ticket.

Elijah offers him the ticket. David inspects it.

DAVID
It's for last week's game.

ELIJAH
I've come to understand
that...
(beat)
An ill advised purchase in
the parking lot.

David hands Elijah back the ticket.

DAVID
What do you want?

ELIJAH
Not money.
(beat)
But I appreciate your
healthy cynicism in the
manner. It will be wise for
both of us to proceed with
greatest caution.

DAVID
We're not proceeding
anywhere together.

ELIJAH
We've already begun.

David looks around.

DAVID
One more time. What is it
you want?

Beat.

ELIJAH
Why is it, do you think,
that of all the professions
in the world... you chose
protection?

DAVID
Are you for real?

ELIJAH
You could have poured coffee
in Starbucks, you could have
learned to install track
lighting in office
buildings, you could have
told people their horoscopes
on the internet... You could
have been one of ten
thousand things... but in
the end, you chose to
protect people. You made
that decision... and I find
that very, very interesting.
(beat)
Now all I need is your
credit card number.

Beat. Elijah smiles.

ELIJAH
That last part was a joke.

David fights it. But he smiles anyway. Beat.

DAVID
I got this job because my
college coach called the guy
who manages the stadium.
There's no hidden meaning to
it.

David's walkie makes NOIES on his hip.

DAVID
They need me at the gate.

David stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick.

DAVID
Did you really want to see
the game? I can get you in.

CUT TO:

EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

The line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity.

David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles.

DAVID
It gets heaviest ten minutes
before kickoff.

David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and
continues walking.

David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles.

DAVID
Why don't we pat down?

David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to
him.

DAVID
Just give me a minute.

ELIJAH
Is there a problem?

DAVID
That guy in green. Sometimes
people carry weapons in
here. Then they drink too
much. They're team isn't
doing so well, bad things
happen... We do random pat
downs of the crowd to
discourage people from
carrying.
(beat)
If he's carrying, he'll step
out of line.

Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through
the turnstiles.

The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he
watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile.

David eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten...

The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket
melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the
stadium.

CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in
causing long shadows.

Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself.

THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES FROM THE
FIELD INTO THE TUNNEL.

David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket.

DAVID
I got you a seat in the
seven hundred level.
(points straight up)
It's nose-bleed territory,
but at least you won't get
spit on.

ELIJAH
How did you know that man
you bumped was carrying a
weapon?

DAVID
Probably the army jacket.
Those guys carry hunting
knives and stuff for show.

ELIJAH
You thought he was carrying
a knife?

Beat.

DAVID
I thought he was carrying
something.

ELIJAH
But not a knife?

DAVID
I got this picture of a
silver handled gun tucked in
his pants.
(beat)
Like on t.v.

Elijah stares at David. THE STADIUM CHEERS BOUNCE OFF THE GRAY WALLS.

ELIJAH
You have good instincts when
it comes to things like
that?

DAVID
Like what?

ELIJAH
Telling when people have
done something wrong?

Beat.

DAVID
Yes.

ELIJAH
Have you ever tried to
develop it?

DAVID
I don't know what you're
asking?

ELIJAH
You're skill.

Beat.

DAVID
Listen. I got to be on the
sidelines during the game...
You can get to your seat by
taking the stairwell at-

ELIJAH
Characters in comic books
are often attributed special
powers. X-ray vision, things
of that sort.

David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah.

DAVID
Okay, I don't want to play
this game anymore.

ELIJAH
It's an exaggeration of the
truth. Maybe it's based on
something as simple as
instinct. Like being able to
touch someone and tell
whether they've done
something wrong... Or the
level of what they've done
wrong.

DAVID
The guy might not have been
carrying anything.

ELIJAH
Or he might have been
carrying a silver handled
gun tucked in his pants.

David's WALKIE ERUPTS WITH NOISE.

DAVID
I have to go now.

ELIJAH
One last question.

Beat.

DAVID
Quick.

ELIJAH
The car accident you were
in... Was there anyone else
involved?

The two men stand very still in the tunnel.

DAVID
Yes. My wife Megan. She was
in the car with me.

David turns and starts down the hall. David talks back over his shoulder.

DAVID
Have a good life Elijah and
try to buy your tickets at
an authorized sales
location.

Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of
the tunnel.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin
foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every
corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of
his car in the parking lot of the stadium. He sits as thoughts crash at his head.
Beat.

He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview
mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car.

Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out
of the parking lot.

Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine.

CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

Elijah's walking stick makes RHYTHMIC CLICKS on the concrete parking lot.

The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step.

Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the
hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his
pace through the lot.

He gains on the army jacket.

ELIJAH(calls out)
Hold up for a second!

The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the
end of the parking lot. He looks back at Elijah for a beat. Doesn't like what he
sees. He disappears into the subway entrance.

Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful.
He makes it with great strain to the subway.

He looks into the entrance...

A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket
is glimpsed before it disappears.

Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing.

ELIJAH(calls out)
I just want to ask you
something!

Elijah's VOICE ECHOES down the stairs. No response.

Elijah starts his descent.

THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS.

Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's
moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step.

His hand slips away from the railing...

He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is
heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall.

The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL
STAIRS.

He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway
landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF
THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN.

His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The
green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing
through the turnstile.

The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat
riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out
from the belt of his pants.

CUT TO:

EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK

David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus
pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his
security clothes. The bus pulls away as he hears his SON'S VOICE.

David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are
having a touch football game. Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to
David.

JEREMY
Was it sold out?

David nods, ""No.""

DAVID
You know how mad your mom
would be if she knew you
were playing football?

Jeremy nods.

JEREMY
Are you going to tell?

David nods, ""No.""

JEREMY
You want yo play the last
downs? We got a big guy like
you. You can play on
opposite sides.

David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who
stands with the other children.

JEREMY
He's Potter's cousin. He's
the starting corner back for
Temple University.

David stares at his son.

JEREMY
He going pro in the draft.
They say he can run the
fifty-

DAVID
In under six seconds.
(beat)
I've heard.

David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of
the kids feel his flexed bicep.

DAVID
I'm going to go in.

JEREMY
Just play one set of downs.
I told them you were great.

DAVID
Why'd you do that?

JEREMY
Just one-

DAVID
Jeremy.
(beat)
I'm going in. I have to do
some things.

JEREMY
What things?

DAVID
I'm going to work out.

JEREMY
I'll help you.

DAVID
There's nothing to do.

Jeremy turns back to the children and waves.

JEREMY(yells)
I can't play! I'm working
out with my dad!

Jeremy turns back to his father and takes his hand. David looks down at his son
who waits patiently.

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

The basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations. An old
bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner.

David sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and
places fifteen a pound weight on the bar. David talks over his shoulder.

DAVID
Why don't you rest now? I'll
take it from here. You've
been a big help.

Jeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to put on another weight.

JEREMY
You think you could beat up
Mike Tyson? I mean before he
started wiggin out and
eating people's ears?

DAVID
No.

JEREMY
What if you worked out
everyday for six months? You
think you could beat him
then?

DAVID
No.

JEREMY
What if you only ate foods
that were good for you and
you worked out everyday for
a year?

Jeremy is breathing hard as he puts the safety collars on the barbell and comes
around to David's end of the bench. David lays back.

DAVID
No.

David takes hold of the barbell. Beat. He takes a deep breath.

The weight comes off the armrests of the bench. David lowers it to his chest and
pushes it back up. He does just one more rep with serious strain. He puts the
weight back on the armrest and sits up.

DAVID
How much did you put on
there?

David twists around and looks back at the barbell. He counts up the black metal
circles. He turns back to Jeremy.

DAVID
You put too much. That's two
hundred and fifty pounds.

JEREMY
How much can you lift?

David looks back at the weights.

DAVID
That's the most I've ever
lifted.
(beat)
That could have been
dangerous Jeremy. Why don't
you go upstairs and let me
finish up?

Jeremy starts back to the barbell.

JEREMY
I'll take it off. I'll help
you right.

He slips off the safety collar.

JEREMY
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

David hears the SOUND OF THE WEIGHTS SLIDING OFF THE BAR BEHIND HIM.

DAVID
No.

JEREMY
I mean if you knew karate?

DAVID
No Jeremy.

JEREMY
What if he wasn't aloud to
kick and you were really mad
at him?

Jeremy is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around
to David.

David lays back.

DAVID
No.

David takes hold of the bar. Lifts it off the armrest. Brings it down. His arms
are straining hard again. He raises it and lowers it two time; it takes a sizable
effort. The weights bang down onto the armrest.

David sits up.

DAVID
How much did you take off?

JEREMY
I lied.

Beat.

DAVID
You added?

Jeremy nods, ""Yes"" slowly.

David turns completely around and looks at the barbell. He counts the black discs
on the steel bar. Beat.

Nobody says anything for a long time.

JEREMY(soft)
How much is it?

DAVID(soft)
Two hundred and seventy.

David just stares at the black steel circles on the metal bar. Jeremy comes and
sits on the bench next to his father. They both stare at the weight. Beat.

JEREMY(dead serious)
Let's put more.

Beat.

DAVID
Okay.

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

David's fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar. He leans his head forward
and looks to Jeremy.

DAVID
Why don't you move back a
bit? Just to be safe.

Jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house. He waits.

Another deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm
rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin
to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely
onto the rest.

David sits up. He looks at his son whose eyes are wide. Beat.

JEREMY
More?

Beat. David nods, ""Yes.""

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

An enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar. David's hands are gripping the
metal.

He talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without
looking at him.

DAVID
You should never try
anything like this. You know
that right?

Jeremy nods, ""Yes.""

DAVID
What do you do if something
happens?

JEREMY(soft)
Get mom.

David nods, ""yes"" before starting his deep breathing. He takes one last breath.
CLINK the weights comes off the rest. His arms are trembling immediately now. His
face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up
again two times before dropping it onto the armrest.

He slowly sits up.

DAVID
How many did you put on that
time?

JEREMY(soft)
All of it.

DAVID
There's no more left?

Jeremy nods, ""no"" in a slight daze. Beat. David looks around his basement.

DAVID
What else can we use?

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING

A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal
handles on the outside of each side of the weights.

The fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest. His arms
are shaking hard. He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. It
touches his chest and rises up again. David's red strained face exhales
powerfully as he straightens his arms.

The bar lands on the armrest with A CRASH. The paint cans make METAL SQUEAKS as
they swing to stillness, one at a time. Beat.

David sits up and turns back to the weights. His mouth moves as he calculates the
discs and the cans.

His lips stop moving. Beat.

JEREMY(soft)
How much is it?

David doesn't react.

JEREMY(soft)
How much is it dad?

It takes a second for David to register the question. He looks to his son. Beat.

DAVID(soft)
About three hundred and
forty.

David turns and looks at his son. Jeremy's mouth is slightly open. He gazes at
his dad. Awe in his tiny eyes.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

David sits on the edge of the bathroom tub. He's just showered and wearing jeans
and a t-shirt. He sits still with his elbows resting on his knees, staring at the
white tiles of the floor.

THE PHONE RINGS.

David gets up and walks out of the bathroom. He picks up the phone and stands in
the bathroom doorway.

DAVID
Yeah, hello.

WOMAN(on phone)
Is David Dunne there?

Beat.

DAVID
Megan?

MEGAN(on phone)
Yes. Is this David?

DAVID
Yeah? Megan where are you
calling from?

MEGAN(on phone)
My name is Megan Inverso. We
went to college together.

David looks at the phone. The lights for line ONE and line TWO are glowing RED.
David squints his eyes as he pieces together the situation. Beat.

He moves back into the bathroom. The cord stretches as he takes his seat on the
edge of the bathtub.

DAVID
I remember you.

MEGAN(on phone)
I was hoping you would call
me, but... Anyway I decided
not to wait.
(beat)
I was thinking, it might be
nice to go to dinner
together.

Beat.

MEGAN(soft)
...Hello?

Beat.

DAVID
Yeah it might be nice.

We hear A SOUND ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE. A SOUND MUCH LIKE AN EXHALE.

CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LATE EVENING

The local Chinese restaurant. Red and gold plastic dragons hang from the ceiling.
A couple late-nighters are at the bar. Megan and David are two of a handful of
people left dining in the restaurant. They're a little dressed up. Megan looks
kind of stunning.

DAVID
...When you work with
clients on machines, do they
sometimes just jump up a
level or two? Do something
they didn't know they were
capable of?

MEGAN
Not often, but it is
possible. Most people get
scared when they see the
shadow of their limits. They
don't know how long the
shadow really is. They don't
know how far away the real
limits are standing... They
stop out of fear.

David nods as he takes it in. Beat. He looks down at his plate and twirls his lo
mein onto a fork. Megan watches him.

MEGAN
This is kind of strange
isn't it?

David nods, ""yes"" before taking the bite.

MEGAN
We're not even acting like
ourselves.

David touches his mouth with his napkin.

MEGAN
Like that. Your mouth's
dirty. You tapped your
napkin to your lips. You
only do that when you're
with someone you don't know.

David looks down at his napkin.

DAVID
What do I do when I'm around
someone I know?

MEGAN
You use your sleeve.

They both smile at each other. Beat.

WOMAN(o.s.)
Megan?

David and Megan look over to the only other table of late night diners as they
get up from their table. A woman about Megan's age walks over to her.

WOMAN
I thought it was you.

MEGAN
Hi.
(to David)
This is Claire. Her son is
in Jeremy's class. Claire
and I worked on the school
food drive together.

DAVID
Hello.

CLAIRE smiles as she stares at David. She turns to Megan.

CLAIRE(mouths)
He's cute.

Claire turns back to David.

CLAIRE
I'm very happy about this.
Megan mentioned to me she
was considering dating
again.

Megan becomes still.

CLAIRE(to David)
I'm sorry, what's your name?

Beat. David doesn't look up.

DAVID
David.

CLAIRE
David?

MEGAN
This is my husband.

Beat. All three people become frozen in silence.

Claire looks to Megan.

CLAIRE(soft)
I am so sorry.

Megan nods.

Claire quietly walks away form the table and joins her group as they leave the
restaurant. Beat.

Megan and David are the last one's left. They sit silently in their booth. Megan
looks at David's face. He's shaken.

He slowly takes a sip of water and then taps his mouth with napkin.

CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

It's late. NO LIGHTS ARE ON EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE HALL. The babysitter has black
dyes hair and Buddy Holly glasses. David waits as she puts on her jacket.

DYED HAIR GIRL
He ate about six of those
chocolate covered doughnut
holes with his milk. He said
he only had three, but I
know he had six.

DAVID
Okay.

David is not paying attention to the girl. He watches as his wife takes off her
coat and heads to the guest room. She turns before entering the room. David and
his wife make eye contact.

MEGAN(soft)
Goodnight.

David nods. Megan goes into her room. The guest door closes softly.

David finds the babysitter looking at him with an odd expression.

DYED HAIR GIRL
My parents sleep in separate
beds.

David reaches into his wallet and hands the girl money.

DAVID
Thank you.

David opens the front door for her.

DYED HAIR GIRL
By the way, Jeremy went to
sleep in his room tonight.

DAVID
His room?

The baby sitter nods with a smile as she walks out the front door.

CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM

David walks into the darkened child's bedroom. The lump on the bed turns when he
hears movement. He smiles when he sees David.

JEREMY(whispered)
I'm sleeping in my room.

DAVID(soft)
I see.

JEREMY(whispered)
I'm not scared.

DAVID(soft)
That's great.

JEREMY(whispered)
Do you know why?

David nods, ""No.""

JEREMY(whispered)
I know now.

DAVID(soft)
Know what?

JEREMY(whispered)
You're secret identity.
(beat)
That man was right.

Beat. David just stares at his son. Jeremy's eyes start to close.

DAVID
Jeremy.

Jeremy opens his eyes.

DAVID(soft)
There are big guys in almost
every gym who can lift that
much.

Beat. Jeremy's eyes start to shut.

JEREMY(whispered)
You could have lifted more.
(his eyes close)
...Don't worry, I won't tell
anyone.

Jeremy Dunne falls asleep. David Dunne stands in the darkness of his son's room.
Posters of comic book heroes don the walls around him.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Elijah's cheek rests against two pristine white pillows. He looks exhausted. His
eyes are fixed on some abstract point in the room. WE HEAR SOUNDS OF A HOSPITAL.

The torso of a PHYSICIAN can be seen on the other side of the bed. We hear him
speak but never see his face.

PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
...fracture of the proximal
phalanx of the little finger
as well as multiple
fractures of the sixth,
seventh, and eighth ribs.
The worst of the injury,
however, was sustained to
the left leg in the form of
a spiral fracture. There
were fourteen breaks. It
simply shattered...

ELIJAH
They call me Mr. Glass.

Beat.

PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
Who does?

ELIJAH
Kids.

Elijah just keeps staring.

PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
Shall I continue?

Beat. Elijah's head nods the slightest bit up and down.

PHYSICIAN(o.s.)
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg. The
use of a wheelchair will be
needed for a two month
period. The use of crutches
will follow for twelve to
fourteen months. Hospital
stay will range from five to
eight days followed by nine
to twelve months of physical
therapy. Prescribed
medication for pain
management will take the
usual forms of...

The PHYSICIAN'S WORDS FADE AWAY as Elijah continues to gaze at an abstract point
in the room.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE MORNING

WE EMERGE FROM DARKNESS TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER.

A CO-WORKER finds Megan working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a
stationary bike.

JANIS
Your ten o'clock is here.
The hospital discharged him
this morning.

MEGAN
Thanks.

The co-worker takes Megan's position by the elderly man.

Megan crosses the physical therapy center. A man in a wheel chair waits by her
office. She walks up to him with a smile.

MEGAN
Elijah right?

Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight. Under his shirt
we see the wrappings around his ribs. His left pinky is in a splint. He smiles
and nods, ""yes"" to Megan.

CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

David Dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into
the players locker room.

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room
has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment.

About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost
in their own pre-game rituals.

David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and
removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down,
wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him.

David just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat.

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it.

He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of
the large room not occupied by anyone.

David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of
free weights sit behind the press.

David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either
side. Six in all.

David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing.
Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the
players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell
phones...

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off
the weight rack.

The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND...

A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side...

And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side...

THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat.

No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench.

David's hands take hold of the shiny bar.

He closes his eyes...

David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move.

His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps
training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing.

And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest.

The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His
arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up.

He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the
smallest of CLINKS.

David's fingers uncurl from the bar.

David lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs.

DAVID(whispers)
Four ten... four
forty-five...
(beat)
Five hundred.

Beat. David sits up in a daze.

He finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him. Some of the
players have stood up. Everyone stares as David Dunne with the same quiet
disbelief in their eyes.

CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - AFTERNOON

Megan and Elijah are in the far corner of the room. They're separated from the
other clients. Megan is seated on an exercise machine. Elijah is in his wheel
chair facing her.

MEGAN
We're going to prevent any
substantial atrophy of your
good leg with this.
(She taps the machine)
It works the quadriceps.

ELIJAH
How long have you been
married?

Megan is taken off guard by the question. She stares at Elijah. Beat.

MEGAN
Twelve years.

ELIJAH
How did you get together?

Elijah smiles warmly. Megan smiles softly back.

MEGAN
A car accident.

Elijah smiles even bigger.

ELIJAH
Now you're going to have to
tell me more.

MEGAN
...See my husband was a big
football star in college and
we were in an accident
together. Our car flipped on
an icy road. We were both
injured. He couldn't play
football anymore.
(beat)
If that hadn't happened, we
wouldn't have been together.

ELIJAH
How so?

MEGAN
Football wasn't the kind of
life I wanted... For ten
years I'd be by the phone
waiting for a call telling
me he broke his neck in a
practice game. And if it
wasn't that call, it would
be a call telling me he blew
out his knee or suffered his
third concussion. I've seen
way too much of it in my
job... I can barely take it
when my clients are in pain.
(beat)
I don't hate the game. I
admire the amount of skill
it involved and, like
everyone else, I was in awe
of how he could play it, but
I couldn't give him my heart
and then have something
happen to him. And it always
does with that game.
(beat)
It's not a thing many people
would understand.

ELIJAH
You and my mother would have
a special connection.

MEGAN
Any way, fate stepped in and
took football out of the
equation.

ELIJAH
...And everyone lived
happily ever after.

Beat.

MEGAN
Sort of.

Beat.

ELIJAH
What part of David's body
was injured?

Beat. Megan's eyes become utterly still.

MEGAN
Who said my husband's name
is David?

CUT TO:

INT. STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Eleven football players in white and green battle eleven football players in blue
and gray on the field. A sold out stadium watches the event.

David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the
second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the
bathrooms and concession stands and back again.

David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against
the wall. He looks over at the constant movement of spectators through the
tunnel.

Beat. His shoulder leaves the wall. He STEPS OUT into the stream of people.
Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move.

David's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening.

He continues into the dead center of the tunnel. He's in the heaviest part of the
movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass.

And then it happens... A stocky woman bumps into him.

FLASH CUT: AN IMAGE OF THE STOCKY WOMAN IN A BATHROBE STANDING IN A KITCHEN.
SHE'S HOLDING THE SHOULDER OF A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY STANDING NEXT TO HER. HE'S
CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY.

THEY BOTH ARE LOOKING DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WHERE THREE THINGS ARE LAID
OUT... A BELT, A HANGER, AND AN EXTENSION CORD.

STOCKY WOMAN
Choose.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

We're back with David in the crowd. He turns and watches the stocky woman walk
down the tunnel. She's holding the wrist of her five year old son. She yanks it
quickly and violently to keep the boy close at her side. She and the boy dissolve
into the crowd.

CUT TO:

INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - AFTERNOON

Elijah and Megan sit very still.

ELIJAH
There have been three major
disasters in this city over
the last four years. I've
followed each one of them...
A Seven-three-seven crashes
on take off. One hundred and
seventy-two die. No
survivors... A hotel fire
downtown. Two hundred and
eleven die. No survivors...
And am Amtrak train derails
seven and half miles outside
of the city. One hundred and
thirty one die. One
survivor. He is unharmed.
(beat)
I've spoken with your
husband about his survival.
I suggested a rather
unbelievable explanation.
Since then, I've come to
believe, that my
explanation, however
unbelievable, is in fact,
true.

MEGAN
And what was that
explanation?

Beat.

ELIJAH
It's a mediocre time Mrs.
Dunne. People are starting
to lose hope. It's hard for
many to believe that
extraordinary things live
inside themselves as well as
others... I hope you can
keep an open mind?

Beat.

MEGAN(soft)
Is this a religious thing?

ELIJAH
I own a comic book museum.
It's called the Limited
Edition.

MEGAN(smiles)
For a second there I thought
you were a fanatic.

ELIJAH
I believe comic books are
based loosely on reality -
I believe there are real
life equivalents of the
heroes in those books that
walk the earth - I believe
your husband is one of those
individuals.

Beat. Megan becomes utterly still.

ELIJAH
I'm glad you brought up fate
Mrs. Dunne. I'm becoming a
strong believer in it...
See, David refuses to speak
with me any longer... And

We were meant to speak to
each other.

INT. STADIUM - AFTERNOON

David lets the waves of people move by him in the tunnel.

A MAN WITH GRAY EYES and wearing a dark blue sweat shirt carries a cardboard tray
of nachos and drinks. He brushes David's arm as he passes.

FLASH CUT: THE IMAGE OF THE GREY EYED MAN WEARING A BLOOD SPLATTERED T-SHIRT IN
A MEN'S BATHROOM. HE'S VIOLENTLY KICKING ANOTHER MAN CURLED UP ON THE FLOOR OF A
TOILET STALL.

HE STOPS KICKING. HE GLARES DOWN WITH POWERFUL GRAY EYES.

SWEAT SHIRT MAN(whispers)
This is my house, bitch.
These are my customers.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

The gray eyes man in the blue sweat shirt pauses with nachos in hand at the top
of the stairs to locate his seats. Beat.

David walks the five feet between them and taps him on the shoulder. People
continue to stream by as the man turns to face David. The man's GRAY EYES go from
David's face to the security emblem on his shirt. The man's face becomes still.

GRAY EYED MAN
Yeah?

David stares hard at the man in front of him.

DAVID
We've had some problems with
drug selling in this
stadium.
(beat)
Would you mind if I checked
the pockets of your
sweatshirt?

The gray eyed man stands eerily still with his nachos and drinks. The two men
just stare at each other, evaluating the situation. People move in both
directions around them, unaware.

The gray eyes man holds his tray of food to the side and raises his arms slowly.

David steps forward and reaches into his pockets. Beat. David pulls his hands out
from the pockets. They're empty.

The gray eyes man brings his arms down. Beat.

The walkie on David's hip COMES TO LIFE. David reaches down and pulls it off his
belt without removing his eyes from the man in front of him. David brings the
walkie to his mouth.

DAVID(into walkie)
Yeah?

WALKIE(o.s.)
There's a message for you at
the office. Your kid was
hurt.

David's face changes.

DAVID(into walkie)
When?

WALKIE(o.s.)
Just now. They want you to
come down to his school.

David lowers the walkie from his face. The gray eyed man has a slight smile on.
Beat.

GRAY EYED MAN
Why don't you go take care
of your business?

The gray eyed man takes a bite of a nacho as he stares at David.

GRAY EYED MAN
And dude, no one carries
their merchandise on them
any more. They got
messengers for that shit
now.
(beat)
That's what they tell me.

The gray eyed man in the blue sweat shirt turns and starts down the stairs to his
seat. He raises his fist in the air as someone scores a touchdown on the field.

CUT TO:

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NURSE'S RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON

Jeremy is seated in a chair with abrasions and cuts on his face. He sits next to
a smaller boy with a thermometer in his mouth.

They're both looking at the glass window of the nurse's private office. There are
tow people inside talking. David and A WHITE HAIRED NURSE.

The THERMOMETER BOY pulls the thermometer out of his mouth.

THERMOMETER BOY
Is that your dad?

Jeremy nods ""Yes.""

THERMOMETER BOY
I bet my dad can beat up you
dad.

Jeremy turns to the thermometer boy.

JEREMY
I don't think so.

CUT TO:

INT. NURSE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

NURSE
...No, he insisted we only
call you.
(beat)
Though it took us a while to
track down your number. It's
not on file here.

DAVID
Megan handles that type of
stuff.

NURSE
What stuff is that?

DAVID
Jeremy's stuff.

David feels uncomfortable as the nurse just stares at him. Beat. David rises from
his seat.

DAVID
So do I need to put any
smelly ointments on him or
anything?

The white haired nurse nods, ""no.""

NURSE
It's more emotional damage.
It wasn't very serious
physically.

David nods.

NURSE
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

David stares at the white haired nurse.

DAVID
What was that?

NURSE
My office was on the other
side of the building back
then.
(beat)
You don't remember me do
you?

David nods, ""no.""

NURSE
I had red hair.

David stares at the woman. He doesn't recognize her.

NURSE
I think you were a little
younger than Jeremy when it
happened.
(beat)
Did you know we changed the
conduct rules of the pool
because of you?

David nods, ""no"" slowly.

NURSE
The kids still talk about it
like some ghost story...""Did
you know there was a kid
that almost drowned in the
pool? He got pneumonia and
almost died.""

The nurse shakes her head.

NURSE
We let them tell it... It
helps keep them safe.

Beat.

NURSE
Are you still phobic of
water?

David seems lost in his thoughts. He looks up at the nurse.

DAVID
Yes I am.

CUT TO:

EXT. BUS STOP - AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy are seated on a bench at a Septa bus stop. No one else is
waiting with them.

Jeremy talks without making eye contact with his dad.

JEREMY(soft)
It was Potter and another
guy I play football with.
They were messing with this
Chinese girl. She's kind of
fat. She doesn't talk to
anybody.
(beat)
I tried to make them stop.
They kept pushing me down
and wouldn't let me get up.

Beat. Jeremy's VOICE STARTS TO TREMBLE SOFTLY.

JEREMY(soft)
I thought maybe cause you
were my dad, I thought I
might be like you.

Jeremy finally looks up. Tears in his eyes.

JEREMY(soft)
I'm not like you.

David moves closer to Jeremy on the bench.

DAVID
You are like me. We both can
get hurt. I'm just an
ordinary man.
(beat)
I'm not what you think I am.

Jeremy just stares at his father. Beat.

JEREMY
Why do you keep saying that?

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

David stares at his bowl of pasta. He sits alone in the kitchen. Beat.

He gets up, slides the pasta in the trash and moves to the sink.

David is rinsing out the bowl when Megan walks in. David turns off the water.

MEGAN
He's just laying in bed.
He's pretty upset. He won't
talk.

DAVID
He's dealing with a lot of
things.
(beat)
I think he needs to find
answers himself.

Beat.

MEGAN
It's weird to hear you tell
me about Jeremy.
(beat)
A good weird.

David looks at Megan. They stand silently in an awkward pause. Beat.

DAVID
Would you like to try going-

MEGAN
Yes.

DAVID
-out again.

Beat. David smiles.

DAVID
But if we see another mother
from Jeremy's school, me
name is Juan. I always
wanted to be a Juan.

Megan smiles softly back. Beat.

MEGAN
Oh. Elijah Price came to
visit me at the center
today.

DAVID
Jesus.

Megan sees David's shocked expression.

MEGAN
He didn't do anything. He
just told me his theory...
It's sad when patients get
like that. They loose
reality.

DAVID(whisper)
Jeremy what the hell are you
doing?

Megan suddenly realizes David is looking over her shoulder.

Megan turns around. She SCREAMS.

Jeremy is standing in the doorway to the kitchen. He's crying hard. In his
outstretched hands is the HAND GUN FROM DAVID'S CLOSET. It's pointed directly at
David.

JEREMY(crying)
You don't believe. I'll show
you... You can't get hurt.

MEGAN(realizing)
-Oh my God.

DAVID
-Jeremy did you load that
gun?

Jeremy nods, ""Yes."" Crying harder now.

JEREMY(crying)
-You won't get hurt...

DAVID
-Elijah was wrong.

MEGAN
-Sometimes when people are
sick or hurt for a long
time, like Elijah, they're
mind gets hurt too.

David shoots a tense glance at Megan.

MEGAN
-They start to think things
that aren't true. He hold me
what he thought about your
father. It isn't true.

JEREMY(crying)
-I'll show you.

David starts moving a little to his right. Jeremy follows him with the barrel of
the handgun. David stops moving.

DAVID
-You know the story about
the kid who almost drowned
in the pool?

Jeremy stops moving.

DAVID
-That was me they were
talking about. I almost
died. That was me.

JEREMY(crying)
-You're lying.

DAVID
-I'm not. I just didn't
connect it.

MEGAN
-Jeremy, your father was
injured in college - you
know that. You know all
about that.

Jeremy's small face tenses. Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face.

MEGAN
-Don't do it. He'll die
Jeremy.

Beat. Jeremy looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks.

JEREMY(crying)
-I'll just shoot him once.

DAVID
-Jeremy listen to what-

Jeremy starts pressing the trigger. The hammer clicks back.

JEREMY
-Don't be scared.

DAVID
-Jeremy if you pull that
trigger I'm going to leave!
I'm going to go to New York.

Jeremy freezes. David flashes a desperate glance at Megan then back to Jeremy.

DAVID
You're right... If you shoot
me, that bullet is going to
bounce off me and I won't
get hurt... but then I'm
going to go upstairs and
pack. And then leave to New
York.

Beat.

JEREMY(crying)
-Why?

Jeremy's hands are trembling. He starts to close his eyes as he raises the gun
level with David's chest.

DAVID(loud)
Jeremy!

Jeremy's eyes open.

DAVID(loud)
You're about to get into big
trouble! I'm your father and
I'm telling you to put that
gun down right now God damn
it!
(beat)
One!...
(beat)
Two!...

Jeremy puts the gun down on the floor in front of him and stands up.

Megan leans against the refrigerator and slides down to a sitting position on the
tiled floor.

David walks over and picks up the gun. He unloads the bullets in his hand. David
bends down very slowly and takes a seat on the kitchen floor.

Jeremy is the last to sit down. He takes a seat in the doorway of the kitchen.
Beat. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. Beat.

JEREMY(soft)
...You didn't have to yell.

The Dunne family sits in silence on the floor of their kitchen.

CUT TO:

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON

People move up and down the streets outside the storefronts. David is one of
them. He waits to cross the street. He sees movement inside the Limited Edition
window.

CUT TO:

INT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON

Elijah opens the door. It takes him a bit, because of the wheelchair.

David stares at Elijah's damaged condition. Beat.

ELIJAH
Joined a rugby league.
Turned out to be a bad idea.
(beat)
Come here I want to show you
something.

Elijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall. It's a charcoal
drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be delivered.
A huge ominous shadow is covering him, as if something unspeakable and evil is
just out of frame.

ELIJAH
Look at this. I just noticed
this today.

David steps in close and studies the drawing.

ELIJAH
This is from the Sentryman
series. A color version of
this was actually used in
the second issue.

Elijah points up to the drawing's face.

ELIJAH
Look at this eyes. What do
you see?

David looks right at the intense eyes of the drawing.

ELIJAH
It's fear.
(beat)
He was scared. They were
being honest in the
beginning you see. They let
him be human.
(beat)
They turned him into a
garden variety hero later...
Then he was brave all the
time.

Elijah turns to David.

ELIJAH
I followed the guy in the
army jacket.

David becomes still as his words register.

ELIJAH
He had a silver handled gun
tucked in the back of his
pants.
(beat)
Were you really injured in
that car accident in
college?

David looks unsteady all of the sudden.

ELIJAH
Because I think you faked
it. I think you took the
opportunity to end your
career - no questions asked.
(beat)
And I think you did it, of
all things, for a women...
(beat)
Not only do you have the
physical traits of a hero,
down somewhere in there, you
have the moral code of one
too. You were ready to
sacrifice everything for
what's right. Where can you
find that these days?
(beat)
Only thing you didn't realize
is that you were giving up
a part of yourself when you
gave up football. The
physical part. And you need
that part desperately to
feel balance again...
(beat)
You can have it back now.
(beat)
This was all just make
believe before. What if
there was someone the
opposite of me? What if?...
(beat)
I now believe you are the
genuine article Mr. David
Dunne. The kind of person we
knew existed, from our
history.

Elijah points to the room full of pictures.

ELIJAH
It's time for someone like
you.
(beat)
Bad is winning. I can feel
it.

Elijah looks at David with deep admiration. His voice cracked a little at the end
of his words. Beat.

David doesn't take his hands out of his pockets.

DAVID(rattled)
I must have felt some lump
in his back when I bumped
him. Most guns have a black
or silver handle. I had a
fifty-fifty shot at the
color.

ELIJAH
That's not what I witnessed
David.

DAVID
Stop messing with my life
Elijah. My son almost shot
me last night. He wanted to
prove you were right.

ELIJAH
I never said you couldn't be
killed. I never said that.

DAVID
You have a problem, Elijah.
My wife is right. Somewhere
along the line one of your
bones broke and your mind
just broke with it.

Beat.

ELIJAH
Are you finished?

DAVID
No. And I have been sick. I
spent a week in a hospital
when I was a boy recovering
from pneumonia and almost
drowning.

DAVID
Two skinny eight year old
kids were playing around the
pool. They were dunking me.
I swallowed water. They
didn't know it and they
almost killed me.
(beat)
Heroes don't get killed like
that. Normal people do.

Beat. Elijah seems shaken for the first time. David stares at him coldly.

DAVID
I don't want to see you
again okay.
(soft)
Now I'm finished.

David turns and starts for the entrance. The BELL OF THE DOOR CLANGS as David
Dunne leaves the store.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

David exits the Limited Edition and moves down the street lost in this thoughts.
He bumps a man in a jacket and tie walking in the opposite direction.

FLASH CUT: THE SAME MAN STANDS IN A BAGGY SWEATER. AGAINST A PARKED CAR HE'S
HOLDING SOMETHING SHINY AND METALLIC IN HIS HANDS. HE INSERTS IT IN THE HALF INCH
GAP BETWEEN THE GLASS OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW AND THE DOOR. THE DOOR UNLOCKS.

THE MAN LOOKS AROUND QUIETLY BEFORE ENTERING THE CAR.

SLAM CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT:

David looks over his shoulder at the conservative looking man in a shirt and tie
walking down the street.

David Dunne is shaken. He turns and keeps walking.

CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

A superhero action figure and a plastic villain do battle on Jeremy's desk.

David sits dressed up in a white shirt and dress pants. He holds the villain.
Jeremy holds the superhero.

Megan enters the room in a beautiful brown dress.

MEGAN
The sitter's here.

David nods, ""yes."" Megan studies his tense expression.

MEGAN
We can do this another time
if you want? I'm fine with
anything.

David looks from the action figures, to his son's face to the face of his wife.
They both have the same quiet anxious expression. Beat.

DAVID
But I put cologne on.

Megan smiles.

MEGAN
Is that what that smell is?

Jeremy giggles.

CUT TO:

INT. DOWNTOWN COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT

An overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register. We
are in a low-end comic book store. The walls are lined with shelves of comic
books. The more expensive issues are kept in a glass case.

THE PONYTAIL MAN looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one
head is visible behind a low rack.

PONYTAIL MAN
Hey man it's twenty after.
It's time to close. I gotta
head.

The top of the man's head doesn't move. Beat.

PONYTAIL MAN
You better not be jacking
off to the Japanese comics.
I swear to God.

No response. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back.

As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair.
The Ponytail man walks ups to Elijah.

PONYTAIL MAN
Listen man, I didn't know
you were in-
(beat)
Just choose something all
right?

Elijah doesn't react. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans
over.

PONYTAIL MAN
Hello. You understand
English?

Ponytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of Elijah's face.

PONYTAIL MAN
Look man, I'm just gonna
wheel you out. You can think
about things outside on the
sidewalk. I gotta get some
chicken in me, you know what
I'm saying?

Beat. The Ponytail man shakes his head moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling
him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics.

Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left
leg hits a rack of comic books. A handful of comics tumbles to the ground.

PONYTAIL MAN
Shit.

The ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again.
After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the
wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. Comics are knocked free and
fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground.

PONYTAIL MAN
Dude, I don't care if you
are in a wheelchair. If you
do that again, I'm calling
Five-O.

Beat. The Ponytail man takes Elijah's silence as a, ""Yes."" He straightens the
chair.

They move down the aisle. All is quiet... and then Elijah jerks the wheelchair to
the left again. His metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks. Elijah
gets covered in comics.

PONYTAIL MAN
That's it crackerjack!
You're going to sit your ass
in jail now.

The Ponytail man moves to the front counter.

Elijah sits in a trance - slightly hunched over. His eyes stare at a comic book
in his lap. His expression changes for the first time.

The Ponytail man finishes dialing. He looks over to Elijah as he waits for a
voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand.

ELIJAH
How much is this one?

CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT

LATE EVENING. A trendy restaurant. Not enough light to read the menus.

David and Megan are on stools at one end of the bat. They sip their drinks as
they appear in deep thought.

DAVID
...I think rust.

MEGAN
Rust?

DAVID
As a color, not as rust. You
know, a rust colored paint
or wood?

Megan leans slightly closer.

MEGAN
I didn't know that. Mine's
still brown.

DAVID
My turn. What's your
favorite song?

MEGAN
Soft and Wet, by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.

DAVID
What was that?

MEGAN
We're supposed to be honest.

Beat. David brings his stool closer.

DAVID
Soft and Wet. That's very
interesting.

MEGAN
My turn.
(beat)
When was the first time the
thought popped into your
head that we might not make
it?

David's grin slowly fades.

DAVID
That's not the game.

Megan moves her stool closer. They're only a foot or so apart.

MEGAN
It's a second date. There
aren't any rules.

Beat. David sips his drink slowly.

DAVID
I'm not sure.

MEGAN
Think carefully?

DAVID
What about the game?

MEGAN
It's finished. I won.

Beat. David glances at Megan. She waits for his answer.

MEGAN
Maybe it wasn't a specific
moment, maybe it-

DAVID
I had a nightmare one night
and I didn't wake you up so
you could tell me it was
okay.
(beat)
I think that was the first
time.
(beat)
Does that count?

MEGAN(soft)
That counts.

Beat. Megan takes her glass up to her lips. Doesn't take a sip. Brings it back
down.

MEGAN
Do you knowingly keep Jeremy
and me at a distance?

Beat.

DAVID
Yes.

Megan's face tenses. She's on the verge of getting upset.

MEGAN
Why?

DAVID
I don't know Megan.

MEGAN
It's like you resent us
David. Resent the life you
have.

Beat. David doesn't answer.

MEGAN
You know even if it meant we
couldn't be together, I
would never have wished that
injury on you? What you
could so physically was a
gift. I would never have
wished it to go away.

Megan's eyes glaze with water. Beat.

MEGAN
You know that right?

David takes a sip with a trembling hand. David's eyes look up and make eye
contact with Megan's. He stares at her for the longest time.

DAVID(soft)
I know.

Husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second
date.

CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Megan stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet. The babysitter with the
black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway.

DYED HAIR GIRL
You got two calls. One came
through while I was on the
line - I wasn't talking too
long. There was an emergency
with my sister. She tried to
do her own perm and now she
looks like-

DAVID
Who called through?

Megan tries to hide her smile.

DYED HAIR GIRL
Someone from New York.

The smile instantly fades.

DYED HAIR GIRL
About a security job at a
museum. They want to hire
you.
(beat)
I didn't know you guys were
moving to New York. Thanks
for telling me.

MEGAN
We're not moving.

DYED HAIR GIRL
Oh.
(beat)
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly
quiet faces.

David hands her the money. She opens the door. It's started to rain.

DYED HAIR GIRL
Great.

The babysitter covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway. David
closes the door. Beat.

MEGAN
Look let's be honest here.
We're just at the beginning.
I don't expect you or I to
change the course of where
our lives were headed
because of two dates.
(beat)
If you do go to New York, we
can still develop this.
We'll just be forced to take
it slow. And in the end,
that's definitely better.
(beat)
This is our second time
around David. I don't expect
us to get carried away.
(beat)
I guess congratulations is
the right thing to say.

Megan takes off her coat as she moves to the guest bedroom. She disappears
inside. The door closely behind her.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Only the COUNTER LIGHT is on in the kitchen. David stands by the phone.

ELIJAH'S VOICE IS HEARD ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

ELIJAH(on tape)
...David. It's Elijah. It
was so obvious. It's
referred to over and over.
That's the key you see. The
repetition across time. That
means at some point it was
all based on common thought,
a common event - a fact.
(beat)
It was this one issue that
brought it back for me...
Century Comics
One-Seventeen. That's where
this group, the Coalition of
Evil, tried to ascertain the
weakness of every superhero.

ELIJAH(on tape)
...Because they all have
one.
(beat)
Just like you.
(beat)
The cells that make up your
muscles and your bones react
to forces that act upon it,
slightly different from than
mine. That's clear... Your
cells react to bacteria and
viruses slightly differently
than mine... That's also
clear...But for some reason,
you and I react the exact
same way to water. We
swallow it, we choke. We
swallow too much of it, we
drown. However unreal it may
seem, we are connected, you
and I, we are on the same
curve... just on opposite
ends.

ELIJAH
The point of all this is, we
now know something we
didn't... You have a
weakness... Water. It's your
krpytonite.
(beat)
You hearing me David? Call
me back... I got rugby
practice in an hour.

THE SOUND OF ELIJAH HANGING UP IS HEARD. THE ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS AS IT TURNS
OFF.

David hits a button on the answering machine. It makes a WHIRRING SOUND before
ANNOUNCING.

MACHINE
Message erased.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two
identical sinks sit opposite each other.

David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze
staring at the tiled floor.

His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of
the sinks.

David rises and picks it up.

It's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit
on its edge.

David opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he
hesitates.

His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A
CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS...
COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT...

David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own
identical mirrored medicine cabinet.

There are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND
COLOGNE.

David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares.

CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT.

David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt.

He moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word
""security"" is almost faded away.

He opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND.

CUT TO:

EXT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION - NIGHT

Rain falls like gunfire from the sky.

David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot.

David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head.

CUT TO:

EXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT

A steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of
interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate
with a lock stops his progress.

David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a
construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area
next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station
grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can
only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away
from the immaculately lit train station.

Beat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the
fence door that holds him back from going down.

CUT TO:

EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the
body of the caved-in passenger car.

The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line,
the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows
exposing the ravaged interior.

David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the
wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face.

His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow
breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE.

CUT TO:

FLASHBACK: EXT. STREET - NIGHT

SILENCE. BLACK. OUR VISION CLEARS TO REVEAL the glazed icy top of a street.

THE SOUND OF DISTANT FIRE COMES INTO THE SILENCE.

A TWENTY YEAR OLD DAVID DUNNE rises to his feet from the ground where he was
laying amongst the fragmented pieces of windshield. He looks down at himself. His
football jacket is torn. So are his jeans... He's trembling slightly, but not
bleeding.

HE LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE NOISES.

About thirty feet away is a Honda, upside down, wrapped around a telephone pole.
It's front is on fire.

Through one of the crushed door windows, WE SEE A WOMAN'S HAND.

Young David heads toward his car. He slips a couple of times on the slick iced
surface of the road.

He kneels down next to the inverted car. He looks in the crushed window frame.

THE FACE OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD MEGAN IS UPSIDE DOWN. She is unconscious.

DAVID
Megan...

She doesn't answer. Her body is twitching as it sits pinned behind the wheel.

David pulls at the handle of the mangled door. It's wedged tight. It won't move.

The heat from the fire is tremendous.

David's powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength.

WE HEAR THE CREAK OF METAL... THE DOOR BENDS UNNATURALLY AND THEN PRACTICALLY
RIPS OPEN.

David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan. He works her out underneath the
steering column. He slides out. Her leg is bleeding.

David picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the road. He lays her
down gently.

DAVID
Megan?

He just stares at her. She doesn't respond.

A LIGHT WASHES OVER THEM. David turns to see a truck approaching up the road.
David waves frantically. The truck slows.

David turns back to Megan. Her eyes are open.

Tears fall from David's face as he moves the hair out of her eyes. She looks at
David.

MEGAN(soft)
I thought I was dead.

Beat.

DAVID
Me too.

The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David.

DRIVER
Is she all right?

DAVID
I think her leg is
fractured.

DRIVER
Are you injured?

Beat. David looks at Megan who lays shivering in the grass. He looks back at the
driver.

DAVID(soft)
My shoulder's hurt.

The driver nods.

DRIVER
Hold on. I got a C.B. in the
truck.

The driver moves back to his truck.

David takes Megan's hand in his and waits in the grass by the sight of their car
on fire.

CUT TO:

PRESENT: EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT

David stands utterly still in the graveyard of train 177.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The wheels of Elijah's wheelchair move down the hall as he follows the SOUND OF
THE PHONE RINGING.

He follows THE SOUND to a PHONE RINGING in the storage room of the store. There
are shelves and shelves of comic books. Thousands of them filed away in neat
piles.

Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath.

ELIJAH
Hello.

DAVID'S VOICE
Elijah?

Beat.

ELIJAH
David?

Nothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats. WE HEAR THE ECHOED DIN
OF A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH PEOPLE AND MOVEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND.

DAVID'S VOICE
What am I supposed to do?

Elijah closes his eyes. His face fills with strength.

CUT TO:

INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a
football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a
misty hand painted ceiling.

ELIJAH(v.o.)
David, it's okay to be
afraid. Because this part
won't be like a comic
book... Real life doesn't
fit into little boxes that
were drawn for it.

David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and
departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic
throughout the station.

ELIJAH(v.o.)
Go to where people are...
You won't have to look very
long.

David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them.

He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It
watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier
to heaven.

David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving
passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as
they move.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES
STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE.

SHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS
COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards
the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving.

David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information
board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady
spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side.

David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines
of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either
side of him.

David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side.
His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by.

Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt
and slicked back hair brushes by...

FLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S
HOLDING A BOTTLE OF BEER.

SLICKED HAIR MAN
Go back to Africa!

THE SLICKED HAIR MAN THROWS THE BOTTLE WITH FORCE AS HE PASSES A CLACK FAMILY
WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE BOTTLE SHATTERS AS IT HITS A WOMAN IN THE GROUP.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the
information booth. He watches him for a beat.

FLASH CUT: WE ARE IN A BEDROOM. A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE TEENS LOOKS DOWN AT A
GIRL LAYING IN A PILE OF OVERCOATS ON A BED. THERE IS LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS.

TEENAGER
What's your name? I think
you drank too much.

THE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP
HER THIGH.

THE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING
BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and
greets a group of identically dressed friends.

Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep
breaths as he gathers himself.

Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing
behind him.

David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus.

FLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR.
HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW
FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN
DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE.

GLASSY EYED MAN
Can I come in?

MAN IN HOUSE
Who are you?

GLASSY EYED MAN
I like your house. Can I
come in?

MAN IN HOUSE
What is this?
(beat)
No you can't come in.

Beat.

GLASSY EYED MAN
Are you sure?

The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it.
The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him.

MAN IN HOUSE
What are you doing?

The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening...
It opens slowly anyway.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable.

David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing
shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and
then finally onto the man.

He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive.
He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM.

The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the
full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full
trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it.

David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked ""Station
Maintenance Staff Only"".

Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his
bin inside.

David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the
longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the
doors.

And then they open.

The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's
wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit.

David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him.

CUT TO:

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city
block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at
this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet
behind.

The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The
uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves.

He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail
out of the mailbox.

David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He
stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks
over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled
house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.

CUT TO:

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps
into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM.

A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or
three days worth.

David shuts the door very slowly.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE
KITCHEN.

David stares out from under his hood at the mess.

Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of
unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits
frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of
colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two
cockroaches are crawling in the bowl.

David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets
closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open
quietly.

A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom
of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the
flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies
folded over itself on his still chest.

CUT TO:

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in
a pyramid on the coffee table.

David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense.

THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and
follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM.

David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION.

CUT TO:

INT. GIRL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one.

It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are
everywhere. The room is empty.

A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists
with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms
pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest.

Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and
seated in the same way.

Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes
half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded
figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping
water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them.

They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them.
They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them.
They boy blinks once slowly.

David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood.

DAVID
You need to leave now.

CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes
hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on
top of it.

David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the
other side of the bedroom.

A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped
against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable
bruises on her face and arms.

David stands before her.

DAVID(soft)
Where is he?

The woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The
curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside.

David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony.
An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it.

David steps onto the balcony and looks down.

The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers
a pool in the backyard.

David turns to go back inside.

A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM.

The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into
David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing.

The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly
towards the black tarp.

CUT TO:

EXT. POOL - NIGHT

David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp.

There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his
cheek. Half his face is covered in water.

Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets
pounded by the rain.

David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water
as his pressure pushes the tarp down.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START.

David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the
tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place.

The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY.

One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the
edge of the pool.

And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the
tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER.

CUT TO:

EXT.  UNDER WATER - NIGHT

David's body is tangled in the pool cover. His legs and arms thrash against the
constricting black tarp. He's drowning.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER. THE BLURRED
IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS.

The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place
around the edge of the pool.

The rain keeps falling.

The tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with
every movement.

GLIMPSES OF LIGHT AGAIN. TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED SILHOUETTE NEAR
THE EDGE OF THE POOL. FLASHES OF SOMETHING SHINY THEY'RE HOLDING... A ROD OR
POLE... IT'S SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE.

David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole.

The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the
pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the
pool's edge.

Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of
the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground.

He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain
poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat.

He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing,
calming.

He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the
two small figures standing near the edge of the pool.

The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an
aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the
hooded figure.

No one says anything.

CUT TO:

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door
handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he
looks down at her.

He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move
closer. Right behind him.

The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching
over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.

David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp
together like and iron vise. He squeezes.

The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.

David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back
violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard
stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.

The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall.
David's arm remains locked around his throat.

The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm.
He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The
room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.

And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in
David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate
blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.

The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.

David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his
tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE
APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.

David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just
dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the
carpet now.

David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the
man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat.

David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw.
The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE
ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat.

He moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone
cords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her.

DAVID(soft)
It's over now.
(beat)
Your children are fine.
They're getting help.

He unties her wrists. Her arms stay above her head where they were.

DAVID(soft)
I'm going to go now.

He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally
still against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run
down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down.

David moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath
against his hand. Beat.

He rises up. Removes his hood. David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom
of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position
against her bathroom door.

CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

The front door opens to SILENCE. The silhouetted figure of David steps into the
darkness of his home.

CUT TO:

INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

The dark green faded security poncho gets hung back on its hook in the closet
next to the family winter coats.

CUT TO:

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David enters the quiet of Jeremy's room. Jeremy lays sound asleep. David stares
down at the shadowy figure of his son.

He pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder.

CUT TO:

INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

David sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room.

He doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch. He is so still, he seems to
disappear into the shadows of the room.

CUT TO:

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Megan stirs in her sleep. She shifts her head on the pillow.

Then her body RISES INTO THE AIR.

She starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees
David close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her.
No words are spoken.

CUT TO:

INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT

They enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed.

She watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her.

He covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly.

DAVID(soft)
I had a bad dream.

David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes.

Megan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat.

MEGAN(soft)
It's over now.

She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

Downtown Philadelphia.

People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is
among them.

He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the
store are open.

A banner over the door reads, ""Annual Sale.""

CUT TO:

INT. LIMITED EDITION - DAY

The compact store is crowded with customers.

David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic
hero.

David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits. He turns and looks at
a framed sketch.

Beat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David.

WOMAN
...See the villain's eyes.
They're larger than the
other characters'. They
insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective of how they see
the world. Just off normal.

David stares at the drawing.

DAVID
He doesn't look very
threatening.

WOMAN
That's what I said to my
son. He said, there's always
two kinds. The soldier
villain who fights the hero
with his hands, and then
there's the real threat. The
brilliant and evil arch
enemy who fights the hero
with his mind.

David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her
sixties who stands next to him.

DAVID
Are you Elijah's mother?

The woman turns and looks at David for the first time.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
I am. I'm helping him with
the sale.

DAVID
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm David Dunne.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
He's spoken of you. He says
you're becoming friends.

DAVID
We are.

David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers.

DAVID
He's doing well today.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
I'm very proud of him.
(beat)
He's been through a lot in
his life. A lot of ups and
downs, a lot of bad spells.
A couple I'd thought had
broken him... I mean
emotionally.
(beat)
They were bad... But he made
it. Yes he did.

DAVID
He's kind of a miracle.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
Yes he is.

They both watch Elijah from across the room.

ELIJAH'S MOTHER
I'll tell him you're here.

David watches as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to
finish talking.

David turns back to the framed sketch. He looks at it with his hands in his
pockets. Beat.

David's stare turns into a gaze. His gaze turns into stillness.

THE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes. He sits in the shadows.
He's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the
machine. The machine has wheels.

David turns from the sketch. He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his
wheelchair. Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes
negotiating.

David turns back to the sketch. He looks at it with growing confusion. The more
you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a
wheelchair.

David looks back across the store. Elijah and his mother are talking. Elijah has
spotted David.

Beat. Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David. He wheels up to him.

ELIJAH
Did you see this?

Elijah has a newspaper on his lap. He holds it up.

There's a drawing on the front page. It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled
children behind him.

ELIJAH(soft)
It has begun.

David stares quietly at the sketch of himself.

ELIJAH
When I saw it this morning.
I felt a part of the world
again.

Elijah looks down at the newspaper.

David hesitates and then reaches forward.

He reaches past the paper... And TOUCHES ELIJAH'S ARM.

FLASHCUT: AN AIRPORT GATE. ELIJAH IS STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE
AIRFIELD. HE'S CRYING.

SIRENS START SOUNDING THROUGHOUT THE AIRPORT.

WAITING PASSENGERS START GETTING UP AND MOVING TO THE WINDOWS.

MAN
What's going on?

Elijah speaks to no one in particular as he stares out the window with tortured
eyes.

ELIJAH
A plane just crashed.

CUT TO:

FLASH CUT: ELIJAH AND AN ELDERLY MAN IN A UNIFORM ARE SEATED IN A HOTEL BAR.

ELDERLY MAN
I've worked here twenty-five
years. I know all its
secrets.

ELIJAH
Secrets?

ELDERLY MAN(whispers)
Like if there was ever a
fire on floors one, two, or
three... Everyone in this
hotel would be burned alive.

ELIJAH LOOKS UP FROM HIS DRINK.

CUT TO:

FLASHCUT: ELIJAH LEAVES THE ENGINEERING ROOM OF AN AMTRAK TRAIN. HE PASSES THE
ENGINEER WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED WITH COFFEE.

ENGINEER
Passengers aren't allowed in
there.

Elijah doesn't answer and doesn't turn around as he exits train 177.

SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David takes two unsteady steps back. Elijah has tears in his eyes as he gazes
down at the newspaper. He looks up to David.

ELIJAH(low voice)
I almost gave up hope. There
were so many times I
questioned myself. I've made
so many sacrifices but it's
all been worth it.
(beat)
There are millions and
millions or mediocre people
in the world David. Isn't it
great that we aren't one of
them?

David looks like he stopped breathing as he backs up in the store.

Customers step between him and Elijah. Elijah becomes obscured and then blocked
from view.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

David emerges from the store slowly. He braces himself against a parked car and
then keeps on walking in a nightmarish daze.

WE PULL BACK as David Dunne blends in with dozens and dozens of ordinary people,
walking on an ordinary street, in an ordinary city.

Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

[Chorus]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

[Verse 2]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

[Outro]
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Judy Garland,1986,"[71, 59, 45, 29, 18, 12, 9, 10, 13, 18, 25, 31, 42, 49, 72, 94]",16
71,Girlfriend,"[Intro]
Why the fuck this bitch texting my phone?
You're not my girlfriend

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
Ridin' through the city, I ain't know that she was with it
She was tryna get with me so I had to get busy
See I met her at the Lenox, she was tryna buy some Jimmy's
And that ass like Serena like she had to play tennis, ayy
Swervin' on corner like skrrt (skurrrrt)
She said, ""Can I text you?"" I'm like sure (surrrre)
And I got on Gucci like burr
Shawty you gon' have to shave the fur (cut it off)
And I might come ballin' like I'm Stephen Curry
Space Jam, Bill Murray, Munchies, Oreo McFlurry, whoa
I can't even lie, shawty thick and she purty
Work at the Blue Flame she doin' tricks up on that pole
I ain't even know that's your girlfriend
I'ma pass her like I'm Kyrie Irving
I'ma just take trips to Berlin
Why you tryna flex like you a virgin?

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

[Verse 2]
Get out my lane, that's candy paint
Took out the brain, I'm at the flame
We not the same, Louis V frame
Look where I came, from Marta trains
Look at my game, I'm like King James
I'm making movies, just like the Wayans
Fuck what she sayin', she want a ring
Pimpin' ain't easy, Big Daddy Kane
Baby Ion't even know yo name
Hundred on the dash like I'm Dame
She wanna take trips to Romane
Call me David, I'm the one to blame
I can't even do it, babe, sorry, I can't even lie
Why you tryna fuck with me babe? You got another guy
She said, ""Can I come again?"" Maybe, girl, another time
Tramp stamp on her back, what is that a butterfly?
Blowin' on the gas from the Amoco
I just hit yo girl in my Polo Pajamas tho
Gotta stay strapped like I'm Rambo tho
And she thick and she pretty (like who?) like Amber Rose

[Chorus]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend

72,We Connect,"[Chorus]
We connect
When we're together it's so perfect
Boy, you shock me with your wide hot love
I start to overload, I explode when we connect

[Verse 1]
It's no exaggeration, not imagination
You're the finest boy around
Playing with temptation, overnight sensation
With a boy from the wrong side of town

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me your love and affection
Dance with me tonight
Give me all of your attention
Dancing in love's light

She don't, she don't, she don't, she don't
She don't want him, she don't want him anymore
She don't, she don't, she don't, she don't
She don't want him anymore

[Verse 1]
Don't know why I try
Don't know why I wake up sometimes
In the middle of the night, I'll wait for you
You don't even call me up or text me back
Don't give a fuck
I don't know why I-I try
I cry, I cry, I cry my eyes out
Hmm, so I just wait
Why the wait?
I give it all
And you just take

[Chorus]
Some people act single even when they're in love
(She don't, she don't)
Some people forgetful, even when they're in love
Even when they're in love

[Verse 2]
Usually much more confident than I am with you
I don't know why I take the things I do
Try to make conversation, but talking loops
These loops, these loops, these loops
Wish you wouldn't lie to me
When you're here lying with me
I just want something deeper
Than what you think is, deep

[Chorus]
Some people act single even when they're in love
(She don't, she don't) Hmm
Some people forgetful, even when they're in love
Even when they're in love

74,Goin' To The Bank,"She knows I want her
She knows I need her

She knows she got my love
But I'm apprehensive
She's so expensive, girl

Just can't get enough
I'm the one who does 9 to 5
Hustlin' for my bread

While she's decidin' what dress to buy
Layin' around in my bed

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me, got me

Drives my Mercedes
Lunch with the ladies
She loves the finer things
What have I created

Now I'm afraid to see what tomorrow brings
She don't know what it does to me trying to keep her in line
If love is just a big charge account
Why'd it have to be mine?

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me, got me

Hello, oh hi
Can I help you today?
Yeah
I'd like to make another withdrawal

Again? Yeah, again
Well, as you know
By now there is a substantial penalty
For early withdrawal

She knows I love her
Knows how I need her
She knows I really care
I can't afford her

I should've taught her, I ain't no billionaire
Gotta get her to understand soon the will be dry
If she don't love the simple things
Maybe I'm the wrong guy

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me, got me

She thinks she saves me money buyin' everything on sale
But she believes in quantity
Now I'm afraid to open my mail
Goin' for the bank
She got me goin' to the bank

Now the girl's gotta look good for me

But this is going too far
'Cause she won't feel so beautiful when they repossess my car
Goin' to the B A N K
She got me goin' to the bank

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me, got me

75,Suburbia,"[Part I: Jesus of Suburbia]

[Verse 1]
I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of ""None of the above""
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my
Sins in Hell, as far as I can tell
At least the ones I got away with

[Chorus]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In the land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Verse 2]
Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room on my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine

[Chorus]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Part II: City of the Damned]

[Verse 1]
At the center of the Earth in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says ""home is where your heart is"" but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

[Chorus]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care

[Verse 2]
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

[Chorus]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)

[Part III: I Don't Care]

[Chorus]
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care!

[Verse]
Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia

[Bridge]
Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe (Sons, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe
And I don't care (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care (Woo, woo, woo)
I don't care

[Part IV: Dearly Beloved]

[Verse 1]
Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

[Verse 2]
Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

[Part V: Tales of Another Broken Home]

[Verse 1]
To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

[Chorus]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

[Verse 2]
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
The lights of masochists

[Chorus]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized

You're leaving
You're leaving
You're leaving
Ah, you're leaving home",Green Day,1986,"[76, 84, 90, 97]",4
76,Without Your Love,"[Introduction]

[Verse 1]
Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes

[Verse 2]
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day

[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime

[Bridge]
The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime",Chris Stapleton,1986,[77],1

80,True To You,"[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Here we go to church on Sunday mornin'
Hangovers on 'em
Whiskey pourin' out of skin, it's like a poison
Beer-soaked boots from the barroom floor
It's perfume to a sinner, it's allurin'
Prophet for the slums, prayer for the dark
Barber straight razor blade, pocket watch
Rings on every finger, sacrificial skin
Story written in his blood, he's akin
To animals and criminals alike
Hood, project, trailer park, Backwoods
Sprinkles of the cocaine in his nails
Tank full of propane on the shelf
Fire's in the soul, the child is now a man
The enemies of good now become a friend
Watchin' God play his life violin
Happily, an instrumental in the wind
You will never fit, you're a misfit
You're a quiet voice no matter how loud you get
Despite the effort, you remain reckless
You remain helpless in the same outfit
As your father did before, you're a song
Better sing the praises of the written wrongs
Only time will kill your spirit if you let it fall
And that's why there's...

[Chorus: Bones Owens]
No time at all
No time like now
To get on the road
If you wanna get out
You got to be true
True to yourself
Or you'll be a fool

The rifle's in the corner, money on the table
Cellophane sacks, baby's in the cradle
Chevy's in the drive, cranked and ready for him
Lights a cigarette, ashes on the floor
And takes another toke, smoke fills the room
Sun sets behind the clouds, heavy gloom
Cops on the run, sirens in the distance
Wild small town, violent and resistant
In the street, they rage and fight
Any given night, it's just another reason for a killin'
Brave the cold and lock the door 'cause it's war
Storm filled with crime, only safe in buildings
Made of brick and mortar, brick of thick morals
Ain't got brick and mortar? Steel will support 'em
Steel with the trigger finger, take your life
Billy in the basement, wasted, makin' pipe
Bombs take it light, wrong take it real
Take a quarter pound of dope and make a deal
Take the front, son, run for the hills
Cowards under power make sonic seals
Cast a shadow over underprivileged minds
While they're chasin' money, hit some basic rhymes
If the world gives you pen and paper, draw the line
Because there's no time

The Mississippi Delta
Was shining like a National guitar
I am following the river down the highway
Through the cradle of the civil war

[Chorus]
I'm going to Graceland, Graceland
Memphis, Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland

My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received in Graceland

[Verse 2]
She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead

And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow

[Chorus]
I'm going to Graceland
Memphis, Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland

And my traveling companions are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received in Graceland

[Verse 2]
There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
""Whoa, so this is what she means""
She means we're bouncing into Graceland

And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Well, everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody feels the wind blow

[Chorus]
Ooh
In Graceland, Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received in Graceland

It's ringing out across the universe
It sounds so lost and lonely
It must come from somewhere deep inside of us
And the operator says
""All is calm
All is quiet
Close your eyes and sleep tonight""

This is the world calling
This is earth
This is the world calling
This is us

I'm on a train now
I'm moving through the yellow fields of rape
There's so much beauty
I wished that I believed enough to pray
Then the operator says
""Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue
There's no-one looks as good as you""

This is the world calling
This is us
And it goes on and on

What we going to do because it can't go on
Wrap me in your arms and keep me warm tonight

This is the world calling

But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

[Chorus 1:Allure]
I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

[112]
(Ooh I'm over you, oh yeah you, yes)

[Verse 2:Slim, (112), & Allure]
Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool, baby
(Why was I such a fool) Oh, yeah
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone

[Pre-Chorus 2:Allure & Slim]
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Tears will cause an inferno baby
Romance often fades why should I take the blame?
Why should... why should I?
You were the one who left me neglected
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected

[Chorus 2:Allure & 112]
I...
I gave you all of me (I gave you all of me)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
I...
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Over you

[Chorus 3:Allure & 112]
I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you... (Left me so confused)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out (All cried out)
So sorry
Over you

84,Foolish Pride,"[Intro: Eminem & Manix]
Yo man, yo Marsh, man
Yo, you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself
What of the homies, man?
Oh you want one about the posse? Alright

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride

[Verse: Eminem]
Well foolish pride has a lot of things to say
You got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks and whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back 'til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'ma say look honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass
I said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'ma say, ""Look honey""
I've already said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when Mike catch on the bass line
That's okay ‘cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point, black girls are bitches
That's why I'ma tell you, you better pull up your britches
‘Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a god damn spanking
From me, the funky M&M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say ""swallowing"" phlegm and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
'Cause— I forgot the chorus
But that's okay cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
So I'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you've got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot
In your hand
So I'ma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go?
I forgot
But that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride
I'ma say, ""Ole foolish pride""

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide",Eminem,1986,"[85, 60, 35, 33, 36, 38, 39, 45, 51, 62, 75]",11

I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

What ecstasy has come over me?
I don’t care if I ever wake or die
Pleasure’s killing me, dancin’ in my sleep
Voices call my name, very far away
But I must remain, hear the music play
Never in my life have I felt so free
Lighter than the air, as I laugh and leap
No step I won’t dare, dancin’ in my sleep
Round and round and round and round and
Round and round and round and round I go
As I drop and sway in my dream ballet
No one on this earth ever danced this way
Never heel or toe miss a single beat
Precious memory I will always keep
When I wake I pray, dancin’ in my sleep",Kristin Andreassen,1986,"[91, 92, 92]",3

On a typical male, on a typical male

[Verse 2]
Your sense of justice i'll embrace
But your defense don't help my case
I'm deep in trouble with the law
Something about authority
Seems to bring out the bad in me
Hey lawyer got to catch me when i fall
Oh they say that you match your wits
With the best of them
But i know when i'm close you're just
Like the rest of them

All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

So put your books aside
Loosen off the suit and tie
And open up your heart and let me in
Now open up your heart and let me in

[Chorus]
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

[Bridge]
The reaction
I'm just using my feminine charm
On a typical male, on a typical

112,A Matter Of Trust,"I sense you're feeling down
Trying to fight the fight on your own
You can't seem to find your way around it
Well you were never meant to make it alone
You've been wondering why you can't understand it
Circumstances don't match your point of view
When we want to find the way that God's planned it
There's only one thing we need to do

(Chorus)
Give it up, just let go
Let God have the control of your life
You will see, He can move mountains
If you have the faith to believe
Yes it's true, He will carry you through
When your heart's not strong enough
It's only a matter of trust

Don't be afraid to relinquish
If we rely on ourselves we will lose
''cause when we can't put together the pieces
There's only one thing we need to do

(Repeat Chorus)

Says put your troubles down beside me
Things have always been the same

And rock and roll can't teach me, no, what the river said that night

We can not live apart

I can see the future

To make you change your mind?
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turnin' upside down

And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me

This is the point of no return, I could never go back

But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no comin' back for me

Just like the Spanish exterminatin' Tainos
Rapin' the black and Indian women, creatin' Latinos
Motherfuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred

A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection, strapped down, ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace?
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets

How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country?

Human beings killin' monkeys to conquer the planet

This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens

Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me, nigga
'Cause once you past the point, you can never go home

When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own?
It rains acid, one day the Earth will cry from a stone

Computerized humanity livin' inside of a clone

I had this dream that I was floating
I had this dream that I was on top of the tallest building
And I could see everything around me
And I crept my toes over the edge
I had this dream that I was floating
I had the dream that I was on top
And I crept my toes over the edge
And I dropped everything I was holding

[Verse 1: Sims]
I’m tearing down all these outmoded ideas about now
How it’s going, what it is, and how it sounds
And I walk like midnight city in my grip like
Won’t let it slip until I get light
I’m burning all these old bodies, holding no vigils
See which pieces send smoke signals
No combing the ash, let the breeze sort it out
Boarded-out, that house I tore it down

[Hook: Mike Mictlan]
When it all boils down there’s nothing but bones left
When it all boils down there’s nothing but bones left
When it all boils down there’s nothing but bones left
When it all boils down there’s nothing but bones left
Nothing but bones left, nothing but bones

[Verse 2: Dessa]
And it’s the same safe
But the codes won’t work
Guess the joke’s on me
Looks like I’m on first
The map got turnt
Or the river took out the bridge
But we can’t get out
The way that we came in
The compass needle is sticking
The numbers step out of sequence
The stars here look hardly like the ones from last season
And we’ve been leaking diesel since the first freeze
You can leave the car keys in it
I’m getting out

Each brick is a pixel
Each step is a stitch in the dust
Grass it’ll whistle
Buzzed by the breath in your lungs
Get your day in the sun to be young
Streamers on the handlebars
Soft drugs and underwire
Love’s a funny animal
Be careful what you tell yourself
Fairy tales and anecdotes
Both dangerous for amateurs
Born hunter-gatherers
Agriculture-made matadors
Now given all we’ve wanted for
We watch it on the monitors

[Verse 3: Mike Mictlan]
And you won’t know me by incisors or metacarpus
Claim carcass, head on the wall, body starting the metamorphose
They say we bitterly hold grudge
Distorted intent, well consider the sources
Cow tongue, it’s utterly horseshit
Huddled up, the rudder stuck, redirected our forces
Polyamory: fuck everybody
We devoted to the family, balance against the gravity
Self-hate, rediscovered inside misandry
Clean slate, my desire to rule the man in me
Fever for fire, the flame vapor, the skin paper, the blood thicker
Vein fill up sure as a shape-shifter
Follow forward with the sense of the spot blown
Call it origin, everything before it the Dead Zone
Underworld nan-god indivisible
No subliminal, every bit of mass is not critical
Deity Retired, just remember I lived
Cause you won’t know me by my skull or my rib
Locked in, clocked out
Yeah it is what it is
Just remember I lived
Cause you won’t know me by my skull or my rib
Locked in, clocked out
Yeah it is what it is

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Cecil Otter]
And I’m running to home, it’s running me dry
I loved the road but love can be blind
Covered in gold, covered in pride
Under an oath, under-disguised
And suffered the smoke stuck in your eyes
And we priced it, sold its name, nine sips of Novocaine
I sit inside a cell and side with the kinda hell
That likes when you show its pain
Lives off your fear of heights
Strikes when it’s all the same, and it’s feeling like
Like it’s a say anything moment
The reckonings are everywhere, the mezzanine’s closing
So I ain’t holding nothing on safety
Running up the towers, I was running on empty
Break me, shape me under the knife
Raise me up til I’m grown, break another device to set free
Shake the love of my life, tell them nothing was wrong
Tell me nothing was right, prestige

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sims]
This time I slit the throat ruthless
Profuse rouges out the wound
Washing out these blueprints
Hammers to these lead balloons
Cement shoes and useless abuses
{​Leave the wolf--leave the wolf}​ Leave the wolf toothless
I had this dream that I was floating
Free from these explosions in the subtle
Cuffs uncoupled
When I woke wildfire turned the broken into rubble
Turned myself into molten
Poured out what isn’t potent

[Break: Sims]
I had this dream that I was floating

Uh, respect given where it’s livin'
Peace to non-violents populating the prisons
Bag of dicks, follow the money track
Chew on that if you profit off of somebody’s back
Atlas with the standards
Sickle's sharp and red as fuck with my hammer
Chisel tippin', chisel chippin', shaping scenery
Hit the prism, catch a vision, whiff of unity
Let 'em dip and sweat and trip out on the tryptamines
Instead of feeling it’s better living through chemistry
Or probably extra feeling everything
Hyper-realing the fuck out of nights because days sting
And playthings save sentiments
Pain brings them same things to resent and quit
So it’s a chest full of broke toys
And no noise is loud enough to drown me
Got your boy turning every knob to the right
Every button with an arrow up crushed
'Til my vision is bright white
Mute the dialogue, watch the lips move
Change the script around, make that bullshit tight
I been a real self-starter
Found myself swimmingly, real hot water
Since I was young I seem to feel this harder
These guys are fucking kidding me
World made for LARPers
I tend to ghost, knapsack, arrow, and stealth
Full of mean and a copy of Health Is in You!
Sometimes it be like that
Just gotta put the pipe down and get your feelings back, ya heard?

Pulling down cloud nine, pissing on dreams

124,Love In Siberia,"I can feel something just ain't right
I can see when you sleep at night
In your dreams there is no way you can find peace of mind

When we touch all the fires gone
Mean too much I won't let you run out of me
As I watch our love grow old, turning cold

Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away

Could it be I just need you more
Can't you see what you got in store
If you stay I will never let you go, oh no

Try to reach, try to hold me tight
One and each, we must try and fight
Get it cool where we used to be sincere 'cause we're
('Cause we are)

Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away

Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia

125,I Want To Make The World Turn Around,"I don't wanna live in a world of darkness
I wanna live in a world of light
I don't wanna live in a world that's heartless
I wanna live in a world of sight
Well you know (you know, you know)
I want to make the world turn around
Make the world turn around
Make the world turn around

Living in a world of justice
Living in a world of shame
Living in a world of freedom
Living in a world of pain
You know (you know, you know)
I want to make the world turn around
Make the world turn around
Make the world turn around

Turn the darkness into light

126,Heartbeat,"[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 1]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
'Cause

[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat

[Verse 2]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go 100
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
69 is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke
And light

[Hook]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 3]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money, then you burn me, then you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that

128,Friends And Lovers,"[Verse 1]
I'm a ne'er do well
Running out of black gold
It's high time I pulled over
And walked around for a while

I've seen the porcelain shell
Your exoskeleton
And I feel like we'd walk well together

[Chorus]
Because in the end, we are friends and lovers

[Verse 2]
If asked of me I would
Gobble them to bits
The things that wall us off from
Where we belong

What's wrong with you is good
For what's wrong with me
And I think maybe we should stick together

[Chorus]
Because in the end, we are friends and lovers
We are friends and lovers

[Verse 3]
Abandon all the bones
We've got to pick
They'll only weigh us down and
We are better than that

If they all throw stones
Start a collection
Of everything we're not
And won't because

Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings.

[Chorus]
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And the homecoming queen

And we're out here on the edge
But we're still standing
Baby we haven't fallen yet

The way you're looking at me
That you just want the same things
That I do
All I want is to make love to you
There's really nothing to say
Don't let our words get in the way

We both know love's not perfect
It's good, it's bad, it's everything
You know what makes it worth it
For the all the moments in between
There's a deep ocean
Sometimes it's sink or swim
These are real emotions
So baby let's dive in

I don't want to talk anymore tonight
Falling through the trap
Of who's wrong and who's right
It's easy to see
The way you're looking at me
That you just want the same things
That I do
All I want is to make love to you
There's really nothing to say

133,Like Flames,"Like Flames!

Something you've heard, somewhere you've seen
Too real to ignore
You've chosen not to believe
From the black of their pain, to the white of their fear
In the dust they die
While Eden lies near

The freedom bought, changed hands, was sold
This heat of love has turned ice-cold

We just can't escape it
Like flames reaching out from the sun
We can't defeat it
Like flames reaching out from the sun

From the garden of love, been banished too long
And the balance will shift
Between the week and the strong
Once they would beg and they would plead
But now they demand
Divided by those that need
And those that command

The freedom bought, changed hands, was sold
The heat of love has turned ice-cold and
We never learn but we know too well
Heaven's died and gone to Hell

We just can't escape it
Like flames reaching out from the sun
We can't defeat it
Like flames reaching out from the sun

Now you watch but you should have run
Like flames that leap from the base of the sun
And you dream you're free but you'll awake
Too much too late, too much too late

The freedom bought, changed hands, was sold
The heat of love has turned ice-cold and
We never learn but we know too well
Heaven's died and gone to Hell

We just can't escape it
Like flames reaching out from the sun
We can't defeat it
Like flames reaching out from the sun",Berlin,1986,"[95, 82, 87, 92, 93]",5

But that don't mean that I had everything to say
But then I saw you in L.A
And it was there that things began to change
Baby, I feel there's something in your heart
That is trying to get through to me

You know now, honey
You know you caught me by surprise
'Cause I see it coming through your eyes
I see heaven in your eyes
You know, the stars shine through your eyes

And so I started hanging 'round
But then I felt that I was getting in the way
So I started to leave
You turned around and looked me in the eyes
Baby, you know you got me then and there
There was nothing I could say or do

You know now, honey
Yes, I got to be with you
'Cause I'm caught up in your gorgeous eyes
I see heaven in your eyes
You know, the stars shine through your eyes

Heaven in your eyes
The stars shine through your eyes
I see heaven in your eyes
Your love I can't deny

Baby, you know you got me then and there
There was nothing I could say or do
You know now, honey, yes
I got to be with you
'Cause I'm caught up in your gorgeous eyes

You know now, baby
You know you got me then and there
There was nothing I could say or do
You know now, honey, yes
I got to be with you
'Cause I'm caught up in your gorgeous eyes
I see heaven in your eyes
You know, the stars shine through your eyes

It's just the way you look at me
Heaven in your eyes
It's just the way you smile at me
Heaven's in your eyes
It's just the way you call my name
Heaven's in your eyes
It's just the way you walk toward me
Heaven's in your eyes

Baby, I feel there's something in your heart
That is trying to get through to me
(Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, yeah)
Honey, you know you caught me by surprise
'Cause I see it coming through your eyes

You know now, baby
I feel there's something in your heart

I'm not the one to say how much I care

Everytime you cry I cry just a little bit
-cry just a little bit
When you say goodbye, I die just a little bit
-cry just a little bit more

I know it's late, I guess I should have called today
I know you're tired of waiting by the phone
I know you said-you just don't know how long you'll wait
I know that you can live your life alone

Everytime you cry I cry just a little bit
-cry just a little bit
When you say goodbye, I die just a little bit
-cry just a little bit more

In a world where there's no one to turn to
In a world where you think there's no one but you

But everytime you need someone to dry your eyes
You call my name and know that I'll be there

Everytime you cry I cry just a little bit
-cry just a little bit
When you say goodbye, I die just a little bit
-cry just a little bit more
Everytime you cry I cry just a little bit

Contact is all it takes
To change your life to lose your place in time
Contact! Asleep or awake
Coming around you may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever, you realize

[Chorus]
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string

[Verse 2]
Another world, some other time
You lay your sanity on the line
Familiar faces familiar sights
Reach back, remember with all your might
Ooh, there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down

[Chorus]
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ah, sleep and dream, that's all I crave
I travel far across the Milky Way
To my master I become a slave
Til we meet again some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before

[Chorus]
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

139,Good Music,"[?uestlove]
Peace to all the hip cats, all the nappy sweets
This is the BROther ?uestion, broadcastin' live
Via satellite from the Never Never Tunnels
Now dig, the rituals for today is good music
So, sit back, relax and dig the groove

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks the hip-hop
Not R&B because to me, that's not my style and
The R-double-O-quotes ain't for radio, but major soul
The ones that's hip won't change the dial and
I remember one mornin' at the Soul Shack
Coolin' in the outback, on the slow ridin' ship
Blaze a five off a Bob Marley spliff
On the cloud, I be relaxin' from last night and shit
In studio today, but hey BROther ?uestion
Was on the West Side, asleep without a clue when
I hollered down to Crumbs to pick up the phone
And tell him to get ready (?uestion, what ya doin?)
(Ain't no thing) but a chicken wing, so I met him in the West
Where we had to 'lax and wait for Rubber Band and Bas'
Bassey broke down on the other side of town
Yo, you know what it's about, The Roots is out, to the subway

[Hook x2]
Does anybody like real music? Sweet music, soul music?
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it
Just to use it, to make you move it, yeah

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
From the subway to the studio
Gots to break fast if we wanna get to the bus
Runnin' like a Mex' for the border
(Umm, yo, oh umm, was it a bunch of ya's?)
Nah, just the four of us
'Nuff nappy sweets on the transit, two fine
(Three fine) fo' fine, mo' fine, UHH!
A girl says, ""Hey, ain't y'all The Square Roots?""
And I'm like, ""Heh, word""
And then the shorty passed the sign
Now, we got to make our exit (Where?)
To the pavement (To what?), to crush a trail mix
(Oh, word man, yo, look out) Say what? (Look out!)
?uestion dropped a whole bag of drumsticks
(Ain't no thing, haha), but a chicken wing, so
He bends down to pick up the sticks
And his pants fall down (Dang!)
In my face, ?uestion didn't frown, turned around
And thought he felt a draft, so I laughed
(Hahahahaha!)

[Hook x2]

[Bridge: Kid Crumbs]

141,This Love,"[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me

Top Gun Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
Take My Breath Away (Love Theme From Top Gun)
By Giorgio Moroder, Tom Whitlock
Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Watching I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion

We'll stop at nothing
To get what we want
Can't fight the feeling
There's no moving on

[Verse 2: Annie LeBlanc, Brooke Butler]
Knockin' on your front door, steppin' in the DMS
Dreaming of my first kiss, I think this could be it
It all feels the same
Hanging on your last snap, watching it on replay
Dreaming what you feel like, thinking it's the best day

[Verse 1]
Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, ""You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways.""
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing ""Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care.""
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

[Chorus]
""Walk this way, talk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, talk this way""
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school

Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter
Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter
Tryin'a get high off a quarter
I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker
Star, pop bottles, date top models
Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle
Where's the love though?
Nobody cares about that, where's the club? Where's the drugs though? Front row
Follow the flow, Megaupload
Feel the adrenaline rush, who's the mug though? I don't know

Now pass me a shot, and make it a double

It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle
No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle
I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game
Going insane, 150 in the slow lane
Getting ahead of myself
My God, already thinking how can I better myself
Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself?
My car's a rocket, and if I get too carried away, I wouldn't know when to stop it

Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity

154,Playing With The Boys,"[Verse 1]
I'd say it was the right time
To walk away
When dreaming takes you nowhere
It's time to play

Bodies working overtime
Your money don't matter
The time keeps ticking
When someone's on your mind
On your mind

I'm moving in slow motion
Feels so good
It's a strange anticipation
Knock, knock
Knocking on wood

Bodies working overtime
It's man against man
And all that ever matters is, baby
Who's ahead in the game
Funny
But it's always the same

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing with the boys
Staying
Playing with the boys

After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is playing with the boys

[Verse 2]
Said it was the wrong thing
For me to do
I said it's just a boys' game
But girls play too

My heart is working overtime
In this kind of game
People get hurt
I'm thinking that the people is me
If you wanna find me
I'll be

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing with the boys
Staying
Playing with the boys

After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
(Is the boys)

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be
The moth around your fire
(With the boys)
I don't wanna be
Obsessed by my desire
(You're shining, you're smiling, I'll see it now)
With the boys
(I'm staying here)
You play too rough

[Chorus:]
Playing
Playing with the boys
I'll be staying
Playing with the boys

After chasing sunsets
One of life's simple joys
Is playing with the boys
Playing with the boys

Playing
(Playing with the boys)

Get up, get up
Playing

Get up, get up

157,Love Is The Hero,"There is a course in life
So all the teachers say
It calls you day and night
It takes your thoughts away
Under a frozen light
You face a long crusade
Where there's a cause you fight
Where there's a cost you pay

Find an empty heart
You feel the passion play
It's when reactions start
That you can't look away
There is no wrong or right
There's just your point of view
But when you face the light
Then it will come to you

Love is the hero
Soldier forever
Life below zero
Never say never

There is no sacrifice
There is no dead-end street
There is no sound advice
Only the watch you keep
With every step you take
Through every room of fear
With every move you make
The song will pull you near

Turn you world around
And it will come your way
Through your cold-chill nights
And in your hard-earned days
When you face the light
It may be hard to do
But when it's all too right
Then it will come to you

Love is the hero
Soldier forever
Love is the hero
You live to remember

No path is too steep
No distance too wide
No question too deep
No force can divide
You fortune you seek
The road will unwind
You're comin' to me
To search is to find

And when you start to fall
Into that frozen space
And when you reach the wall
And there's no sunny place
And when it all comes down
You make it anyhow
Anyway

Than anything could dream
But you locked up everything
To where id never reach the key

And i thought you understood
But now its obvious theres no way
You ever could

But, Take me
Break me
And help me to carry on
I need you
To hold me
Until the break of dawn

Ive had some time to think
And i know
I need to leave this place
I need to feel you here
And i need to see your face
The past is nothing but a reminder
Of how blind love can be
But im moving on
And i know
It will kill me

Take me
Break me
And help me to carry on
I need you
To hold me
Until..
Until dawn comes
Until dawn comes

Is that you in the distance
Clothed in blue and waiting for me
I ask god for a sign
That somehow
This is not a dream
Convinced this is real, i embrace you
For what i hope could last for years
No more lies no more pain and no more tears
And no more tears!

Now Im
Taken
Im Broken

161,Love Always,"VERSE 1:
Ain’t it crazy how life go
How we stuck on this lifeboat
How we swimming and paddling, hoping that we can just get to the right note
Man this can get shit can get spiteful, so we turn to a bible or a rifle
Searching and praying for answers when we don’t even know where life go?
They told me to try a little tenderness
They said that what you give is what you get
But I don’t know if I believe that shit
Because you had my heart and then you dipped
You slidin off my friends list
You did that shit you meant it
Do not try to flip it
It’s wicked, it’s written in stone
Can’t take that shit back
Now I’m cryin all alone
You made my heart crack
I don’t even check my phone
No Purple Heart and no snaps
Feel like everywhere I go I can’t escape what happened
What’s happening?
Two times this week, I’ve seen you in my dreams
Don’t have a place to go where I can try to find peace or be me

HOOK:
Don’t be mistaken when you’re listening this song is not for you
(Just hold me, just hold me)
This is for me cause I believe that I can grieve my way to truth
(Just hold me, just hold me)
Maybe there’s a reason why we seem to suffer in our youth
(Just hold me, just hold me)
But I’m still dreaming of the feeling back when it was me and you
(Just hold me, just hold me)

VERSE 2:
I hope you know you hurt me
I hope you know I’m cryin
When you said you don’t deserve me
And pulled off in the night
And now my family’s gettin worried, say they see it in my eyes
Because I’m lonely and uncertain if I’m gonna be alright I tell em
A week ago I’m chillin just writing another song
About a girl I had a vision and dreamed her singing along
She was my world and then it all fell to the ground and I was wrong
Did I do this to myself? I had to call her on the phone yeah
Wondering what you gonna tell ya friends and ya family
How you fucked another dude
How you handle it?
Are you in pain when you flex on the gram and shit
Or does it break your heart when I’m not there with ya
Said you never knew how much you would care for me
Since the day I met you thought you’d be there for me
Being alone really never was rare for me
Being in love was something I was scared to be
Never forget the night when you was drivin away
New whip, new girl there was nothing that I could say
You were pleading, kinda cryin, couldn’t really read your brain
Feel like a bullet hit my lungs and the air was replaced with pain

HOOK:
Don’t be mistaken when you’re listening this song is not for you
(Just hold me, just hold me)
This is for me cause I believe that I can grieve my way to truth

(Just hold me, just hold me)
But I’m still dreaming of the feeling back when it was me and you
(Just hold me, just hold me)

VERSE 3:
Talkin to my pops, wish you were here right now
Wish you could hold me down and catch my tears right now
Because I’m lonely and I know that you could heal my frown
It’s true, it’s you
It’s been hard to open up since I lost you I lost trust
I was scared that I knew anyone could leave me in the dust
I’m not talking about you, I’m really talkin bout us
When it all falls down that’s when I need to look up but
I told her I love her and when I blow up imma bring her backstage
Now I’m stuck wondering why the fuck we can’t back to that day
But you gon remember what you did if this kid could ever catch fame
Cause you were the first girl I loved but you still made my damn heartbreak
Gave her everything I had, she was different from the last
Bought her roses by the bag, now they dyin in her lap
Had to say it in a rap, know I’ll never bring you back
Shoulda know from my past that nothing’s ever built to last

If you think I'll be your fool, you better think again
I know you love me, but it just ain't right
I'm sick and tired of fighting with you every night

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you don't wanna hurt me
But you're doing things I can't explain
Oh baby, why don't you leave me?
'Cause you know I'll never change

[Chorus]
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
But one day soon and it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about

I'll find a honey to take a chance
And roll that dice into my past
She'll cover me for a little while
And show me love ain't out of style

My heart's in the hands of fate
Oh God I ain't asking much
Just a woman that I can trust

I wanna love that's strong and real
I gotta know just how it feels
Somebody to share my life
To hold onto through the night

170,Rumors,"[Verse 1]
She's got some nice long hair
And you know that she's a bad chick
All the boys stare
Can't help it it's a habit
Clothes that she wears
Short skirt and a jacket
I just wanna get her all alone
On a mattress
I just wanna have it
I just gotta have it
Rumors all around say her body is fantastic
All natural, not a piece of her is plastic
Head to her toes yea they say that she's elastic
Yea the whispers all around say she has a reputation
Don't believe it 'till I see it so I want a demonstration
And I've always learned it better with a hands on education
So I need a private session if you get what I am saying
And they say that she's not easy no she's really complicated
But that only makes it better and it's got me so fixated
And I'm not the type to wait around I've never hesitated
But shes got me captivated so the game I'm gonna play it yea

[Chorus]
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
I want that body baby show me

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I heard you look good in a sundress
I heard you look good when you're undressed
I heard you like to get away
I heard you like to stay out late
I heard you had a couple boyfriends
I heard they didn't treat you right
I heard you're hated by your girlfriends
Cause all the guys want you tonight
They say she's too hot they say she's too cold
Where she came from nobody really knows
They say she looks young but say she acts old
From everything I've heard she gets out of control
And all the boys say she was sent from the heavens
But I'm not too sure that this girl is a blessing
She's got the devils eyes and they'll cut you like a weapon
She's stuck in my mind like a bad obsession
Got bad intentions

[Chorus]
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
She's got a body like a coke fiend

Love comes quickly whatever you do

You count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new heath insurance

So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster

'Cause yo this year, can't wait till he gets here
7/21/09 my first son will shine
And it's amazing, I'm about to be raising
Another made man and like his dad they'll praise him
And some will hate him just 'cause we're building a nation
Like Bob did with Damian, the world will embrace him
Girls will chase him, foresee they will not break him
And when I'm not around you look for God and thank him

Without the Hermes, you never hurting
You knew that you was destined for greatness for certain

You're keeping your composure like Gershwin
Songs by Earth, Wind, keep you in a zone writing verses
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose

We've got pre-school and day care
We've got pension and well-fare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings

I've got joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings

I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through his door
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after

I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off

Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything

If one day you just up and leave

Ye, just cleaning up the leaves
It's chilly out side, breezy

[Verse 1] (RayD)
Uh, last night I really started feeling right
Then I wondered how I'm gonna feel tomorrow night
I could be good if I start the morning right
And if it turns out good lets soar tonight
Ye, it's sorta nice having you here
But I wish I would have met you in the new year
Now it's the school year, and are you new here?
So nice to meet you, anything that I can do, dear?
So far, so good
You can check into my car or check under the hood
Now listen to my heart, I hope it's understood
I should take you anywhere and I would if I could but I can't
So I went to the bank, my salary sank and it stank
But I'm pushing up to be the top rank
I'm running this shit, cushion up Tom Hanks
They wanted me to Barnaby, I said 'Nah, thanks'
Happily forever is the way I like to think of it
Party all the time, I only ever drink a bit
I ain't that type, the girls just ask like
'Hey, do you have skype?'
I did last night
But it's a new day, I'll grab my schedule
I don't go to one class, I'm a rebel
Crank the treble and I'm in deep trouble
Instruments in a huddle
Drop the beat, it's a fumble

[Verse 2] (Roe)
Get me couple cups, pour a little bit of liquor
Only Coke and Ginger Ale, I can still down it quicker
Just to keep my satisfied, it'll be a little bitter
Throw it out my hand, then we can call it litter
Just to take the money out the pocket
Just buy another, cause right now I feel a little bit slicker
They say Roe can you roll a blunt, spit first
Roll one and smoke one, there's my first verse
They saying don't stop, they forgot about the blunt
Drink a little, smoke a little 'til you just got enough
So I say it's okay, it's cool, I guess I'm down with it
Can I get little more shots free now
Waiting, feel like I got a get a little shut out
Close my eyes and waiting next day to come out
So I lay back, eat snacks and just chill
Wake up the next day, live it up again
Yes, bet I will

[Hook]
There must be something going on tonight
We just living life
We don't care what they say
Gotta make it to the top
Please don't get in our way
And it's cold outside, but we should not hide
Baby, don't be shy

[Verse 3] (Roe)
It's cold outside but we don't really care
Cause all we do is chill, play games anywhere
And this life that we living, live it up to the best
Hide out at the spot, got no one to impress
Eating popcorn and chips, get another bag of munchies
Lay back and rest after rolling bag of zaggies
Keep on messing with their mind, they all know my grind
Time to live it up again, all one life at a time
And I love sleeping all day and all night
Not caring what I do next is just the life
Not caring what I drink, not caring foods right
[?] Kelsey's all day and all night
And everything come to me just like a take out
Breakfast in bed served when I just wake up
Birds chirp outside 'til I say 'Just chill out'
Haven't gotten up yet, but I guess I will now

I got sixteen left and a page full of lyrics
I wrote it like a letter so I thought I'd sincere it
The paper's sogging up from the ink and the tears
A poet rambles on is how you think it appears
From the sink to the mirrors, I'm taking double shots
And I'd be getting high but I'm in trouble with the cops
For the pot that I brought along, a bong and a pair of D's
I ain't smoking pops though, this is for Sarah B
It's always second similarities
I notice that the girl expects the love to be a parody
Before I make you laugh, you gotta show me clarity
You're looking like you're having lots of fun
I'm barely feeling all this
Typically how the Pharaoh be
But I'm fitting through this arrow very narrowly
Thoughts'll come out very terribly
But I'm proud to spit my rhymes cause I know that someones there for me

[Hook x2]
They got me smokin' weed cause the situation got me vexed
Never livin' to see what's next, funny how we flex
Critical situations, ain't nothing iller
Living in a world fulla killaz

[Main]
Bullet wounds can make the roughest nigga scream for momma
I wonder why we fiend for drama
The media continues to paint violent pictures
No longer untouchable let the motherfuckers get you
But god has a place for the devils
The false prophet fiending for collection
Disregarding his Resurrection
Let me holla at cha
Greaters see what's in me
I let my spirit tell it
How many missionaries worshiping the relic
But still I'm screaming maintain niggas
Coming up ain't a breeze
Think about your frail existence when you move in the keys
This could be the last caper
Time to holla at the reaper
Am I your brothers keeper
My brain stay twisted with homicides I have witnessed
Many were personal but the majority was business
Many onlookers don't realise what it means to see a man take his last breath before your eyes

[Hook x2]
They got me smokin' weed cause the situation got me vexed
Never livin' to see what's next, funny how we flex
Critical situations, ain't nothing iller
Living in a world fulla killaz

[Main]
Pull out some liquor for my niggas that was blown to pieces
Tragic is but that is what happens when the chrome releases
I hear them shots ringing in my head lord collect em
Forgive my homies for their sins let your glory protect em
How many niggas gonna die tonight we can't call it
We stay on ses plus we all alcoholics running
From the cops cos they killers and rapists
They be the main motherfuckers robbin niggas for papers
How many niggas doing 25 years or better
My baby mamas dropped the child support scared I might quit her
Some body tell me why wile out serial hits
And the motherfuckers lives over trivial shit
Hard times be provoking niggas to blast on site
Caught up in the hell and fury niggas blast all night
It's the beginning of the end we caught up in chambers
Using violence to express our anger

[Hook x2]
They got me smokin' weed cause the situation got me vexed
Never livin' to see what's next, funny how we flex
Critical situations, ain't nothing iller
Living in a world fulla killaz

(Gun Fire Exchange, police sirens)
How much weed can a motherfucker smoke fiending like a baser
Straight gin no chaser
Let me holla
Motherfuckers better recognise blessed to be
Try to diminish my image
Get the best of me
Young gs pack a fire
No remorse no love
Size em up if you want to
You be swallowing slugs
Seems everything occurring was probable and predicted
Poisonous play leave the drugs leaving masons addicted
Got me screaming don't get caught in the bullshit g
Can always pray for you but won't let them bullshit me
Look at how us young niggas stay caught up in prison
God was talking to my heart but my soul wouldn't listen
Hard lesson to be learned so much time was wasted
If a come up was available best believe I'd chase it
Born my legacy passed on to kids
God judging these people look at the things we did

Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You might say no to me
But to me a no is so indifferently
I drag along your way
It's your way I'm hanging in so desperately

[Pre-Chorus]
I beg you please to start believe that it's way too soon
To change your way

[Chorus]
You can feel that our love
Is fading out, out of touch (oh)
And you say we’ve got nothing in common
You're so crazy, I'm sane
You got heart, I got brains
And there's nothing that we have in common at all

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Nothing in common

And it hurts when you tell me how I'm supposed to be
You tell me to suit up, get a job
It makes you crazy that I cannot see

[Verse 1: Big L]
The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin' poems to have them faggots
Diggin' hoes like Reverend Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps 'til they head splits
Then break 'em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin' TEC's, because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex was in the projects layin' threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale
Satan said I'm learnin' well, Big L's gonna burn in Hell
Front and get scarred 'cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a heathen squad, and none of us believe in God

[Hook: McGruff + Big L]

(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

[Verse 2: Big L]
I got styles you can't copy, bitch
It's the triple six in the mix, straight from H-E-double-hockey sticks
Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up
They said a real man won't hit a girl
Well, I ain't real, 'cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price
I'm the type to snap in Heaven with a MAC-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, 'cause Hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit strictly
Little kids be wakin' up cryin'
Yellin', ""Mommy, Big L is comin' to get me!""

[Verse 3: Big L]
I keep a cutie with a soft booty
Hoes be runnin' up, ""Can I get your autograph, L?""
No, bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin' hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge, just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers, bitch – if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it 'cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold-slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Ayo, crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed

And it's a high time to fight when the walls are closing in
A-call it what you like, it's time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely, your spirit's sinking down
You find you're not the only stranger in this town

Red lights, green lights, stop and go jive
Headlines, deadlines jamming your mind
You been stealing shots from the side
Let your feelings go for a ride

There's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite, the boys are set to prowl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight? Do you wanna take it all?

Slowdown, showdown, waiting on line
Showtime, no time, changing your mind
Streets are ringing, march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down

Somebody's watching you, baby, so much you can do
Nobody's stopping you, baby, from making it too
One glimpse'll show you now, baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now, baby, it can happen to you

No more sleeping, wasting our time
Midnight creeping's first on our mind
No more lazing around the TV
You'll go crazy, come out with me

Say you're lonely?
Come out

And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On Our Lady of the Harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

214,"Walk Like A Man (From ""A Fine Mess"")","The Last Resolution


THAT MORNING MANY people saw Pyotr Stepanovitch. All who saw him remembered that he was in a particularly excited state. At two o'clock he went to see Gaganov, who had arrived from the country only the day before, and whose house was full of visitors hotly discussing the events of the previous day. Pyotr Stepanovitch talked more than anyone and made them listen to him. He was always considered among us as a ""chatterbox of a student with a screw loose,"" but now he talked of Yulia Mihailovna, and in the general excitement the theme was an enthralling one. As one who had recently been her intimate and confidential friend, he disclosed many new and unexpected details concerning her; incidentally (and of course unguardedly) he repeated some of her own remarks about persons known to all in the town, and thereby piqued their vanity. He dropped it all in a vague and rambling way, like a man free from guile driven by his sense of honour to the painful necessity of clearing up a perfect mountain of misunderstandings, and so simple-hearted that he hardly knew where to begin and where to leave off. He let slip in a rather unguarded way, too, that Yulia Mihailovna knew the whole secret of Stavrogin and that she had been at the bottom of the whole intrigue. She had taken him in too, for he, Pyotr Stepanovitch, had also been in love with this unhappy Liza, yet he had been so hoodwinked that he had almost taken her to Stavrogin himself in the carriage. ""Yes, yes, it's all very well for you to laugh, gentlemen, but if only I'd known, if I'd known how it would end!"" he concluded. To various excited inquiries about Stavrogin he bluntly replied that in his opinion the catastrophe to the Lebyadkins was a pure coincidence, and that it was all Lebyadkin's own fault for displaying his money. He explained this particularly well. One of his listeners observed that it was no good his ""pretending""; that he had eaten and drunk and almost slept at Yulia Mihailovna's, yet now he was the first to blacken her character, and that this was by no means such a fine thing to do as he supposed. But Pyotr Stepanovitch immediately defended himself.

""I ate and drank there not because I had no money, and it's not my fault that I was invited there. Allow me to judge for myself how far I need to be grateful for that.""

The general impression was in his favour. ""He may be rather absurd, and of course he is a nonsensical fellow, yet still he is not responsible for Yulia Mihailovna's foolishness. On the contrary, it appears that he tried to stop her.""

About two o'clock the news suddenly came that Stavrogin, about whom there was so much talk, had suddenly left for Petersburg by the midday train. This interested people immensely; many of them frowned. Pyotr Stepanovitch was so much struck that I was told he turned quite pale and cried out strangely, ""Why, how could they have let him go?"" He hurried away from Gaganov's forthwith, yet he was seen in two or three other houses.

Towards dusk he succeeded in getting in to see Yulia Mihailovna though he had the greatest pains to do so, as she had absolutely refused to see him. I heard of this from the lady herself only three weeks afterwards, just before her departure for Petersburg. She gave me no details, but observed with a shudder that ""he had on that occasion astounded her beyond all belief."" I imagine that all he did was to terrify her by threatening to charge her with being an accomplice if she ""said anything."" The necessity for this intimidation arose from his plans at the moment, of which she, of course, knew nothing; and only later, five days afterwards, she guessed why he had been so doubtful of her reticence and so afraid of a new outburst of indignation on her part.

Between seven and eight o'clock, when it was dark, all the five members of the quintet met together at Ensign Erkel's lodgings in a little crooked house at the end of the town. The meeting had been fixed by Pyotr Stepanovitch himself, but he was unpardonably late, and the members waited over an hour for him. This Ensign Erkel was that young officer who had sat the whole evening at Virginsky's with a pencil in his hand and a notebook before him. He had not long been in the town; he lodged alone with two old women, sisters, in a secluded by-street and was shortly to leave the town; a meeting at his house was less likely to attract notice than anywhere. This strange boy was distinguished by extreme taciturnity: he was capable of sitting for a dozen evenings in succession in noisy company, with the most extraordinary conversation going on around him, without uttering a word, though he listened with extreme attention, watching the speakers with his childlike eyes. His face was very pretty and even had a certain look of cleverness. He did not belong to the quintet; it was supposed that he had some special job of a purely practical character. It is known now that he had nothing of the sort and probably did not understand his position himself. It was simply that he was filled with hero-worship for Pyotr Stepanovitch, whom he had only lately met. If he had met a monster of iniquity who had incited him to found a band of brigands on the pretext of some romantic and socialistic object, and as a test had bidden him rob and murder the first peasant he met, he would certainly have obeyed and done it. He had an invalid mother to whom he sent half of his scanty pay—and how she must have kissed that poor little flaxen head, how she must have trembled and prayed over it! I go into these details about him because I feel very sorry for him.

""Our fellows"" were excited. The events of the previous night had made a great impression on them, and I fancy they were in a panic. The simple disorderliness in which they had so zealously and systematically taken part had ended in a way they had not expected. The fire in the night, the murder of the Lebyadkins, the savage brutality of the crowd with Liza, had been a series of surprises which they had not anticipated in their programme. They hotly accused the hand that had guided them of despotism and duplicity. In fact, while they were waiting for Pyotr Stepanovitch they worked each other up to such a point that they resolved again to ask him for a definite explanation, and if he evaded again, as he had done before, to dissolve the quintet and to found instead a new secret society ""for the propaganda of ideas"" and on their own initiative on the basis of democracy and equality. Liputin, Shigalov, and the authority on the peasantry supported this plan; Lyamshin said nothing, though he looked approving. Virginsky hesitated and wanted to hear Pyotr Stepanovitch first. It was decided to hear Pyotr Stepanovitch, but still he did not come; such casualness added fuel to the flames. Erkel was absolutely silent and did nothing but order the tea, which he brought from his landladies in glasses on a tray, not bringing in the samovar nor allowing the servant to enter.

Pyotr Stepanovitch did not turn up till half-past eight. With rapid steps he went up to the circular table before the sofa round which the company were seated; he kept his cap in his hand and refused tea. He looked angry, severe, and supercilious. He must have observed at once from their faces that they were ""mutinous.""

""Before I open my mouth, you've got something hidden; out with it.""

Liputin began ""in the name of all,"" and declared in a voice quivering with resentment ""that if things were going on like that they might as well blow their brains out."" Oh, they were not at all afraid to blow their brains out, they were quite ready to, in fact, but only to serve the common cause (a general movement of approbation). So he must be more open with them so that they might always know beforehand, ""or else what would things be coming to?"" (Again a stir and some guttural sounds.) To behave like this was humiliating and dangerous. ""We don't say so because we are afraid, but if one acts and the rest are only pawns, then one would blunder and all would be lost."" (Exclamations. ""Yes, yes."" General approval.)

""Damn it all, what do you want?""

""What connection is there between the common cause and the petty intrigues of Mr. Stavrogin?"" cried Liputin, boiling over. ""Suppose he is in some mysterious relation to the centre, if that legendary centre really exists at all, it's no concern of ours. And meantime a murder has been committed, the police have been roused; if they follow the thread they may find what it starts from.""

""If Stavrogin and you are caught, we shall be caught too,"" added the authority on the peasantry.

""And to no good purpose for the common cause,"" Virginsky concluded despondently.

""What nonsense! The murder is a chance crime; it was committed by Fedka for the sake of robbery.""

""H'm! Strange coincidence, though,"" said Liputin, wriggling.

""And if you will have it, it's all through you.""

""Through us?""

""In the first place, you, Liputin, had a share in the intrigue yourself; and the second chief point is, you were ordered to get Lebyadkin away and given money to do it; and what did you do? If you'd got him away nothing would have happened.""

""But wasn't it you yourself who suggested the idea that it would be a good thing to set him on to read his verses?""

""An idea is not a command. The command was to get him away.""

""Command! Rather a queer word.... On the contrary, your orders were to delay sending him off.""

""You made a mistake and showed your foolishness and self-will. The murder was the work of Fedka, and he carried it out alone for the sake of robbery. You heard the gossip and believed it. You were scared. Stavrogin is not such a fool, and the proof of that is he left the town at twelve o'clock after an interview with the vice-governor; if there were anything in it they would not let him go to Petersburg in broad daylight.""

""But we are not making out that Mr. Stavrogin committed the murder himself,"" Liputin rejoined spitefully and unceremoniously. ""He may have known nothing about it, like me; and you know very well that I knew nothing about it, though I am mixed up in it like mutton in a hash.""

""Whom are you accusing?"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, looking at him darkly.

""Those whose interest it is to burn down towns.""

""You make matters worse by wriggling out of it. However, won't you read this and pass it to the others, simply as a fact of interest?""

He pulled out of his pocket Lebyadkin's anonymous letter to Lembke and handed it to Liputin. The latter read it, was evidently surprised, and passed it thoughtfully to his neighbour; the letter quickly went the round.

""Is that really Lebyadkin's handwriting?"" observed Shigalov.

""It is,"" answered Liputin and Tolkatchenko (the authority on the peasantry).

""I simply brought it as a fact of interest and because I knew you were so sentimental over Lebyadkin,"" repeated Pyotr Stepanovitch, taking the letter back. ""So it turns out, gentlemen, that a stray Fedka relieves us quite by chance of a dangerous man. That's what chance does sometimes! It's instructive, isn't it?""

The members exchanged rapid glances.

""And now, gentlemen, it's my turn to ask questions,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, assuming an air of dignity. ""Let me know what business you had to set fire to the town without permission.""

""What's this! We, we set fire to the town? That is laying the blame on others!"" they exclaimed.

""I quite understand that you carried the game too far,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch persisted stubbornly, ""but it's not a matter of petty scandals with Yulia Mihailovna. I've brought you here gentlemen, to explain to you the greatness of the danger you have so stupidly incurred, which is a menace to much besides yourselves.""

""Excuse me, we, on the contrary, were intending just now to point out to you the greatness of the despotism and unfairness you have shown in taking such a serious and also strange step without consulting the members,"" Virginsky, who had been hitherto silent, protested, almost with indignation.

""And so you deny it? But I maintain that you set fire to the town, you and none but you. Gentlemen, don't tell lies! I have good evidence. By your rashness you exposed the common cause to danger. You are only one knot in an endless network of knots—and your duty is blind obedience to the centre. Yet three men of you incited the Shpigulin men to set fire to the town without the least instruction to do so, and the fire has taken place.""

""What three? What three of us?""

""The day before yesterday, at three o'clock in the night, you, Tolkatchenko, were inciting Fomka Zavyalov at the 'Forget-me-not.'""

""Upon my word!"" cried the latter, jumping up, ""I scarcely said a word to him, and what I did say was without intention, simply because he had been flogged that morning. And I dropped it at once; I saw he was too drunk. If you had not referred to it I should not have thought of it again. A word could not set the place on fire.""

""You are like a man who should be surprised that a tiny spark could blow a whole powder magazine into the air.""

""I spoke in a whisper in his ear, in a corner; how could you have heard of it?""

Tolkatchenko reflected suddenly.

""I was sitting there under the table. Don't disturb yourselves, gentlemen; I know every step you take. You smile sarcastically, Mr. Liputin? But I know, for instance, that you pinched your wife black and blue at midnight, three days ago, in your bedroom as you were going to bed.""

Liputin's mouth fell open and he turned pale. (It was afterwards found out that he knew of this exploit of Liputin's from Agafya, Liputin's servant, whom he had paid from the beginning to spy on him; this only came out later.)

""May I state a fact?"" said Shigalov, getting up.

""State it.""

Shigalov sat down and pulled himself together.

""So far as I understand—and it's impossible not to understand it—you yourself at first and a second time later, drew with great eloquence, but too theoretically, a picture of Russia covered with an endless network of knots. Each of these centres of activity, proselytising and ramifying endlessly, aims by systematic denunciation to injure the prestige of local authority, to reduce the villages to confusion, to spread cynicism and scandals, together with complete disbelief in everything and an eagerness for something better, and finally, by means of fires, as a pre-eminently national method, to reduce the country at a given moment, if need be, to desperation. Are those your words which I tried to remember accurately? Is that the programme you gave us as the authorised representative of the central committee, which is to this day utterly unknown to us and almost like a myth?""

""It's correct, only you are very tedious.""

""Every one has a right to express himself in his own way. Giving us to understand that the separate knots of the general network already covering Russia number by now several hundred, and propounding the theory that if every one does his work successfully, all Russia at a given moment, at a signal...""

""Ah, damn it all, I have enough to do without you!"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, twisting in his chair.

""Very well, I'll cut it short and I'll end simply by asking if we've seen the disorderly scenes, we've seen the discontent of the people, we've seen and taken part in the downfall of local administration, and finally, we've seen with our own eyes the town on fire? What do you find amiss? Isn't that your programme? What can you blame us for?""

""Acting on your own initiative!"" Pyotr Stepanovitch cried furiously. ""While I am here you ought not to have dared to act without my permission. Enough. We are on the eve of betrayal, and perhaps to-morrow or to-night you'll be seized. So there. I have authentic information.""

At this all were agape with astonishment.

""You will be arrested not only as the instigators of the fire, but as a quintet. The traitor knows the whole secret of the network. So you see what a mess you've made of it!""

""Stavrogin, no doubt,"" cried Liputin.

""What... why Stavrogin?"" Pyotr Stepanovitch seemed suddenly taken aback. ""Hang it all,"" he cried, pulling himself together at once, ""it's Shatov! I believe you all know now that Shatov in his time was one of the society. I must tell you that, watching him through persons he does not suspect, I found out to my amazement that he knows all about the organisation of the network and... everything, in fact. To save himself from being charged with having formerly belonged, he will give information against all. He has been hesitating up till now and I have spared him. Your fire has decided him: he is shaken and will hesitate no longer. To-morrow we shall be arrested as incendiaries and political offenders.""

""Is it true? How does Shatov know?"" The excitement was indescribable.

""It's all perfectly true. I have no right to reveal the source from which I learnt it or how I discovered it, but I tell you what I can do for you meanwhile: through one person I can act on Shatov so that without his suspecting it he will put off giving information, but not more than for twenty-four hours."" All were silent.

""We really must send him to the devil!"" Tolkatchenko was the first to exclaim.

""It ought to have been done long ago,"" Lyamshin put in malignantly, striking the table with his fist.

""But how is it to be done?"" muttered Liputin. Pyotr Stepanovitch at once took up the question and unfolded his plan. The plan was the following day at nightfall to draw Shatov away to a secluded spot to hand over the secret printing press which had been in his keeping and was buried there, and there ""to settle things."" He went into various essential details which we will omit here, and explained minutely Shatov's present ambiguous attitude to the central society, of which the reader knows already.

""That's all very well,"" Liputin observed irresolutely, ""but since it will be another adventure... of the same sort... it will make too great a sensation.""

""No doubt,"" assented Pyotr Stepanovitch, ""but I've provided against that. We have the means of averting suspicion completely.""

And with the same minuteness he told them about Kirillov, of his intention to shoot himself, and of his promise to wait for a signal from them and to leave a letter behind him taking on himself anything they dictated to him (all of which the reader knows already).

""His determination to take his own life—a philosophic, or as I should call it, insane decision—has become known there"" Pyotr Stepanovitch went on to explain. ""There not a thread, not a grain of dust is overlooked; everything is turned to the service of the cause. Foreseeing how useful it might be and satisfying themselves that his intention was quite serious, they had offered him the means to come to Russia (he was set for some reason on dying in Russia), gave him a commission which he promised to carry out (and he had done so), and had, moreover, bound him by a promise, as you already know, to commit suicide only when he was told to. He promised everything. You must note that he belongs to the organisation on a particular footing and is anxious to be of service; more than that I can't tell you. To-morrow, after Shatov's affair, I'll dictate a note to him saying that he is responsible for his death. That will seem very plausible: they were friends and travelled together to America, there they quarrelled; and it will all be explained in the letter... and... and perhaps, if it seems feasible, we might dictate something more to Kirillov—something about the manifestoes, for instance, and even perhaps about the fire. But I'll think about that. You needn't worry yourselves, he has no prejudices; he'll sign anything.""

There were expressions of doubt. It sounded a fantastic story. But they had all heard more or less about Kirillov; Liputin more than all.

""He may change his mind and not want to,"" said Shigalov; ""he is a madman anyway, so he is not much to build upon.""

""Don't be uneasy, gentlemen, he will want to,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch snapped out. ""I am obliged by our agreement to give him warning the day before, so it must be to-day. I invite Liputin to go with me at once to see him and make certain, and he will tell you, gentlemen, when he comes back—to-day if need be—whether what I say is true. However,"" he broke off suddenly with intense exasperation, as though he suddenly felt he was doing people like them too much honour by wasting time in persuading them, ""however, do as you please. If you don't decide to do it, the union is broken up—but solely through your insubordination and treachery. In that case we are all independent from this moment. But under those circumstances, besides the unpleasantness of Shatov's betrayal and its consequences, you will have brought upon yourselves another little unpleasantness of which you were definitely warned when the union was formed. As far as I am concerned, I am not much afraid of you, gentlemen.... Don't imagine that I am so involved with you.... But that's no matter.""

""Yes, we decide to do it,"" Liputin pronounced.

""There's no other way out of it,"" muttered Tolkatchenko, ""and if only Liputin confirms about Kirillov, then...

""I am against it; with all my soul and strength I protest against such a murderous decision,"" said Virginsky, standing up.

""But?"" asked Pyotr Stepanovitch....

""But what?""

""You said but... and I am waiting.""

""I don't think I did say but... I only meant to say that if you decide to do it, then...""

""Then?""

Virginsky did not answer.

""I think that one is at liberty to neglect danger to one's own life,"" said Erkel, suddenly opening his mouth, ""but if it may injure the cause, then I consider one ought not to dare to neglect danger to one's life....""

He broke off in confusion, blushing. Absorbed as they all were in their own ideas, they all looked at him in amazement—it was such a surprise that he too could speak.

""I am for the cause,"" Virginsky pronounced suddenly.

Every one got up. It was decided to communicate once more and make final arrangements at midday on the morrow, though without meeting. The place where the printing press was hidden was announced and each was assigned his part and his duty. Liputin and Pyotr Stepanovitch promptly set off together to Kirillov.

           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbspII

All our fellows believed that Shatov was going to betray them; but they also believed that Pyotr Stepanovitch was playing with them like pawns. And yet they knew, too, that in any case they would all meet on the spot next day and that Shatov's fate was sealed. They suddenly felt like flies caught in a web by a huge spider; they were furious, but they were trembling with terror.

Pyotr Stepanovitch, of course, had treated them badly; it might all have gone off far more harmoniously and easily if he had taken the trouble to embellish the facts ever so little. Instead of putting the facts in a decorous light, as an exploit worthy of ancient Rome or something of the sort, he simply appealed to their animal fears and laid stress on the danger to their own skins, which was simply insulting; of course there was a struggle for existence in everything and there was no other principle in nature, they all knew that, but still....

But Pyotr Stepanovitch had no time to trot out the Romans; he was completely thrown out of his reckoning. Stavrogin's flight had astounded and crushed him. It was a lie when he said that Stavrogin had seen the vice-governor; what worried Pyotr Stepanovitch was that Stavrogin had gone off without seeing anyone, even his mother—and it was certainly strange that he had been allowed to leave without hindrance. (The authorities were called to account for it afterwards.) Pyotr Stepanovitch had been making inquiries all day, but so far had found out nothing, and he had never been so upset. And how could he, how could he give up Stavrogin all at once like this! That was why he could not be very tender with the quintet. Besides, they tied his hands: he had already decided to gallop after Stavrogin at once; and meanwhile he was detained by Shatov; he had to cement the quintet together once for all, in case of emergency. ""Pity to waste them, they might be of use."" That, I imagine, was his way of reasoning.

As for Shatov, Pyotr Stepanovitch was firmly convinced that he would betray them. All that he had told the others about it was a lie: he had never seen the document nor heard of it, but he thought it as certain as that twice two makes four. It seemed to him that what had happened—the death of Liza, the death of Marya Timofyevna—would be too much for Shatov, and that he would make up his mind at once. Who knows? perhaps he had grounds for supposing it. It is known, too, that he hated Shatov personally; there had at some time been a quarrel between them, and Pyotr Stepanovitch never forgave an offence. I am convinced, indeed, that this was his leading motive.

We have narrow brick pavements in our town, and in some streets only raised wooden planks instead of a pavement. Pyotr Stepanovitch walked in the middle of the pavement, taking up the whole of it, utterly regardless of Liputin, who had no room to walk beside him and so had to hurry a step behind or run in the muddy road if he wanted to speak to him. Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly remembered how he had lately splashed through the mud to keep pace with Stavrogin, who had walked, as he was doing now, taking up the whole pavement. He recalled the whole scene, and rage choked him.

But Liputin, too, was choking with resentment. Pyotr Stepanovitch might treat the others as he liked, but him! Why, he knew more than all the rest, was in closer touch with the work and taking more intimate part in it than anyone, and hitherto his services had been continual, though indirect. Oh, he knew that even now Pyotr Stepanovitch might ruin him if it came to the worst. But he had long hated Pyotr Stepanovitch, and not because he was a danger but because of his overbearing manner. Now, when he had to make up his mind to such a deed, he raged inwardly more than all the rest put together. Alas! he knew that next day ""like a slave"" he would be the first on the spot and would bring the others, and if he could somehow have murdered Pyotr Stepanovitch before the morrow, without ruining himself, of course, he would certainly have murdered him.

Absorbed in his sensations, he trudged dejectedly after his tormentor, who seemed to have forgotten his existence, though he gave him a rude and careless shove with his elbow now and then. Suddenly Pyotr Stepanovitch halted in one of the principal thoroughfares and went into a restaurant.

""What are you doing?"" cried Liputin, boiling over. ""This is a restaurant.""

""I want a beefsteak.""

""Upon my word! It is always full of people.""

""What if it is?""

""But... we shall be late. It's ten o'clock already.""

""You can't be too late to go there.""

""But I shall be late! They are expecting me back.""

""Well, let them; but it would be stupid of you to go to them. With all your bobbery I've had no dinner. And the later you go to Kirillov's the more sure you are to find him.""

Pyotr Stepanovitch went to a room apart. Liputin sat in an easy chair on one side, angry and resentful, and watched him eating. Half an hour and more passed. Pyotr Stepanovitch did not hurry himself; he ate with relish, rang the bell, asked for a different kind of mustard, then for beer, without saying a word to Liputin. He was pondering deeply. He was capable of doing two things at once—eating with relish and pondering deeply. Liputin loathed him so intensely at last that he could not tear himself away. It was like a nervous obsession. He counted every morsel of beefsteak that Pyotr Stepanovitch put into his mouth; he loathed him for the way he opened it, for the way he chewed, for the way he smacked his lips over the fat morsels, he loathed the steak itself. At last things began to swim before his eyes; he began to feel slightly giddy; he felt hot and cold run down his spine by turns.

""You are doing nothing; read that,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch suddenly, throwing him a sheet of paper. Liputin went nearer to the candle. The paper was closely covered with bad handwriting, with corrections in every line. By the time he had mastered it Pyotr Stepanovitch had paid his bill and was ready to go. When they were on the pavement Liputin handed him back the paper.

""Keep it; I'll tell you afterwards.... What do you say to it, though?""

Liputin shuddered all over.

""In my opinion... such a manifesto... is nothing but a ridiculous absurdity.""

His anger broke out; he felt as though he were being caught up and carried along.

""If we decide to distribute such manifestoes,"" he said, quivering all over, ""we'll make ourselves, contemptible by our stupidity and incompetence.""

""H'm! I think differently,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, walking on resolutely.

""So do I; surely it isn't your work?""

""That's not your business.""

""I think too that doggerel, 'A Noble Personality,' is the most utter trash possible, and it couldn't have been written by Herzen.""

""You are talking nonsense; it's a good poem.""

""I am surprised, too, for instance,"" said Liputin, still dashing along with desperate leaps, ""that it is suggested that we should act so as to bring everything to the ground. It's natural in Europe to wish to destroy everything because there's a proletariat there, but we are only amateurs here and in my opinion are only showing off.""

""I thought you were a Fourierist.""

""Fourier says something quite different, quite different.""

""I know it's nonsense.""

""No, Fourier isn't nonsense.... Excuse me, I can't believe that there will be a rising in May.""

Liputin positively unbuttoned his coat, he was so hot.

""Well, that's enough; but now, that I mayn't forget it,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, passing with extraordinary coolness to another subject, ""you will have to print this manifesto with your own hands. We're going to dig up Shatov's printing press, and you will take it to-morrow. As quickly as possible you must print as many copies as you can, and then distribute them all the winter. The means will be provided. You must do as many copies as possible, for you'll be asked for them from other places.""

""No, excuse me; I can't undertake such a... I decline.""

""You'll take it all the same. I am acting on the instructions of the central committee, and you are bound to obey.""

""And I consider that our centres abroad have forgotten what Russia is like and have lost all touch, and that's why they talk such nonsense.... I even think that instead of many hundreds of quintets in Russia, we are the only one that exists, and there is no network at all,"" Liputin gasped finally.

""The more contemptible of you, then, to run after the cause without believing in it... and you are running after me now like a mean little cur.""

""No, I'm not. We have a full right to break off and found a new society.""

""Fool!"" Pyotr Stepanovitch boomed at him threateningly all of a sudden, with flashing eyes.

They stood facing one another for some time. Pyotr Stepanovitch turned and pursued his way confidently.

The idea flashed through Liputin's mind, ""Turn and go back; if I don't turn now I shall never go back."" He pondered this for ten steps, but at the eleventh a new and desperate idea flashed into his mind: he did not turn and did not go back.

They were approaching Filipov's house, but before reaching it they turned down a side street, or, to be more accurate, an inconspicuous path under a fence, so that for some time they had to walk along a steep slope above a ditch where they could not keep their footing without holding the fence. At a dark corner in the slanting fence Pyotr Stepanovitch took out a plank, leaving a gap, through which he promptly scrambled. Liputin was surprised, but he crawled through after him; then they replaced the plank after them. This was the secret way by which Fedka used to visit Kirillov.

""Shatov mustn't know that we are here,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch whispered sternly to Liputin.

           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbspIII

Kirillov was sitting on his leather sofa drinking tea, as he always was at that hour. He did not get up to meet them, but gave a sort of start and looked at the new-comers anxiously.

""You are not mistaken,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, ""it's just that I've come about.""

""To-day?""

""No, no, to-morrow... about this time."" And he hurriedly sat down at the table, watching Kirillov's agitation with some uneasiness. But the latter had already regained his composure and looked as usual.

""These people still refuse to believe in you. You are not vexed at my bringing Liputin?""

""To-day I am not vexed; to-morrow I want to be alone.""

""But not before I come, and therefore in my presence.""

""I should prefer not in your presence.""

""You remember you promised to write and to sign all I dictated.""

""I don't care. And now will you be here long?""

""I have to see one man and to remain half an hour, so whatever you say I shall stay that half-hour.""

Kirillov did not speak. Liputin meanwhile sat down on one side under the portrait of the bishop. That last desperate idea gained more and more possession of him. Kirillov scarcely noticed him. Liputin had heard of Kirillov's theory before and always laughed at him; but now he was silent and looked gloomily round him.

""I've no objection to some tea,"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, moving up. ""I've just had some steak and was reckoning on getting tea with you.""

""Drink it. You can have some if you like.""

""You used to offer it to me,"" observed Pyotr Stepanovitch sourly.

""That's no matter. Let Liputin have some too.""

""No, I... can't.""

""Don't want to or can't?"" said Pyotr Stepanovitch, turning quickly to him.

""I am not going to here,"" Liputin said expressively.

Pyotr Stepanovitch frowned.

""There's a flavour of mysticism about that; goodness knows what to make of you people!""

No one answered; there was a full minute of silence.

""But I know one thing,"" he added abruptly, ""that no superstition will prevent any one of us from doing his duty.""

""Has Stavrogin gone?"" asked Kirillov.

""Yes.""

""He's done well.""

Pyotr Stepanovitch's eyes gleamed, but he restrained himself.

""I don't care what you think as long as every one keeps his word.""

""I'll keep my word.""

""I always knew that you would do your duty like an independent and progressive man.""

""You are an absurd fellow.""

""That may be; I am very glad to amuse you. I am always glad if I can give people pleasure.""

""You are very anxious I should shoot myself and are afraid I might suddenly not?""

""Well, you see, it was your own doing—connecting your plan with our work. Reckoning on your plan we have already done something, so that you couldn't refuse now because you've let us in for it.""

""You've no claim at all.""

""I understand, I understand; you are perfectly free, and we don't come in so long as your free intention is carried out.""

""And am I to take on myself all the nasty things you've done?""

""Listen, Kirillov, are you afraid? If you want to cry off, say so at once.""

""I am not afraid.""

""I ask because you are making so many inquiries.""

""Are you going soon?""

""Asking questions again?""

Kirillov scanned him contemptuously.

""You see,"" Pyotr Stepanovitch went on, getting angrier and angrier, and unable to take the right tone, ""you want me to go away, to be alone, to concentrate yourself, but all that's a bad sign for you—for you above all. You want to think a great deal. To my mind you'd better not think. And really you make me uneasy.""

""There's only one thing I hate, that at such a moment I should have a reptile like you beside me.""

""Oh, that doesn't matter. I'll go away at the time and stand on the steps if you like. If you are so concerned about trifles when it comes to dying, then... it's all a very bad sign. I'll go out on to the steps and you can imagine I know nothing about it, and that I am a man infinitely below you.""

""No, not infinitely; you've got abilities, but there's a lot you don't understand because you are a low man.""

""Delighted, delighted. I told you already I am delighted to provide entertainment... at such a moment.""

""You don't understand anything.""

""That is, I... well, I listen with respect, anyway.""

""You can do nothing; even now you can't hide your petty spite, though it's not to your interest to show it. You'll make me cross, and then I may want another six months."" Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at his watch. ""I never understood your theory, but I know you didn't invent it for our sakes, so I suppose you would carry it out apart from us. And I know too that you haven't mastered the idea but the idea has mastered you, so you won't put it off.""

""What? The idea has mastered me?""

""Yes.""

""And not I mastered the idea? That's good. You have a little sense. Only you tease me and I am proud.""

""That's a good thing, that's a good thing. Just what you need, to be proud.""

""Enough. You've drunk your tea; go away.""

""Damn it all, I suppose I must""—Pyotr Stepanovitch got up—""though it's early. Listen, Kirillov. Shall I find that man—you know whom I mean—at Myasnitchiha's? Or has she too been lying?""

""You won't find him, because he is here and not there.""

""Here! Damn it all, where?""

""Sitting in the kitchen, eating and drinking.""

""How dared he?"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, flushing angrily. ""It was his duty to wait... what nonsense! He has no passport, no money!""

""I don't know. He came to say good-bye; he is dressed and ready. He is going away and won't come back. He says you are a scoundrel and he doesn't want to wait for your money.""

""Ha ha! He is afraid that I'll... But even now I can... if... Where is he, in the kitchen?""

Kirillov opened a side door into a tiny dark room; from this room three steps led straight to the part of the kitchen where the cook's bed was usually put, behind the partition. Here, in the corner under the ikons, Fedka was sitting now, at a bare deal table. Before him stood a pint bottle, a plate of bread, and some cold beef and potatoes on an earthenware dish. He was eating in a leisurely way and was already half drunk, but he was wearing his sheep-skin coat and was evidently ready for a journey. A samovar was boiling the other side of the screen, but it was not for Fedka, who had every night for a week or more zealously blown it up and got it ready for ""Alexey Nilitch, for he's such a habit of drinking tea at nights."" I am strongly disposed to believe that, as Kirillov had not a cook, he had cooked the beef and potatoes that morning with his own hands for Fedka.

""What notion is this?"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch, whisking into the room. ""Why didn't you wait where you were ordered?""

And swinging his fist, he brought it down heavily on the table.

Fedka assumed an air of dignity.

""You wait a bit, Pyotr Stepanovitch, you wait a bit,"" he began, with a swaggering emphasis on each word, ""it's your first duty to understand here that you are on a polite visit to Mr. Kirillov, Alexey Nilitch, whose boots you might clean any day, because beside you he is a man of culture and you are only—foo!""

And he made a jaunty show of spitting to one side. Haughtiness and determination were evident in his manner, and a certain very threatening assumption of argumentative calm that suggested an outburst to follow. But Pyotr Stepanovitch had no time to realise the danger, and it did not fit in with his preconceived ideas. The incidents and disasters of the day had quite turned his head. Liputin, at the top of the three steps, stared inquisitively down from the little dark room.

""Do you or don't you want a trustworthy passport and good money to go where you've been told? Yes or no?""

""D'you see, Pyotr Stepanovitch, you've been deceiving me from the first, and so you've been a regular scoundrel to me. For all the world like a filthy human louse—that's how I look on you. You've promised me a lot of money for shedding innocent blood and swore it was for Mr. Stavrogin, though it turns out to be nothing but your want of breeding. I didn't get a farthing out of it, let alone fifteen hundred, and Mr. Stavrogin hit you in the face, which has come to our ears. Now you are threatening me again and promising me money—what for, you don't say. And I shouldn't wonder if you are sending me to Petersburg to plot some revenge in your spite against Mr. Stavrogin, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, reckoning on my simplicity. And that proves you are the chief murderer. And do you know what you deserve for the very fact that in the depravity of your heart you've given up believing in God Himself, the true Creator? You are no better than an idolater and are on a level with the Tatar and the Mordva. Alexey Nilitch, who is a philosopher, has expounded the true God, the Creator, many a time to you, as well as the creation of the world and the fate that's to come and the transformation of every sort of creature and every sort of beast out of the Apocalypse, but you've persisted like a senseless idol in your deafness and your dumbness and have brought Ensign Erkel to the same, like the veriest evil seducer and so-called atheist....""

""Ah, you drunken dog! He strips the ikons of their setting and then preaches about God!""

""D'you see, Pyotr Stepanovitch, I tell you truly that I have stripped the ikons, but I only took out the pearls; and how do you know? Perhaps my own tear was transformed into a pearl in the furnace of the Most High to make up for my sufferings, seeing I am just that very orphan, having no daily refuge. Do you know from the books that once, in ancient times, a merchant with just such tearful sighs and prayers stole a pearl from the halo of the Mother of God, and afterwards, in the face of all the people, laid the whole price of it at her feet, and the Holy Mother sheltered him with her mantle before all the people, so that it was a miracle, and the command was given through the authorities to write it all down word for word in the Imperial books. And you let a mouse in, so you insulted the very throne of God. And if you were not my natural master, whom I dandled in my arms when I was a stripling, I would have done for you now, without budging from this place!""

Pyotr Stepanovitch flew into a violent rage.

""Tell me, have you seen Stavrogin to-day?""

""Don't you dare to question me. Mr. Stavrogin is fairly amazed at you, and he had no share in it even in wish, let alone instructions or giving money. You've presumed with me.""

""You'll get the money and you'll get another two thousand in Petersburg, when you get there, in a lump sum, and you'll get more.""

""You are lying, my fine gentleman, and it makes me laugh to see how easily you are taken in. Mr. Stavrogin stands at the top of the ladder above you, and you yelp at him from below like a silly puppy dog, while he thinks it would be doing you an honour to spit at you.""

""But do you know,"" cried Pyotr Stepanovitch in a rage, ""that I won't let you stir a step from here, you scoundrel, and I'll hand you straight over to the police.""

Fedka leapt on to his feet and his eyes gleamed with fury. Pyotr Stepanovitch pulled out his revolver. Then followed a rapid and revolting scene: before Pyotr Stepanovitch could take aim, Fedka swung round and in a flash struck him on the cheek with all his might. Then there was the thud of a second blow, a third, then a fourth, all on the cheek. Pyotr Stepanovitch was dazed; with his eyes starting out of his head, he muttered something, and suddenly crashed full length to the ground.

""There you are; take him,"" shouted Fedka with a triumphant swagger; he instantly took up his cap, his bag from under the bench, and was gone. Pyotr Stepanovitch lay gasping and unconscious. Liputin even imagined that he had been murdered. Kirillov ran headlong into the kitchen.

""Water!"" he cried, and ladling some water in an iron dipper from a bucket, he poured it over the injured man's head. Pyotr Stepanovitch stirred, raised his head, sat up, and looked blankly about him.

""Well, how are you?"" asked Kirillov. Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at him intently, still not recognising him; but seeing Liputin peeping in from the kitchen, he smiled his hateful smile and suddenly got up, picking up his revolver from the floor.

""If you take it into your head to run away to-morrow like that scoundrel Stavrogin,"" he cried, pouncing furiously on Kirillov, pale, stammering, and hardly able to articulate his words, ""I'll hang you... like a fly... or crush you... if it's at the other end of the world... do you understand!""

And he held the revolver straight at Kirillov's head; but almost at the same minute, coming completely to himself, he drew back his hand, thrust the revolver into his pocket, and without saying another word ran out of the house. Liputin followed him. They clambered through the same gap and again walked along the slope holding to the fence. Pyotr Stepanovitch strode rapidly down the street so that Liputin could scarcely keep up with him. At the first crossing he suddenly stopped.

""Well?"" He turned to Liputin with a challenge.

Liputin remembered the revolver and was still trembling all over after the scene he had witnessed; but the answer seemed to come of itself irresistibly from his tongue:

""I think... I think that...""

""Did you see what Fedka was drinking in the kitchen?""

""What he was drinking? He was drinking vodka.""

""Well then, let me tell you it's the last time in his life he will drink vodka. I recommend you to remember that and reflect on it. And now go to hell; you are not wanted till to-morrow. But mind now, don't be a fool!""

Liputin rushed home full speed.

           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbsp           &nbspIV

He had long had a passport in readiness made out in a false name. It seems a wild idea that this prudent little man, the petty despot of his family, who was, above all things, a sharp man of business and a capitalist, and who was an official too (though he was a Fourierist), should long before have conceived the fantastic project of procuring this passport in case of emergency, that he might escape abroad by means of it if... he did admit the possibility of this if, though no doubt he was never able himself to formulate what this if might mean.

But now it suddenly formulated itself, and in a most unexpected way. That desperate idea with which he had gone to Kirillov's after that ""fool"" he had heard from Pyotr Stepanovitch on the pavement, had been to abandon everything at dawn next day and to emigrate abroad. If anyone doubts that such fantastic incidents occur in everyday Russian life, even now, let him look into the biographies of all the Russian exiles abroad. Not one of them escaped with more wisdom or real justification. It has always been the unrestrained domination of phantoms and nothing more.

Running home, he began by locking himself in, getting out his travelling bag, and feverishly beginning to pack. His chief anxiety was the question of money, and how much he could rescue from the impending ruin—and by what means. He thought of it as ""rescuing,"" for it seemed to him that he could not linger an hour, and that by daylight he must be on the high road. He did not know where to take the train either; he vaguely determined to take it at the second or third big station from the town, and to make his way there on foot, if necessary. In that way, instinctively and mechanically he busied himself in his packing with a perfect whirl of ideas in his head—and suddenly stopped short, gave it all up, and with a deep groan stretched himself on the sofa.

He felt clearly, and suddenly realised that he might escape, but that he was by now utterly incapable of deciding whether he ought to make off before or after Shatov's death; that he was simply a lifeless body, a crude inert mass; that he was being moved by an awful outside power; and that, though he had a passport to go abroad, that though he could run away from Shatov (otherwise what need was there of such haste?), yet he would run away, not from Shatov, not before his murder, but after it, and that that was determined, signed, and sealed.

In insufferable distress, trembling every instant and wondering at himself, alternately groaning aloud and numb with terror, he managed to exist till eleven o'clock next morning locked in and lying on the sofa; then came the shock he was awaiting, and it at once determined him. When he unlocked his door and went out to his household at eleven o'clock they told him that the runaway convict and brigand, Fedka, who was a terror to every one, who had pillaged churches and only lately been guilty of murder and arson, who was being pursued and could not be captured by our police, had been found at daybreak murdered, five miles from the town, at a turning off the high road, and that the whole town was talking of it already. He rushed headlong out of the house at once to find out further details, and learned, to begin with, that Fedka, who had been found with his skull broken, had apparently been robbed and, secondly, that the police already had strong suspicion and even good grounds for believing that the murderer was one of the Shpigulin men called Fomka, the very one who had been his accomplice in murdering the Lebyadkins and setting fire to their house, and that there had been a quarrel between them on the road about a large sum of money stolen from Lebyadkin, which Fedka was supposed to have hidden. Liputin ran to Pyotr Stepanovitch's lodgings and succeeded in learning at the back door, on the sly, that though Pyotr Stepanovitch had not returned home till about one o'clock at night, he had slept there quietly all night till eight o'clock next morning. Of course, there could be no doubt that there was nothing extraordinary about Fedka's death, and that such careers usually have such an ending; but the coincidence of the fatal words that ""it was the last time Fedka would drink vodka,"" with the prompt fulfilment of the prediction, was so remarkable that Liputin no longer hesitated. The shock had been given; it was as though a stone had fallen upon him and crushed him for ever. Returning home, he thrust his travelling-bag under the bed without a word, and in the evening at the hour fixed he was the first to appear at the appointed spot to meet Shatov, though it's true he still had his passport in his pocket.",Fyodor Dostoevsky,1986,"[95, 88, 75, 49, 41, 45, 47, 53, 62, 74]",10

   That day, as for some days past, Saint-Loup had been obliged to go to Doncières, where, until his leave finally expired, he would be on duty now until late every afternoon. I was sorry that he was not at Balbec. I had seen alight from carriages and pass, some into the ball-room of the Casino, others into the ice-cream shop, young women who at a distance had seemed to me lovely. I was passing through one of those periods of our youth, unprovided with any one definite love, vacant, in which at all times and in all places — as a lover the woman by whose charms he is smitten — we desire, we seek, we see Beauty. Let but a single real feature — the little that one distinguishes of a woman seen from afar or from behind — enable us to project the form of beauty before our eyes, we imagine that we have seen her before, our heart beats, we hasten in pursuit, and will always remain half-persuaded that it was she, provided that the woman has vanished: it is only if we manage to overtake her that we realise our mistake

   Besides, as I grew more and more delicate, I was inclined to overrate the simplest pleasures because of the difficulties that sprang up in the way of my attaining them. Charming women I seemed to see all round me, because I was too tired, if it was on the beach, too shy if it was in the Casino or at a pastry-cook’s, to go anywhere near them. And yet if I was soon to die I should have liked first to know the appearance at close quarters, in reality of the prettiest girls that life had to offer, even although it should be another than myself or no one at all who was to take advantage of the offer. (I did not, in fact, appreciate the desire for possession that underlay my curiosity.) I should have had the courage to enter the ballroom if Saint-Loup had been with me. Left by myself, I was simply hanging about in front of the Grand Hotel until it was time for me to join my grandmother, when, still almost at the far end of the paved ‘front’ along which they projected in a discordant spot of colour, I saw coming towards me five or six young girls, as different in appearance and manner from all the people whom one was accustomed to see at Balbec as could have been, landed there none knew whence, a flight of gulls which performed with measured steps upon the sands — the dawdlers using their wings to overtake the rest — a movement the purpose of which seems as obscure to the human bathers, whom they do not appear to see, as it is clearly determined in their own birdish minds

   One of these strangers was pushing as she came, with one hand, her bicycle; two others carried golf-clubs; and their attire generally was in contrast to that of the other girls at Balbec, some of whom, it was true, went in for games, but without adopting any special outfit

   It was the hour at which ladies and gentlemen came out every day for a turn on the ‘front,’ exposed to the merciless fire of the long glasses fastened upon them, as if they had each borne some disfigurement which she felt it her duty to inspect in its minutest details, by the chief magistrate’s wife, proudly seated there with her back to the band-stand, in the middle of that dread line of chairs on which presently they too, actors turned critics, would come and establish themselves, to scrutinise in their turn those others who would then be filing past them. All these people who paced up and down the ‘front,’ tacking as violently as if it had been the deck of a ship (for they could not lift a leg without at the same time waving their arms, turning their heads and eyes, settling their shoulders, compensating by a balancing movement on one side for the movement they had just made on the other, and puffing out their faces), and who, pretending not to see so as to let it be thought that they were not interested, but covertly watching, for fear of running against the people who were walking beside or coming towards them, did, in fact, butt into them, became entangled with them, because each was mutually the object of the same secret attention veiled beneath the same apparent disdain; their love — and consequently their fear — of the crowd being one of the most powerful motives in all men, whether they seek to please other people or to astonish them, or to shew them that they despise them. In the case of the solitary, his seclusion, even when it is absolute and ends only with life itself, has often as its primary cause a disordered love of the crowd, which so far overrules every other feeling that, not being able to win, when he goes out, the admiration of his hall-porter, of the passers-by, of the cabman whom he hails, he prefers not to be seen by them at all, and with that object abandons every activity that would oblige him to go out of doors

   Among all these people, some of whom were pursuing a train of thought, but if so betrayed its instability by spasmodic gestures, a roving gaze as little in keeping as the circumspect titubation of their neighbours, the girls whom I had noticed, with that mastery over their limbs which comes from perfect bodily condition and a sincere contempt for the rest of humanity, were advancing straight ahead, without hesitation or stiffness, performing exactly the movements that they wished to perform, each of their members in full independence of all the rest, the greater part of their bodies preserving that immobility which is so noticeable in a good waltzer. They were now quite near me. Although each was a type absolutely different from the others, they all had beauty; but to tell the truth I had seen them for so short a time, and without venturing to look them straight in the face, that I had not yet individualised any of them. Save one, whom her straight nose, her dark complexion pointed in contrast among the rest, like (in a renaissance picture of the Epiphany) a king of Arab cast, they were known to me only, one by a pair of eyes, hard, set and mocking; another by cheeks in which the pink had that coppery tint which makes one think of geraniums; and even of these points I had not yet indissolubly attached any one to one of these girls rather than to another; and when (according to the order in which their series met the eye, marvellous because the most different aspects came next one another, because all scales of colours were combined in it, but confused as a piece of music in which I should not have been able to isolate and identify at the moment of their passage the successive phrases, no sooner distinguished than forgotten) I saw emerge a pallid oval, black eyes, green eyes, I knew not if these were the same that had already charmed me a moment ago, I could not bring them home to any one girl whom I might thereby have set apart from the rest and so identified. And this want, in my vision, of the demarcations which I should presently establish between them sent flooding over the group a wave of harmony, the continuous transfusion of a beauty fluid, collective and mobile

   It was not perhaps, in this life of ours, mere chance that had, in forming this group of friends, chosen them all of such beauty; perhaps these girls (whose attitude was enough to reveal their nature, bold, frivolous and hard), extremely sensitive to everything that was ludicrous or ugly, incapable of yielding to an intellectual or moral attraction, had naturally felt themselves, among companions of their own age, repelled by all those in whom a pensive or sensitive disposition was betrayed by shyness, awkwardness, constraint, by what, they would say,‘didn’t appeal’ to them, and from such had held aloof; while they attached themselves, on the other hand, to others to whom they were drawn by a certain blend of grace, suppleness, and physical neatness, the only form in which they were able to picture the frankness of a seductive character and the promise of pleasant hours in one another’s company. Perhaps, too, the class to which they belonged, a class which I should not have found it easy to define, was at that point in its evolution at which, whether thanks to its growing wealth and leisure, or thanks to new athletic habits, extended now even to certain plebeian elements, and a habit of physical culture to which had not yet been added the culture of the mind, a social atmosphere, comparable to that of smooth and prolific schools of sculpture, which have not yet gone in for tortured expressions, produces naturally and in abundance fine bodies with fine legs, fine hips, wholesome and reposeful faces, with an air of agility and guile. And were they not noble and calm models of human beauty that I beheld there, outlined against the sea, like statues exposed to the sunlight upon a Grecian shore?

   Just as if, in the heart of their band, which progressed along the ‘front’ like a luminous comet, they had decided that the surrounding crowd was composed of creatures of another race whose sufferings even could not awaken in them any sense of fellowship, they appeared not to see them, forced those who had stopped to talk to step aside, as though from the path of a machine that had been set going by itself, so that it was no good waiting for it to get out of their way, their utmost sign of consciousness being when, if some old gentleman of whom they did not admit the existence and thrust from them the contact, had fled with a frightened or furious, but a headlong or ludicrous motion, they looked at one another and smiled. They had, for whatever did not form part of their group, no affectation of contempt; their genuine contempt was sufficient. But they could not set eyes on an obstacle without amusing themselves by crossing it, either in a running jump or with both feet together, because they were all filled to the brim, exuberant with that youth which we need so urgently to spend that even when we are unhappy or unwell, obedient rather to the necessities of our age than to the mood of the day, we can never pass anything that can be jumped over or slid down without indulging ourselves conscientiously, interrupting, interspersing our slow progress — as Chopin his most melancholy phrase — with graceful deviations in which caprice is blended with virtuosity. The wife of an elderly banker, after hesitating between various possible exposures for her husband, had settled him on a folding chair, facing the ‘front,’ sheltered from wind and sun by the band-stand. Having seen him comfortably installed there, she had gone to buy a newspaper which she would read aloud to him, to distract him — one of her little absences which she never prolonged for more than five minutes, which seemed long enough to him but which she repeated at frequent intervals so that this old husband on whom she lavished an attention that she took care to conceal, should have the impression that he was still quite alive and like other people and was in no need of protection. The platform of the band-stand provided, above his head, a natural and tempting springboard, across which, without a moment’s hesitation, the eldest of the little band began to run; she jumped over the terrified old man, whose yachting cap was brushed by the nimble feet, to the great delight of the other girls, especially of a pair of green eyes in a ‘dashing’ face, which expressed, for that bold act, an admiration and a merriment in which I seemed to discern a trace of timidity, a shamefaced and blustering timidity which did not exist in the others. “Oh, the poor old man; he makes me sick; he looks half dead;” said a girl with a croaking voice, but with more sarcasm than sympathy. They walked on a little way, then stopped for a moment in the middle of the road, with no thought whether they were impeding the passage of other people, and held a council, a solid body of irregular shape, compact, unusual and shrill, like birds that gather on the ground at the moment of flight; then they resumed their leisurely stroll along the ‘front,’ against a background of sea

   By this time their charming features had ceased to be indistinct and impersonal. I had dealt them like cards into so many heaps to compose (failing their names, of which I was still ignorant) the big one who had jumped over the old banker; the little one who stood out against the horizon of sea with her plump and rosy cheeks, her green eyes; the one with the straight nose and dark complexion, in such contrast to all the rest; another, with a white face like an egg on which a tiny nose described an arc of a circle like a chicken’s beak; yet another, wearing a hooded cape (which gave her so poverty-stricken an appearance, and so contradicted the smartness of the figure beneath that the explanation which suggested itself was that this girl must have parents of high position who valued their self-esteem so far above the visitors to Balbec and the sartorial elegance of their own children that it was a matter of the utmost indifference to them that their daughter should stroll on the ‘front’ dressed in a way which humbler people would have considered too modest); a girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, colourless cheeks, a black polo-cap pulled down over her face, who was pushing a bicycle with so exaggerated a movement of her hips, with an air borne out by her language, which was so typically of the gutter and was being shouted so loud, when I passed her (although among her expressions I caught that irritating ‘live my own life’) that, abandoning the hypothesis which her friend’s hooded cape had made me construct, I concluded instead that all these girls belonged to the population which frequents the racing-tracks, and must be the very juvenile mistresses of professional bicyclists. In any event, in none of my suppositions was there any possibility of their being virtuous. At first sight — in the way in which they looked at one another and smiled, in the insistent stare of the one with the dull cheeks — I had grasped that they were not. Besides, my grandmother had always watched over me with a delicacy too timorous for me not to believe that the sum total of the things one ought not to do was indivisible or that girls who were lacking in respect for their elders would suddenly be stopped short by scruples when there were pleasures at stake more tempting than that of jumping over an octogenarian

   Though they were now separately identifiable, still the mutual response which they gave one another with eyes animated by self-sufficiency and the spirit of comradeship, in which were kindled at every moment now the interest now the insolent indifference with which each of them sparkled according as her glance fell on one of her friends or on passing strangers, that consciousness, moreover, of knowing one another intimately enough always to go about together, by making them a ‘band apart’ established between their independent and separate bodies, as slowly they advanced, a bond invisible but harmonious, like a single warm shadow, a single atmosphere making of them a whole as homogeneous in its parts as it was different from the crowd through which their procession gradually wound

   For an instant, as I passed the dark one with the fat cheeks who was wheeling a bicycle, I caught her smiling, sidelong glance, aimed from the centre of that inhuman world which enclosed the life of this little tribe, an inaccessible, unknown world to which the idea of what I was could certainly never attain nor find a place in it. Wholly occupied with what her companions were saying, this young girl in her polo-cap, pulled down very low over her brow, had she seen me at the moment in which the dark ray emanating from her eyes had fallen on me? In the heart of what universe did she distinguish me? It would have been as hard for me to say as, when certain peculiarities are made visible, thanks to the telescope, in a neighbouring planet, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that human beings inhabit it, that they can see us, or to say what ideas the sight of us can have aroused in their minds

   If we thought that the eyes of a girl like that were merely two glittering sequins of mica, we should not be athirst to know her and to unite her life to ours. But we feel that what shines in those reflecting discs is not due solely to their material composition; that it is, unknown to us, the dark shadows of the ideas that the creature is conceiving, relative to the people and places that she knows — the turf of racecourses, the sand of cycling tracks over which, pedalling on past fields and woods, she would have drawn me after her, that little peri, more seductive to me than she of the Persian paradise — the shadows, too, of the home to which she will presently return, of the plans that she is forming or that others have formed for her; and above all that it is she, with her desires, her sympathies, her revulsions, her obscure and incessant will. I knew that I should never possess this young cyclist if I did not possess also what there was in her eyes. And it was consequently her whole life that filled me with desire; a sorrowful desire because I felt that it was not to be realised, but exhilarating, because what had hitherto been my life, having ceased of a sudden to be my whole life, being no more now than a little part of the space stretching out before me, which I was burning to cover and which was composed of the lives of these girls, offered me that prolongation, that possible multiplication of oneself which is happiness. And no doubt the fact that we had, these girls and I, not one habit — as we had not one idea — in common, was to make it more difficult for me to make friends with them and to please them. But perhaps, also, it was thanks to those differences, to my consciousness that there did not enter into the composition of the nature and actions of these girls a single element that I knew or possessed, that there came in place of my satiety a thirst — like that with which a dry land burns — for a life which my soul, because it had never until now received one drop of it, would absorb all the more greedily in long draughts, with a more perfect imbibition

   I had looked so closely at the dark cyclist with the bright eyes that she seemed to notice my attention, and said to the biggest of the girls something that I could not hear. To be honest, this dark one was not the one that pleased me most, simply because she was dark and because (since the day on which, from the little path by Tansonville, I had seen Gilberte) a girl with reddish hair and a golden skin had remained for me the inaccessible ideal. But Gilberte herself, had I not loved her principally because she had appeared to me haloed with that aureole of being the friend of Bergotte, of going with him to look at old cathedrals? And in the same way could I not rejoice at having seen this dark girl look at me (which made me hope that it would be easier for me to get to know her first), for she would introduce me to the others, to the pitiless one who had jumped over the old man’s head, to the cruel one who had said “He makes me sick, poor old man!”— to all of them in turn, among whom, moreover, she had the distinction of being their inseparable companion? And yet the supposition that I might some day be the friend of one or other of these girls, that their eyes, whose incomprehensible gaze struck me now and again, playing upon me unawares, like the play of sunlight upon a wall, might ever, by a miraculous alchemy, allow to interpenetrate among their ineffable particles the idea of my existence, some affection for my person, that I myself might some day take my place among them in the evolution of their course by the sea’s edge — that supposition appeared to me to contain within it a contradiction as insoluble as if, standing before some classical frieze or a fresco representing a procession, I had believed it possible for me, the spectator, to take my place, beloved of them, among the godlike hierophants

   The happiness of knowing these girls was, then, not to be realised. Certainly it would not have been the first of its kind that I had renounced. I had only to recall the numberless strangers whom, even at Balbec, the carriage bowling away from them at full speed had forced me for ever to abandon. And indeed the pleasure that was given me by the little band, as noble as if it had been composed of Hellenic virgins, came from some suggestion that there was in it of the flight of passing figures along a road. This fleetingness of persons who are not known to us, who force us to put out from the harbour of life, in which the women whose society we frequent have all, in course of time, laid bare their blemishes, urges us into that state of pursuit in which there is no longer anything to arrest the imagination. But to strip our pleasures of imagination is to reduce them to their own dimensions, that is to say to nothing. Offered me by one of those procuresses (whose good offices, all the same, the reader has seen that I by no means scorned), withdrawn from the element which gave them so many fine shades and such vagueness, these girls would have enchanted me less. We must have imagination, awakened by the uncertainty of being able to attain our object, to create a goal which hides our other goal from us, and by substituting for sensual pleasures the idea of penetrating into a life prevents us from recognising that pleasure, from tasting its true savour, from restricting it to its own range

   There must be, between us and the fish which, if we saw it for the first time cooked and served on a table, would not appear worth the endless trouble, craft and stratagem that are necessary if we are to catch it, interposed, during our afternoons with the rod, the ripple to whose surface come wavering, without our quite knowing what we intend to do with them, the burnished gleam of flesh, the indefiniteness of a form, in the fluidity of a transparent and flowing azure

   These girls benefited also by that alteration of social values characteristic of seaside life. All the advantages which, in our ordinary environment, extend and magnify our importance, we there find to have become invisible, in fact to be eliminated; while on the other hand the people whom we suppose, without reason, to enjoy similar advantages appear to us amplified to artificial dimensions. This made it easy for strange women generally, and to-day for these girls in particular, to acquire an enormous importance in my eyes, and impossible to make them aware of such importance as I might myself possess

   But if there was this to be said for the excursion of the little band, that it was but an excerpt from the innumerable flight of passing women, which had always disturbed me, their flight was here reduced to a movement so slow as to approach immobility. Now, precisely because, in a phase so far from rapid, faces no longer swept past me in a whirlwind, but calm and distinct still appeared beautiful, I was prevented from thinking as I had so often thought when Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage bore me away that, at closer quarters, if I had stopped for a moment, certain details, a pitted skin, drooping nostrils, a silly gape, a grimace of a smile, an ugly figure might have been substituted, in the face and body of the woman, for those that I had doubtless imagined; for there had sufficed a pretty outline, a glimpse of a fresh complexion, for me to add, in entire good faith, a fascinating shoulder, a delicious glance of which I carried in my mind for ever a memory or a preconceived idea, these rapid decipherings of a person whom we see in motion exposing us thus to the same errors as those too rapid readings in which, on a single syllable and without waiting to identify the rest, we base instead of the word that is in the text a wholly different word with which our memory supplies us. It could not be so with me now. I had looked well at them all; each of them I had seen, not from every angle and rarely in full face, but all the same in two or three aspects different enough to enable me to make either the correction or the verification, to take a ‘proof of the different possibilities of line and colour that are hazarded at first sight, and to see persist in them, through a series of expressions, something unalterably material. I could say to myself with conviction that neither in Paris nor at Balbec, in the most favourable hypotheses of what might have happened, even if I had been able to stop and talk to them, the passing women who had caught my eye, had there ever been one whose appearance, followed by her disappearance without my having managed to know her, had left me with more regret than would these, had given me the idea that her friendship might be a thing so intoxicating. Never, among actresses nor among peasants nor among girls from a convent school had I beheld anything so beautiful, impregnated with so much that was unknown, so inestimably precious, so apparently inaccessible. They were, of the unknown and potential happiness of life, an illustration so delicious and in so perfect a state that it was almost for intellectual reasons that I was desperate with the fear that I might not be able to make, in unique conditions which left no room for any possibility of error, proper trial of what is the most mysterious thing that is offered to us by the beauty which we desire and console ourselves for never possessing, by demanding pleasure — as Swann had always refused to do before Odette’s day — from women whom we have not desired, so that, indeed, we die without having ever known what that other pleasure was. No doubt it was possible that it was not in reality an unknown pleasure, that on a close inspection its mystery would dissipate and vanish, that it was no more than a projection, a mirage of desire. But in that case I could blame only the compulsion of a law of nature — which if it applied to these girls would apply to all — and not the imperfection of the object. For it was that which I should have chosen above all others, feeling quite certain, with a botanist’s satisfaction, that it was not possible to find collected anywhere rarer specimens than these young flowers who were interrupting at this moment before my eyes the line of the sea with their slender hedge, like a bower of Pennsylvania roses adorning a garden on the brink of a cliff, between which is contained the whole tract of ocean crossed by some steamer, so slow in gliding along the blue and horizontal line that stretches from one stem to the next that an idle butterfly, dawdling in the cup of a flower which the moving hull has long since passed, can, if it is to fly and be sure of arriving before the vessel, wait until nothing but the tiniest slice of blue still separates the questing prow from the first petal of the flower towards which it is steering

   I went indoors because I was to dine at Rivebelle with Robert, and my grandmother insisted that on those evenings, before going out, I must lie down for an hour on my bed, a rest which the Balbec doctor presently ordered me to extend to the other evenings also

   However, there was no need, when one went indoors, to leave the ‘front’ and to enter the hotel by the hall, that is to say from behind. By virtue of an alteration of the clock which reminded me of those Saturdays when, at Combray, we used to have luncheon an hour earlier, now with summer at the full the days had become so long that the sun was still high in the heavens, as though it were only tea-time, when the tables were being laid for dinner in the Grand Hotel. And so the great sliding windows were kept open from the ground. I had but to step across a low wooden sill to find myself in the dining-room, through which I walked and straight across to the lift

   As I passed the office I addressed a smile to the manager, and with no shudder of disgust gathered one for myself from his face which, since I had been at Balbec, my comprehensive study of it was injecting and transforming, little by little, like a natural history preparation. His features had become familiar to me, charged with a meaning that was of no importance but still intelligible, like a script which one can read, and had ceased in any way to resemble these queer, intolerable characters which his face had presented to me on that first day, when I had seen before me a personage now forgotten, or, if I succeeded in recalling him, unrecognisable, difficult to identify with this insignificant and polite personality of which the other was but a caricature, a hideous and rapid sketch. Without either the shyness or the sadness of the evening of my arrival I rang for the attendant, who no longer stood in silence while I rose by his side in the lift as in a mobile thoracic cage propelled upwards along its ascending pillar, but repeated:

    “There aren’t the people now there were a month back. They’re beginning to go now; the days are drawing in.” He said this not because there was any truth in it but because, having an engagement, presently, for a warmer part of the coast, he would have liked us all to leave, so that the hotel could be shut up and he have a few days to himself before ‘rejoining’ in his new place. ‘Rejoin’ and ‘new’ were not, by the way, incompatible terms, since, for the lift-boy,‘rejoin’ was the usual form of the verb ‘to join.’ The only thing that surprised me was that he condescended to say ‘place,’ for he belonged to that modern proletariat which seeks to efface from our language every trace of the rule of domesticity. A moment later, however, he informed me that in the ‘situation’ which he was about to ‘rejoin,’ he would have a smarter ‘tunic’ and a better ‘salary,’ the words ‘livery’ and ‘wages’ sounding to him obsolete and unseemly. And as, by an absurd contradiction, the vocabulary has, through thick and thin, among us ‘masters,’ survived the conception of inequality, I was always failing to understand what the lift-boy said. For instance, the only thing that interested me was to know whether my grandmother was in the hotel. Now, forestalling my questions, the lift-boy would say to me: “That lady has just gone out from your rooms.” I was invariably taken in; I supposed that he meant my grandmother. “No, that lady; I think she’s an employee of yours.” As in the old speech of the middle classes, which ought really to be done away with, a cook is not called an employee, I thought for a moment: “But he must be mistaken. We don’t own a factory; we haven’t any employees.” Suddenly I remembered that the title of ‘employee’ is, like the wearing of a moustache among waiters, a sop to their self-esteem given to servants, and realised that this lady who had just gone out must be Françoise (probably on a visit to the coffee-maker, or to watch the Belgian lady’s little maid at her sewing), though even this sop did not satisfy the lift-boy, for he would say quite naturally, speaking pityingly of his own class, ‘with the working man’ or ‘the small person,’ using the same singular form as Racine when he speaks of ‘the poor.’ But as a rule, for my zeal and timidity of the first evening were now things of the past, I no longer spoke to the lift-boy. It was he now who stood there and received no answer during the short journey on which he threaded his way through the hotel, hollowed out inside like a toy, which extended round about us, floor by floor, the ramifications of its corridors in the depths of which the light grew velvety, lost its tone, diminished the communicating doors, the steps of the service stairs which it transformed into that amber haze, unsubstantial and mysterious as a twilight, in which Rembrandt picks out here and there a window-sill or a well-head. And on each landing a golden light reflected from the carpet indicated the setting sun and the lavatory window

   I asked myself whether the girls I had just seen lived at Balbec, and who they could be. When our desire is thus concentrated upon a little tribe of humanity which it singles out from the rest, everything that can be associated with that tribe becomes a spring of emotion and then of reflexion. I had heard a lady say on the ‘front’: “She is a friend of the little Simonet girl” with that self-important air of inside knowledge, as who should say: “He is the inseparable companion of young La Rochefoucauld.” And immediately she had detected on the face of the person to whom she gave this information a curiosity to see more of the favoured person who was ‘a friend of the little Simonet.’ A privilege, obviously, that did not appear to be granted to all the world. For aristocracy is a relative state. And there are plenty of inexpensive little holes and corners where the son of an upholsterer is the arbiter of fashion and reigns over a court like any young Prince of Wales. I have often since then sought to recall how it first sounded for me there on the beach, that name of Simonet, still quite indefinite as to its form, which I had failed to distinguish, and also as to its significance, to the designation by it of such and such a person, or perhaps of some one else; imprinted, in fact, with that vagueness, that novelty which we find so moving in the sequel, when the name whose letters are every moment engraved more deeply on our hearts by our incessant thought of them has become (though this was not to happen to me with the name of the ‘little Simonet’ until several years had passed) the first coherent sound that comes to our lips, whether on waking from sleep or on recovering from a swoon, even before the idea of what o’clock it is or of where we are, almost before the word ‘I,’ as though the person whom it names were more ‘we’ even than we ourselves, and as though after a brief spell of unconsciousness the phase that is the first of all to dissolve is that in which we were not thinking of her. I do not know why I said to myself from the first that the name Simonet must be that of one of the band of girls; from that moment I never ceased to ask myself how I could get to know the Simonet family, get to know them, moreover, through people whom they considered superior to themselves (which ought not to be difficult if the girls were only common little ‘bounders’) so that they might not form a disdainful idea of me. For one cannot have a perfect knowledge, one cannot effect the complete absorption of a person who disdains one, so long as one has not overcome her disdain. And since, whenever the idea of women who are so different from us penetrates our senses, unless we are able to forget it or the competition of other ideas eliminates it, we know no rest until we have converted those aliens into something that is compatible with ourself, our heart being in this respect endowed with the same kind of reaction and activity as our physical organism, which cannot abide the infusion of any foreign body into its veins without at once striving to digest and assimilate it: the little Simonet must be the prettiest of them all — she who, I felt moreover, might yet become my mistress, for she was the only one who, two or three times half-turning her head, had appeared to take cognisance of my fixed stare. I asked the lift-boy whether he knew of any people at Balbec called Simonet. Not liking to admit that there was anything which he did not know, he replied that he seemed to have heard the name somewhere. As we reached the highest landing I told him to have the latest lists of visitors sent up to me

   I stepped out of the lift, but instead of going to my room I made my way farther along the corridor, for before my arrival the valet in charge of the landing, despite his horror of draughts, had opened the window at the end, which instead of looking out to the sea faced the hill and valley inland, but never allowed them to be seen, for its panes, which were made of clouded glass, were generally closed. I made a short ‘station’ in front of it, time enough just to pay my devotions to the view which for once it revealed over the hill against which the back of the hotel rested, a view that contained but a solitary house, planted in the middle distance, though the perspective and the evening light in which I saw it, while preserving its mass, gave it a sculptural beauty and a velvet background, as though to one of those architectural works in miniature, tiny temples or chapels wrought in gold and enamels, which serve as reliquaries and are exposed only on rare and solemn days for the veneration of the faithful. But this moment of adoration had already lasted too long, for the valet, who carried in one hand a bunch of keys and with the other saluted me by touching his verger’s skull-cap, though without raising it, on account of the pure, cool evening air, came and drew together, like those of a shrine, the two sides of the window, and so shut off the minute edifice, the glistening relic from my adoring gaze. I went into my room. Regularly, as the season advanced, the picture that I found there in my window changed. At first it was broad daylight, and dark only if the weather was bad: and then, in the greenish glass which it distended with the curve of its round waves, the sea, set among the iron uprights of my window like a piece of stained glass in its leads, ravelled out over all the deep rocky border of the bay little plumed triangles of an unmoving spray delineated with the delicacy of a feather or a downy breast from Pisanello’s pencil, and fixed in that white, unalterable, creamy enamel which is used to depict fallen snow in Gallé‘s glass

   Presently the days grew shorter and at the moment when I entered my room the violet sky seemed branded with the stiff, geometrical, travelling, effulgent figure of the sun (like the representation of some miraculous sign, of some mystical apparition) leaning over the sea from the hinge of the horizon as a sacred picture leans over a high altar, while the different parts of the western sky exposed in the glass fronts of the low mahogany bookcases that ran along the walls, which I carried back in my mind to the marvellous painting from which they had been detached, seemed like those different scenes which some old master executed long ago for a. confraternity upon a shrine, whose separate panels are now exhibited side by side upon the wall of a museum gallery, so that the visitor’s imagination alone can restore them to their place on the predella of the reredos. A few weeks later, when I went upstairs, the sun had already set. Like the one that I used to see at Combray, behind the Calvary, when I was coming home from a walk and looking forward to going down to the kitchen before dinner, a band of red sky over the sea, compact and clear-cut as a layer of aspic over meat, then, a little later, over a sea already cold and blue like a grey mullet, a sky of the same pink as the salmon that we should presently be ordering at Rivebelle reawakened the pleasure which I was to derive from the act of dressing to go out to dinner. Over the sea, quite near the shore, were trying to rise, one beyond another, at wider and wider intervals, vapours of a pitchy blackness but also of the polish and consistency of agate, of a visible weight, so much so that the highest among them, poised at the end of their contorted stem and overreaching the centre of gravity of the pile that had hitherto supported them, seemed on the point of bringing down in ruin this lofty structure already half the height of the sky, and of precipitating it into the sea. The sight of a ship that was moving away like a nocturnal traveller gave me the same impression that I had had in the train of being set free from the necessity of sleep and from confinement in a bedroom. Not that I felt myself a prisoner in the room in which I now was, since in another hour I should have left it and be getting into the carriage. I threw myself down on the bed; and, just as if I had been lying in a berth on board one of those steamers which I could see quite near to me and which, when night came, it would be strange to see stealing slowly out into the darkness, like shadowy and silent but unsleeping swans, I was on all sides surrounded by pictures of the sea

   But as often as not they were, indeed, only pictures; I forgot that below their coloured expanse was hollowed the sad desolation of the beach, travelled by the restless evening breeze whose breath I had so anxiously felt on my arrival at Balbec; besides, even in my room, being wholly taken up with thoughts of the girls whom I had seen go past, I was no longer in a state of mind calm or disinterested enough to allow the formation of any really deep impression of beauty. The anticipation of dinner at Rivebelle made my mood more frivolous still, and my mind, dwelling at such moments upon the surface of the body which I was going to dress up so as to try to appear as pleasing as possible in the feminine eyes which would be scrutinising me in the brilliantly lighted restaurant, was incapable of putting any depth behind the colour of things. And if, beneath my window, the unwearying, gentle flight of sea-martins and swallows had not arisen like a playing fountain, like living fireworks, joining the intervals between their soaring rockets with the motionless white streaming lines of long horizontal wakes of foam, without the charming miracle of this natural and local phenomenon, which brought into touch with reality the scenes that I had before my eyes, I might easily have believed that they were no more than a selection, made afresh every day, of paintings which were shewn quite arbitrarily in the place in which I happened to be and without having any necessary connexion with that place. At one time it was an exhibition of Japanese colour-prints: beside the neat disc of sun, red and round as the moon, a yellow cloud seemed a lake against which black swords were outlined like the trees upon its shore; a bar of a tender pink which I had never seen again after my first paint-box swelled out into a river on either bank of which boats seemed to be waiting high and dry for some one to push them down and set them afloat. And with the contemptuous, bored, frivolous glance of an amateur or a woman hurrying through a picture gallery between two social engagements, I would say to myself: “Curious sunset, this; it’s different from what they usually are but after all I’ve seen them just as fine, just as remarkable as this.” I had more pleasure on evenings when a ship, absorbed and liquefied by the horizon so much the same in colour as herself (an Impressionist exhibition this time) that it seemed to be also of the same matter, appeared as if some one had simply cut out with a pair of scissors her bows and the rigging in which she tapered into a slender filigree from the vaporous blue of the sky. Sometimes the ocean filled almost the whole of my window, when it was enlarged and prolonged by a band of sky edged at the top only by a line that was of the same blue as the sea, so that I supposed it all to be still sea, and the change in colour due only to some effect of light and shade. Another day the sea was painted only in the lower part of the window, all the rest of which was so filled with innumerable clouds, packed one against another in horizontal bands, that its panes seemed to be intended, for some special purpose or to illustrate a special talent of the artist, to present a ‘Cloud Study,’ while the fronts of the various bookcases shewing similar clouds but in another part of the horizon and differently coloured by the light, appeared to be offering as it were the repetition — of which certain of our contemporaries are so fond — of one and the same effect always observed at different hours but able now in the immobility of art to be seen all together in a single room, drawn in pastel and mounted under glass. And sometimes to a sky and sea uniformly grey a rosy touch would be added with an exquisite delicacy, while a little butterfly that had gone to sleep at the foot of the window seemed to be attaching with its wings at the corner of this ‘Harmony in Grey and Pink’ in the Whistler manner the favourite signature of the Chelsea master. The pink vanished; there was nothing now left to look at. I rose for a moment and before lying down again drew dose the inner curtains. Above them I could see from my bed the ray of light that still remained, growing steadily fainter and thinner, but it was without any feeling of sadness, without any regret for its passing that I thus allowed to die above the curtains the hour at which, as a rule, I was seated at table, for I knew that this day was of another kind than ordinary days, longer, like those arctic days which night interrupts for a few minutes only; I knew that from the chrysalis of the dusk was preparing to emerge, by a radiant metamorphosis, the dazzling light of the Rivebelle restaurant. I said to myself: “It is time”; I stretched myself on the bed, and rose, and finished dressing; and I found a charm in these idle moments, lightened of every material burden, in which while down below the others were dining I was employing the forces accumulated during the inactivity of this last hour of the day only in drying my washed body, in putting on a dinner jacket, in tying my tie, in making all those gestures which were already dictated by the anticipated pleasure of seeing again some woman whom I had noticed, last time, at Rivebelle, who had seemed to be watching me, had perhaps left the table for a moment only in the hope that I would follow her; it was with joy that I enriched myself with all these attractions so as to give myself, whole, alert, willing, to a new life, free, without cares, in which I would lean my hesitations upon the calm strength of Saint-Loup, and would choose from among the different species of animated nature and the produce of every land those which, composing the unfamiliar dishes that my companion would at once order, might have tempted my appetite or my imagination. And then at the end of the season came the days when I could no longer pass indoors from the ‘front’ through the dining-room; its windows stood open no more, for it was night now outside and the swarm of poor folk and curious idlers, attracted by the blaze of light which they might not reach, hung in black clusters chilled by the north wind to the luminous sliding walls of that buzzing hive of glass

   There was a knock at my door; it was Aimé who had come upstairs in person with the latest lists of visitors

   Aimé could not go away without telling me that Dreyfus was guilty a thousand times over. “It will all come out,” he assured me, “not this year, but next. It was a gentleman who’s very thick with the General Staff, told me. I asked him if they wouldn’t decide to bring it all to light at once, before the year is out. He laid down his cigarette,” Aimé went on, acting the scene for my benefit, and, shaking his head and his forefinger as his informant had done, as much as to say: “We mustn’t expect too much!”—”‘Not this year, Aimé,’ those were his very words, putting his hand on my shoulder, ‘It isn’t possible. But next Easter, yes!’” And Aimé tapped me gently on my shoulder, saying, “You see, I’m letting you have it exactly as he told me,” whether because he was flattered at this act of familiarity by a distinguished person or so that I might better appreciate, with a full knowledge of the facts, the worth of the arguments and our grounds for hope

   It was not without a slight throb of the heart that on the first page of the list I caught sight of the words ‘Simonet and family.’ I had in me a store of old dream-memories which dated from my childhood, and in which all the tenderness (tenderness that existed in my heart, but, when my heart felt it, was not distinguishable from anything else) was wafted to me by a person as different as possible from myself. This person, once again I fashioned her, utilising for the purpose the name Simonet and the memory of the harmony that had reigned between the young bodies which I had seen displaying themselves on the beach, in a sportive procession worthy of Greek art or of Giotto. I knew not which of these girls was Mlle. Simonet, if indeed any of them were so named, but I did know that I was loved by Mlle. Simonet and that I was going, with Saint-Loup’s help, to attempt to know her. Unfortunately, having on that condition only obtained an extension of his leave, he was obliged to report for duty every day at Doncières: but to make him forsake his military duty I had felt that I might count, more even than on his friendship for myself, on that same curiosity, as a human naturalist, which I myself had so often felt — even without having seen the person mentioned, and simply on hearing some one say that there was a pretty cashier at a fruiterer’s — to acquaint myself with a new variety of feminine beauty. But that curiosity I had been wrong in hoping to excite in Saint-Loup by speaking to him of my band of girls. For it had been and would long remain paralysed in him by his love for that actress whose lover he was. And even if he had felt it lightly stirring him he would have repressed it, from an almost superstitious belief that on his own fidelity might depend that of his mistress. And so it was without any promise from him that he would take an active interest in my girls that we started out to dine at Rivebelle

   At first, when we arrived there, the sun used just to have set, but it was light still; in the garden outside the restaurant, where the lamps had not yet been lighted, the heat of the day fell and settled, as though in a vase along the sides of which the transparent, dusky jelly of the air seemed of such consistency that a tall rose-tree fastened against the dim wall which it streaked with pink veins, looked like the arborescence that one sees at the heart of an onyx. Presently night had always fallen when we left the carriage, often indeed before we started from Balbec if the evening was wet and we had put off sending for the carriage in the hope of the weather’s improving. But on those days it was without any sadness that I listened to the wind howling, I knew that it did not mean the abandonment of my plans, imprisonment in my bedroom; I knew that in the great dining-room of the restaurant, which we would enter to the sound of the music of the gypsy band, the innumerable lamps would triumph easily over darkness and chill, by applying to them their broad cauteries of molten gold, and I jumped light-heartedly after Saint-Loup into the closed carriage which stood waiting for us in the rain. For some time past the words of Bergotte, when he pronounced himself positive that, in spite of all I might say, I had been created to enjoy, pre-eminently, the pleasures of the mind, had restored to me, with regard to what I might succeed in achieving later on, a hope that was disappointed afresh every day by the boredom that I felt on setting myself down before a writing-table to start work on a critical essay or a novel. “After all,” I said to myself, “possibly the pleasure that its author has found in writing it is not the infallible test of the literary value of a page; it may be only an accessory, one that is often to be found superadded to that value, but the want of which can have no prejudicial effect on it. Perhaps some of the greatest masterpieces were written yawning.” My grandmother set my doubts at rest by telling me that I should be able to work and should enjoy working as soon as my health improved. And, our doctor having thought it only prudent to warn me of the grave risks to which my state of health might expose me, and having outlined all the hygienic precaution that I ought to take to avoid any accident — I subordinated all my pleasures to an object which I judged to be infinitely more important than them, that of becoming strong enough to be able to bring into being the work which I had, possibly, within me; I had been exercising over myself, ever since I had come to Balbec, a scrupulous and constant control. Nothing would have induced me, there, to touch the cup of coffee which would have robbed me of the night’s sleep that was necessary if I was not to be tired next day. But as soon as we reached Rivebelle, immediately, what with the excitement of a new pleasure, and finding myself in that different zone into which the exception to our rule of life takes us after it has cut the thread, patiently spun throughout so many days, that was guiding us towards wisdom — as though there were never to be any such thing as to-morrow, nor any lofty aims to be realised, vanished all that exact machinery of prudent hygienic measures which had been working to safeguard them. A waiter was offering to take my coat, whereupon Saint-Loup asked: “You’re sure you won’t be cold? Perhaps you’d better keep it: it’s not very warm in here.”

    “No, no,” I assured him; and perhaps I did not feel the cold; but however that might be, I no longer knew the fear of falling ill, the necessity of not dying, the importance of work. I gave up my coat; we entered the dining-room to the sound of some warlike march played by the gipsies, we advanced between two rows of tables laid for dinner as along an easy path of glory, and, feeling a happy glow imparted to our bodies by the rhythms of the orchestra which rendered us its military honours, gave us this unmerited triumph, we concealed it beneath a grave and frozen mien, beneath a languid, casual gait, so as not to be like those music-hall ‘mashers’ who, having wedded a ribald verse to a patriotic air, come running on to the stage with the martial countenance of a victorious general

   From that moment I was a new man, who was no longer my grandmother’s grandson and would remember her only when it was time to get up and go, but the brother, for the time being, of the waiters who were going to bring us our dinner

   The dose of beer — all the more, that of champagne — which at Balbec I should not have ventured to take in a week, albeit to my calm and lucid consciousness the flavour of those beverages represented a pleasure clearly appreciable, since it was also one that could easily be sacrificed, I now imbibed at a sitting, adding to it a few drops of port wine, too much distracted to be able to taste it, and I gave the violinist who had just been playing the two louis which I had been saving up for the last month with a view to buying something, I could not remember what. Several of the waiters, set going among the tables, were flying along at full speed, each carrying on his outstretched palms a dish which it seemed to be the object of this kind of race not to let fall. And in fact the chocolate soufflés arrived at their destination unspilled, the potatoes à l’anglaise, in spite of the pace which ought to have sent them flying, came arranged as at the start round the Pauilhac lamb. I noticed one of these servants, very tall, plumed with superb black locks, his face dyed in a tint that suggested rather certain species of rare birds than a human being, who, running without pause (and, one would have said, without purpose) from one end of the room to the other, made me think of one of those macaws which fill the big aviaries in zoological gardens with their gorgeous colouring and incomprehensible agitation. Presently the spectacle assumed an order, in my eyes at least, growing at once more noble and more calm. All this dizzy activity became fixed in a quiet harmony. I looked at the round tables whose innumerable assemblage filled the restaurant like so many planets as planets are represented in old allegorical pictures. Moreover, there seemed to be some irresistibly attractive force at work among these divers stars, and at each table the diners had eyes only for the tables at which they were not sitting, except perhaps some wealthy amphitryon who, having managed to secure a famous author, was endeavouring to extract from him, thanks to the magic properties of the turning table, a few unimportant remarks at which the ladies marvelled. The harmony of these astral tables did not prevent the incessant revolution of the countless servants who, because instead of being seated like the diners they were on their feet, performed their evolutions in a more exalted sphere. No doubt they were running, one to fetch the hors d’oeuvres, another to change the wine or with clean glasses. But despite these special reasons, their perpetual course among the round tables yielded, after a time, to the observer the law of its dizzy but ordered circulation. Seated behind a bank of flowers, two horrible cashiers, busy with endless calculations, seemed two witches occupied in forecasting by astrological signs the disasters that might from time to time occur in this celestial vault fashioned according to the scientific conceptions of the middle ages

   And I rather pitied all the diners because I felt that for them the round tables were not planets and that they had not cut through the scheme of things one of those sections which deliver us from the bondage of appearances and enable us to perceive analogies. They thought that they were dining with this or that person, that the dinner would cost roughly so much, and that to-morrow they would begin all over again. And they appeared absolutely unmoved by the progress through their midst of a train of young assistants who, having probably at that moment no urgent duty, advanced processionally bearing rolls of bread in baskets. Some of them, the youngest, stunned by the cuffs which the head waiters administered to them as they passed, fixed melancholy eyes upon a distant dream and were consoled only if some visitor from the Balbec hotel in which they had once been employed, recognising them, said a few words to them, telling them in person to take away the champagne which was not fit to drink, an order that filled them with pride

   I could hear the twinging of my nerves, in which there was a sense of comfort independent of the external objects that might have produced it, a comfort which the least shifting of my body or of my attention was enough to make me feel, just as to a shut eye a slight pressure gives the sensation of colour. I had already drunk a good deal of port wine, and if I now asked for more it was not so much with a view to the comfort which the additional glasses would bring me as an effect of the comfort produced by the glasses that had gone before. I allowed the music itself to guide to each of its notes my pleasure which, meekly following, rested on each in turn. If, like one of those chemical industries by means of which are prepared in large quantities bodies which in a state of nature come together only by accident and very rarely, this restaurant at Rivebelle united at one and the same moment more women to tempt me with beckoning vistas of happiness than the hazard of walks and drives would have made me encounter in a year; on the other hand, this music that greeted our ears — arrangements of waltzes, of German operettas, of music-hall songs, all of them quite new to me — was itself like an ethereal resort of pleasure superimposed upon the other and more intoxicating still. For these tunes, each as individual as a woman, were not keeping, as she would have kept, for some privileged person, the voluptuous secret which they contained: they offered me their secrets, ogled me, came up to me with affected or vulgar movements, accosted me, caressed me as if I had suddenly become more seductive, more powerful and more rich; I indeed found in these tunes an element of cruelty; because any such thing as a disinterested feeling for beauty, a gleam of intelligence was unknown to them; for them physical pleasures alone existed. And they are the most merciless of hells, the most gateless and imprisoning for the jealous wretch to whom they present that pleasure — that pleasure which the woman he loves is enjoying with another — as the only thing that exists in the world for her who is all the world to him. But while I was humming softly to myself the notes of this tune, and returning its kiss, the pleasure peculiar to itself which it made me feel became so dear to me that I would have left my father and mother, to follow it through the singular world which it constructed in the invisible, in lines instinct with alternate languor and vivacity. Although such a pleasure as this is not calculated to enhance the value of the person to whom it comes, for it is perceived by him alone, and although whenever, in the course of our life, we have failed to attract a woman who has caught sight of us, she could not tell whether at that moment we possessed this inward and subjective felicity which, consequently, could in no way have altered the judgment that she passed on us, I felt myself more powerful, almost irresistible. It seemed to me that my love was no longer something unattractive, at which people might smile, but had precisely the touching beauty, the seductiveness of this music, itself comparable to a friendly atmosphere in which she whom I loved and I were to meet, suddenly grown intimate

   This restaurant was the resort not only of light women; it was frequented also by people in the very best society, who came there for afternoon tea or gave big dinner-parties. The tea-parties were held in a long gallery, glazed and narrow, shaped like a funnel, which led from the entrance hall to the dining-room and was bounded on one side by the garden, from which it was separated (save for a few stone pillars) only by its wall of glass, in which panes would be opened here and there. The result of which, apart from ubiquitous draughts, was sudden and intermittent bursts of sunshine, a dazzling light that made it almost impossible to see the tea-drinkers, so that when they were installed there, at tables crowded pair after pair the whole way along the narrow gully, as they were shot with colours at every movement they made in drinking their tea or in greeting one another, you would have called it a reservoir, a stewpond in which the fisherman has collected all his glittering catch, and the fish, half out of water and bathed in sunlight, dazzle the eye as they mirror an ever-changing iridescence

   A few hours later, during dinner, which, naturally, was served in the dining-room, the lights would be turned on, although it was still quite light out of doors, so that one saw before one’s eyes, in the garden, among summer-houses glimmering in the twilight, like pale spectres of evening, alleys whose greyish verdure was pierced by the last rays of the setting sun and, from the lamp-lit room in which we were dining, appeared through the glass — no longer, as one would have said of the ladies who had been drinking tea there in the afternoon, along the blue and gold corridor, caught in a glittering and dripping net — but like the vegetation of a pale and green aquarium of gigantic size seen by a supernatural light. People began to rise from table; and if each party while their dinner lasted, albeit they spent the whole time examining, recognising, naming the party at the next table, had been held in perfect cohesion about their own, the attractive force that had kept them gravitating round their host of the evening lost its power at the moment when, for coffee, they repaired to the same corridor that had been used for the tea-parties; it often happened that in its passage from place to place some party on the march dropped one or more of its human corpuscles who, having come under the irresistible attraction of the rival party, detached themselves for a moment from their own, in which their places were taken by ladies or gentlemen who had come across to speak to friends before hurrying off with an “I really must fly: I’m dining with M. So-and-So.” And for the moment you would have been reminded, looking at them, of two separate nosegays that had exchanged a few of their flowers. Then the corridor too began to empty. Often, since even after dinner there was still a little light left outside, they left this long corridor unlighted, and, skirted by the trees that overhung it on the other side of the glass, it suggested a pleached alley in a wooded and shady garden. Here and there, in the gloom, a fair diner lingered. As I passed through this corridor one evening on my way out I saw, sitting among a group of strangers, the beautiful Princesse de Luxembourg. I raised my hat without stopping. She remembered me, and bowed her head with a smile; in the air, far above her bowed head, but emanating from the movement, rose melodiously a few words addressed to myself, which must have been a somewhat amplified good-evening, intended not to stop me but simply to complete the gesture, to make it a spoken greeting. But her words remained so indistinct and the sound which was all that I caught was prolonged so sweetly and seemed to me so musical that it seemed as if among the dim branches of the trees a nightingale had begun to sing. If it so happened that, to finish the evening with a party of his friends whom we had met, Saint-Loup decided to go on to the Casino of a neighbouring village, and, taking them with him, put me in a carriage by myself, I would urge the driver to go as fast as he possibly could, so that the minutes might pass less slowly which I must spend without having anyone at hand to dispense me from the obligation myself to provide my sensibility — reversing the engine, so to speak, and emerging from the passivity in which I was caught and held as in the teeth of a machine — with those modifications which, since my arrival at Rivebelle, I had been receiving from other people. The risk of collision with a carriage coming the other way along those lanes where there was barely room for one and it was dark as pitch, the insecurity of the soil, crumbling in many places, at the cliff’s edge, the proximity of its vertical drop to the sea, none of these things exerted on me the slight stimulus that would have been required to bring the vision and the fear of danger within the scope of my reasoning. For just as it is not the desire to become famous but the habit of being laborious that enables us to produce a finished work, so it is not the activity of the present moment but wise reflexions from the past that help us to safeguard the future. But if already, before this point, on my arrival at Rivebelle, I had flung irretrievably away from me those crutches of reason and self-control which help our infirmity to follow the right road, if I now found myself the victim of a sort of moral ataxy, the alcohol that I had drunk, by unduly straining my nerves, gave to the minutes as they came a quality, a charm which did not have the result of leaving me more ready, or indeed more resolute to inhibit them, prevent their coming; for while it made me prefer them a thousand times to anything else in my life, my exaltation made me isolate them from everything else; I was confined to the present, as heroes are or drunkards; eclipsed for the moment, my past no longer projected before me that shadow of itself which we call our future; placing the goal of my life no longer in the realisation of the dreams of that past, but in the felicity of the present moment, I could see nothing now of what lay beyond it. So that, by a contradiction which, however, was only apparent, it was at the very moment in which I was tasting an unfamiliar pleasure, feeling that my life might yet be happy, in which it should have become more precious in my sight; it was at this very moment that, delivered from the anxieties which my life had hitherto contrived to suggest to me, I unhesitatingly abandoned it to the chance of an accident. After all, I was doing no more than concentrate in a single evening the carelessness that, for most men, is diluted throughout their whole existence, in which every day they face, unnecessarily, the dangers of a sea-voyage, of a trip in an aeroplane or motor-car, when there is waiting for them at home the creature whose life their death would shatter, or when there is still stored in the fragile receptacle of their brain that book the approaching publication of which is their one object, now, in life. And so too in the Rivebelle restaurant, on evenings when we just stayed there after dinner, if anyone had come in with the intention of killing me, as I no longer saw, save in a distant prospect too remote to have any reality, my grandmother, my life to come, the books that I was going to write, as I clung now, body and mind, wholly to the scent of the lady at the next table, the politeness of the waiters, the outline of the waltz that the band was playing, as I was glued to my immediate sensation, with no extension beyond its limits, nor any object other than not to be separated from it, I should have died in and with that sensation, I should have let myself be strangled without offering any resistance, without a movement, a bee drugged with tobacco smoke that had ceased to take any thought for preserving the accumulation of its labours and the hopes of its hive

   I ought here to add that this insignificance into which the most serious matters subsided, by contrast with the violence of my exaltation, came in the end to include Mlle. Simonet and her friends. The enterprise of knowing them seemed to me easy now but hardly worth the trouble, for my immediate sensation alone, thanks to its extraordinary intensity, to the joy that its slightest modifications, its mere continuity provoked, had any importance for me; all the rest — parents, work, pleasures, girls at Balbec weighed with me no more than does a flake of foam in a strong wind that will not let it find a resting place, existed no longer save in relation to this internal power: intoxication makes real for an hour or two a subjective idealism, pure phenomenism; nothing is left now but appearances, nothing exists save as a function of our sublime self. This is not to say that a genuine love, if we have one, cannot survive in such conditions. But we feel so unmistakably, as though in a new atmosphere, that unknown pressures have altered the dimensions of that sentiment that we can no longer consider it in the old way. It is indeed still there and we shall find it, but in a different place, no longer weighing upon us, satisfied by the sensation which the present affords it, a sensation that is sufficient for us, since for what is not actually present we take no thought. Unfortunately the coefficient which thus alters our values alters them only in the hour of intoxication. The people who had lost all their importance, whom we scattered with our breath like soap-bubbles, will to-morrow resume their density; we shall have to try afresh to settle down to work which this evening had ceased to have any significance. A more serious matter still, these mathematics of the morrow, the same as those of yesterday, in whose problems we shall find ourselves inexorably involved, it is they that govern us even in these hours, and we alone are unconscious of their rule. If there should happen to be, near us, a woman, virtuous or inimical, that question so difficult an hour ago — to know whether we should succeed in finding favour with her — seems to us now a million times easier of solution without having become easier in any respect, for it is only in our own sight, in our own inward sight, that we have altered. And she is as much annoyed with us at this moment as we shall be next day at the thought of our having given a hundred francs to the messenger, and for the same reason which in our case has merely been delayed in its operation, namely the absence of intoxication

   I knew none of the women who were at Rivebelle and, because they formed a part of my intoxication just as its reflexions form part of a mirror, appeared to me now a thousand times more to be desired than the less and less existent Mlle. Simonet. One of them, young, fair, by herself, with a sad expression on a face framed in a straw hat trimmed with field-flowers, gazed at me for a moment with a dreamy air and struck me as being attractive. Then it was the turn of another, and of a third; finally of a dark one with glowing cheeks. Almost all of them were known, if not to myself, to Saint-Loup

   He had, in fact, before he made the acquaintance of his present mistress, lived so much in the restricted world of amorous adventure that all the women who would be dining on these evenings at Rivebelle, where many of them had appeared quite by chance, having come to the coast some to join their lovers, others in the hope of finding fresh lovers there, there was scarcely one that he did not know from having spent — or if not he, one or other of his friends — at least one night in their company. He did not bow to them if they were with men, and they, albeit they looked more at him than at anyone else, for the indifference which he was known to feel towards every woman who was not his mistress gave him in their eyes an exceptional interest, appeared not to know him. But you could hear them whispering: “That’s young Saint-Loup. It seems he’s still quite gone on that girl of his. Got it bad, he has. What a dear boy! I think he’s just wonderful; and what style! Some girls do have all the luck, don’t they? And he’s so nice in every way. I saw a lot of him when I was with d’Orléans. They were quite inseparable, those two. He was going the pace, that time. But he’s given it all up now, she can’t complain. She’s had a good run of luck, that she can say. And I ask you, what in the world can he see in her? He must be a bit of a chump, when all’s said and done. She’s got feet like boats, whiskers like an American, and her undies are filthy. I can tell you, a little shop girl would be ashamed to be seen in her knickers. Do just look at his eyes a moment; you would jump into the fire for a man like that. Hush, don’t say a word; he’s seen me; look, he’s smiling. Oh, he remembers me all right. Just you mention my name to him, and see what he says!” Between these girls and him I surprised a glance of mutual understanding. I should have liked him to introduce me to them, so that I might ask them for assignations and they give them to me, even if I had been unable to keep them. For otherwise their appearance would remain for all time devoid, in my memory, of that part of itself — just as though it had been hidden by a veil — which varies in every woman, which we cannot imagine in any woman until we have actually seen it in her, and which is apparent only in the glance that she directs at us, that acquiesces in our desire and promises that it shall be satisfied. And yet, even when thus reduced, their aspect was for me far more than that of women whom I should have known to be virtuous, and it seemed to me not to be, like theirs, flat, with nothing behind it, fashioned in one piece with no solidity. It was not, of course, for me what it must be for Saint-Loup who, by an act of memory, beneath the indifference, transparent to him, of the motionless features which affected not to know him, or beneath the dull formality of the greeting that might equally well have been addressed to anyone else, could recall, could see, through dishevelled locks, a swooning mouth, a pair of half-closed eyes, a whole silent picture like those that painters, to cheat their visitors’ senses, drape with a decent covering. Undoubtedly, for me who felt that nothing of my personality had penetrated the surface of this woman or that, or would be borne by her upon the unknown ways which she would tread through life, those faces remained sealed. But it was quite enough to know that they did open, for them to seem to me of a price which I should not have set on them had they been but precious medals, instead of lockets within which were hidden memories of love. As for Robert, scarcely able to keep in his place at table, concealing beneath a courtier’s smile his warrior’s thirst for action — when I examined him I could see how closely the vigorous structure of his triangular face must have been modelled on that of his ancestors’ faces, a face devised rather for an ardent bowman than for a delicate student. Beneath his fine skin the bold construction, the feudal architecture were apparent. His head made one think of those old dungeon keeps on which the disused battlements are still to be seen, although inside they have been converted into libraries

   On our way back to Balbec, of those of the fair strangers to whom he had introduced me I would repeat to myself without a moment’s interruption, and yet almost unconsciously: “What a delightful woman!” as one chimes in with the refrain of a song. I admit that these words were prompted rather by the state of my nerves than by any lasting judgment. It was nevertheless true that if I had had a thousand francs on me and if there had still been a jeweller’s shop open at that hour, I should have bought the lady a ring. When the successive hours of our life are thus displayed against too widely dissimilar backgrounds, we find that we give away too much of ourselves to all sorts of people who next day will not interest us in the least. But we feel that we are still responsible for what we said to them overnight, and that we must honour our promises

   As on these evenings I came back later than usual to the hotel, it was with joy that I recognised, in a room no longer hostile, the bed on which, on the day of my arrival, I had supposed that it would always be impossible for me to find any rest, whereas now my weary limbs turned to it for support; so that, in turn, thighs, hips, shoulders burrowed into, trying to adhere at every angle to, the sheets that covered its mattress, as if my fatigue, like a sculptor, had wished to take a cast of an entire human body. But I could not go to sleep; I felt the approach of morning; peace of mind, health of body, were no longer mine. In my distress it seemed that never should I recapture them. I should have had to sleep for a long time if I were to overtake them. But then, had I begun to doze, I must in any event be awakened in a couple of hours by the symphonic concert on the beach. Suddenly I was asleep, I had fallen into that deep slumber in which are opened to us a return to childhood, the recapture of past years, of lost feelings, the disincarnation, the transmigration of the soul, the evoking of the dead, the illusions of madness, retrogression towards the most elementary of the natural kingdoms (for we say that we often see animals in our dreams, but we forget almost always that we are ourself then an animal deprived of that reasoning power which projects upon things the light of certainty; we present on the contrary to the spectacle of life only a dubious vision, destroyed afresh every moment by oblivion, the former reality fading before that which follows it as one projection of a magic lantern fades before the next as we change the slide), all those mysteries which we imagine ourselves not to know and into which we are in reality initiated almost every night, as we are into the other great mystery of annihilation and resurrection. Rendered more vagabond by the difficulty of digesting my Rivebelle dinner, the successive and flickering illumination of shadowy zones of my past made of me a being whose supreme happiness would have been that of meeting Legrandin, with whom I had just been talking in my dream

   And then, even my own life was entirely hidden from me by a new setting, like the ‘drop’ lowered right at the front of the stage before which, while the scene snifters are busy behind, actors appear in a fresh ‘turn.’ The turn in which I was now cast for a part was in the manner of an Oriental fairy-tale; I retained no knowledge of my past or of myself, on account of the intense proximity of this interpolated scenery; I was merely a person who received the bastinado and underwent various punishments for a crime the nature of which I could not distinguish, though it was actually that of having taken too much port wine. Suddenly I awoke and discovered that, thanks to a long sleep, I had not heard a note of the concert. It was already afternoon; I verified this by my watch after several efforts to sit up in bed, efforts fruitless at first and interrupted by backward falls on to my pillow, but those short falls which are a sequel of sleep as of other forms of intoxication, whether due to wine or to convalescence; besides, before I had so much as looked at the time, I was certain that it was past midday. Last night I had been nothing more than an empty vessel, without weight, and (since I must first have gone to bed to be able to keep still, and have been asleep to be able to keep silent) had been unable to refrain from moving about and talking; I had no longer any stability, any centre of gravity, I was set in motion and it seemed that I might have continued on my dreary course until I reached the moon. But if, while I slept, my eyes had not seen the time, my body had nevertheless contrived to calculate it, had measured the hours; not on a dial superficially marked and figured, but by the steadily growing weight of all my replenished forces which, like, a powerful clockwork, it had allowed, notch by notch, to descend from my brain into the rest of my body in which there had risen now to above my knees the unbroken abundance of their store. If it is true that the sea was once upon a time our native element, into which we must plunge our cooling blood if we are to recover our strength, it is the same with the oblivion, the mental non-existence of sleep; we seem then to absent ourselves for a few hours from Time, but the forces which we have gathered in that interval without expending them, measure it by their quantity as accurately as the pendulum of the clock or the crumbling pyramid of the sandglass. Nor does one emerge more easily from such sleep than from a prolonged spell of wakefulness, so strongly does everything tend to persist; and if it is true that certain narcotics make us sleep, to have slept for any time is an even stronger narcotic, after which we have great difficulty in making ourselves wake up. Like a sailor who sees plainly the harbour in which he can moor his vessel, still tossed by the waves, I had a quite definite idea of looking at the time and of getting up, but my body was at every moment cast back upon the tide of sleep; the landing was difficult, and before I attained a position in which I could reach my watch and confront with its time that indicated by the wealth of accumulated material which my stiffened limbs had at their disposal, I fell back two or three times more upon my pillow

   At length I could reach and read it: “Two o’clock in the afternoon!” I rang; but at once I returned to a slumber which, this time, must have lasted infinitely longer, if I was to judge by the refreshment, the vision of an immense night overpassed, which I found on awakening. And yet as my awakening was caused by the entry of Françoise, and as her entry had been prompted by my ringing the bell, this second sleep which, it seemed to me, must have been longer than the other, and had brought me so much comfort and forgetfulness, could not have lasted for more than half a minute

   My grandmother opened the door of my bedroom; I asked her various questions about the Legrandin family

   It is not enough to say that I had returned to tranquillity and health, for it was more than a mere interval of space that had divided them from me yesterday, I had had all night long to struggle against a contrary tide, and now I not only found myself again in their presence, they had once more entered into me. At certain definite and still somewhat painful points beneath the surface of my empty head which would one day be broken, letting my ideas escape for all time, those ideas had once again taken their proper places and resumed that existence by which hitherto, alas, they had failed to profit

   Once again I had escaped from the impossibility of sleeping, from the deluge, the shipwreck of my nervous storms. I feared now not at all the menaces that had loomed over me the evening before, when I was dismantled of repose. A new life was opening before me; without making a single movement, for I was still shattered, although quite alert and well, I savoured my weariness with a light heart; it had isolated and broken asunder the bones of my legs and arms, which I could feel assembled before me, ready to cleave together, and which I was to raise to life merely by singing, like the builder in the fable

   Suddenly I thought of the fair girl with the sad expression whom I had seen at Rivebelle, where she had looked at me for a moment. Many others, in the course of the evening, had seemed to me attractive; now she alone arose from the dark places of my memory. I had felt that she noticed me, had expected one of the waiters to come to me with a whispered message from her. Saint-Loup did not know her and fancied that she was respectable. It would be very difficult to see her, to see her constantly. But I was prepared to make any sacrifice, I thought now only of her. Philosophy distinguishes often between free and necessary acts. Perhaps there is none to the necessity of which we are more completely subjected than that which, by virtue of an ascending power held in check during the act itself, makes so unfailingly (once our mind is at rest) spring up a memory that was levelled with other memories by the distributed pressure of our indiffer-ance, and rush to the surface, because unknown to us it contained, more than any of the others, a charm of which we do not become aware until the following day. And perhaps there is not, either, any act so free, for it is still unprompted by habit, by that sort of mental hallucination which, when we are in love, facilitates the invariable reappearance of the image of one particular person

   This was the day immediately following that on which I had seen file past me against a background of sea the beautiful procession of young girls. I put questions about them to a number of the visitors in the hotel, people who came almost every year to Balbec. They could tell me nothing. Later on, a photograph shewed me why. Who could ever recognise now in them, scarcely and yet quite definitely beyond an age in which one changes so utterly, that amorphous, delicious mass, still wholly infantine, of little girls who, only a few years back, might have been seen sitting in a ring on the sand round a tent; a sort of white and vague constellation in which one would have distinguished a pair of eyes that sparkled more than the rest, a mischievous face, flaxen hair, only to lose them again and to confound them almost at once in the indistinct and milky nebula

   No doubt, in those earlier years that were still so recent, it was not, as it had been yesterday when they appeared for the first time before me, one’s impression of the group, but the group itself that had been lacking in clearness. Then those children, mere babies, had been still at that elementary stage in their formation when personality has not set its seal on every face. Like those primitive organisms in which the individual barely exists by itself, consists in the reef rather than in the coral insects that compose it, they were still pressed one against another. Sometimes one pushed her neighbour over, and then a wild laugh, which seemed the sole manifestation of their personal life, convulsed them all at once, obliterating, confounding those indefinite, grinning faces in the congealment of a single cluster, scintillating and tremulous. In an old photograph of themselves, which they were one day to give me, and which I have kept ever since, their infantile troop already presents the same number of participants as, later, their feminine procession; one can see from it that their presence must, even then, have made on the beach an unusual mark which forced itself on the attention; but one cannot recognise them individually in it save by a process of reasoning, leaving a clear field to all the transformations possible during girlhood, up to the point at which one reconstructed form would begin to encroach upon another individuality, which must be identified also, and whose handsome face, owing to the accessories of a large build and curly hair, may quite possibly have been, once, that wizened and impish little grin which the photograph album presents to us; and the distance traversed in a short interval of time by the physical characteristics of each of these girls making of them a criterion too vague to be of any use, whereas what they had in common and, so to speak, collectively, had at that early date been strongly marked, it sometimes happened that even their most intimate friends mistook one for another in this photograph, so much so that the question could in the last resort be settled only by some detail of costume which one of them could be certain that she herself, and not any of the others, had worn. Since those days, so different from the day on which I had just seen them strolling along the ‘front,’ so different and yet so close in time, they still gave way to fits of laughter, as I had observed that afternoon, but to laughter of a kind that was no longer the intermittent and almost automatic laughter of childhood, a spasmodic discharge which, in those days, had continually sent their heads dipping out of the circle, as the clusters of minnows in the Vivonne used to scatter and vanish only to gather again a moment later; each countenance was now mistress of itself, their eyes were fixed on the goal towards which they were marching; and it had taken, yesterday, the indecision and tremulousness of my first impression to make me confuse vaguely (as their childish hilarity and the old photograph had confused) the spores now individualised and disjoined of the pale madrepore

   Repeatedly, I dare say, when pretty girls went by, I had promised myself that I would see them again. As a rule, people do not appear a second time; moreover our memory, which speedily forgets their existence, would find it difficult to recall their appearance; our eyes would not recognise them, perhaps, and in the meantime we have seen new girls go by, whom we shall not see again either. But at other times, and this was what was to happen with the pert little band at Balbec, chance brings them back insistently before our eyes. Chance seems to us then a good and useful thing, for we discern in it as it were rudiments of organisation, of an attempt to arrange our life; and it makes easy to us, inevitable, and sometimes — after interruptions that have made us hope that we may cease to remember — cruel, the retention in our minds of images to the possession of which we shall come in time to believe that we were predestined, and which but for chance we should from the very first have managed to forget, like so many others, with so little difficulty

   Presently Saint-Loup’s visit drew to an end. I had not seen that party of girls again on the beach. He was too little at Balbec in the afternoons to have time to bother about them, or to attempt, in my interest, to make their acquaintance. In the evenings he was more free, and continued to take me constantly to Rivebelle. There are, in those restaurants, as there are in public gardens and railway trains, people embodied in a quite ordinary appearance, whose name astonishes us when, having happened to ask it, we discover that this is not the mere inoffensive stranger whom we supposed but nothing less than the Minister or Duke of whom we have so often heard. Two or three times already, in the Rivebelle restaurant, we had — Saint-Loup and I— seen come in and sit down at a table when everyone else was getting ready to go, a man of large stature, very muscular, with regular features and a grizzled beard, gazing, with concentrated attention, into the empty air. One evening, on our asking the landlord who was this obscure, solitary and belated diner, “What!” he exclaimed, “do you mean to say you don’t know the famous painter Elstir?” Swann had once mentioned his name to me, I had entirely forgotten in what connexion; but the omission of a particular memory, like that of part of a sentence when we are reading, leads sometimes not to uncertainty but to a birth of certainty that is premature. “He is a friend of Swann, a very well known artist, extremely good,” I told Saint-Loup. Whereupon there passed over us both, like a wave of emotion, the thought that Elstir was a great artist, a celebrated man, and that, confounding us with the rest of the diners, he had no suspicion of the ecstasy into which we were thrown by the idea of his talent. Doubtless, his unconsciousness of our admiration and of our acquaintance with Swann would not have troubled us had we not been at the seaside. But since we were still at an age when enthusiasm cannot keep silence, and had been transported into a life in which not to be known is unendurable, we wrote a letter, signed with both our names, in which we revealed to Elstir in the two diners seated within a few feet of him two passionate admirers of his talent, two friends of his great friend Swann, and asked to be allowed to pay our homage to him in person. A waiter undertook to convey this missive to the celebrity

   A celebrity Elstir was, perhaps, not yet at this period quite to the extent claimed by the landlord, though he was to reach the height of his fame within a very few years. But he had been one of the first to frequent this restaurant when it was still only a sort of farmhouse, and had brought to it a whole colony of artists (who had all, as it happened, migrated elsewhere as soon as the farm-yard in which they used to feed in the open air, under a lean-to roof, had become a fashionable centre); Elstir himself had returned to Rivebelle this evening only on account of a temporary absence of his wife, from the house which he had taken in the neighbourhood. But great talent, even when its existence is not yet recognised, will inevitably provoke certain phenomena of admiration, such as the landlord had managed to detect in the questions asked by more than one English lady visitor, athirst for information as to the life led by Elstir, or in the number of letters that he received from abroad. Then the landlord had further remarked that Elstir did not like to be disturbed when he was working, that he would rise in the middle of the night and take a little model down to the water’s edge to pose for him, nude, if the moon was shining; and had told himself that so much labour was not in vain, nor the admiration of the tourists unjustified when he had, in one of Elstir’s pictures, recognised a wooden cross which stood by the roadside as you came into Rivebelle

    “It’s all right!” he would repeat with stupefaction, “there are all the four beams! Oh, he does take a lot of trouble!”

   And he did not know whether a little Sunrise Over the Sea which Elstir had given him might not be worth a fortune

   We watched him read our letter, put it in his pocket, finish his dinner, begin to ask for his things, get up to go; and we were so convinced that we had shocked him by our overture that we would now have hoped (as keenly as at first we had dreaded) to make our escape without his noticing us. We did not bear in mind for a single instant a consideration which should, nevertheless, have seemed to us most important, namely that our enthusiasm for Elstir, on the sincerity of which we should not have allowed the least doubt to be cast, which we could indeed have supported with the evidence of our breathing arrested by expectancy, our desire to do no matter what that was difficult or heroic for the great man, was not, as we imagined it to be, admiration, since neither of us had ever seen anything that he had painted; our feeling might have as its object the hollow idea of a ‘great artist,’ but not a body of work which was unknown to us. It was, at the most, admiration in the abstract, the nervous envelope, the sentimental structure of an admiration without content, that is to say a thing as indissolubly attached to boyhood as are certain organs which have ceased to exist in the adult man; we were still boys. Elstir meanwhile was reaching the door when suddenly he turned and came towards us. I was transported by a delicious thrill of terror such as I could not have felt a few years later, because, while age diminishes our capacity, familiarity with the world has meanwhile destroyed in us any inclination to provoke such strange encounters, to feel that kind of emotion

   In the course of the few words that Elstir had come back to say to us, sitting down at our table, he never gave any answer on the several occasions on which I spoke to him of Swann. I began to think that he did not know him. He asked me, nevertheless, to come and see him at his Balbec studio, an invitation which he did not extend to Saint-Loup, and which I had earned (as I might not, perhaps, from Swann’s recommendation, had Elstir been intimate with him, for the part played by disinterested motives is greater than we are inclined to think in people’s lives) by a few words which made him think that I was devoted to the arts. He lavished on me a friendliness which was as far above that of Saint-Loup as that was above the affability of a mere tradesman. Compared with that of a great artist, the friendliness of a great gentleman, charming as it may be, has the effect of an actor’s playing a part, of being feigned. Saint-Loup sought to please; Elstir loved to give, to give himself. Everything that he possessed, ideas, work, and the rest which he counted for far less, he would have given gladly to anyone who could understand him. But, failing society that was endurable, he lived in an isolation, with a savagery which fashionable people called pose and ill-breeding, public authorities a recalcitrant spirit, his neighbours madness, his family selfishness and pride

   And no doubt at first he had thought, even in his solitude, with enjoyment that, thanks to his work, he was addressing, in spite of distance, he was giving a loftier idea of himself, to those who had misunderstood or hurt him. Perhaps, in those days, he lived alone not from indifference but from love of his fellows, and, just as I had renounced Gilberte to appear to her again one day in more attractive colours, dedicated his work to certain people as a way of approaching them again, by which without actually seeing him they would be made to love him, admire him, talk about him; a renunciation is not always complete from the start, when we decide upon it in our original frame of mind and before it has reacted upon us, whether it be the renunciation of an invalid, a monk, an artist or a hero. But if he had wished to produce with certain people in his mind, in producing he had lived for himself, remote from the society to which he had become indifferent; the practice of solitude had given him a love for it, as happens with every big thing which we have begun by fearing, because we knew it to be incompatible with smaller things to which we clung, and of which it does not so much deprive us as it detaches us from them. Before we experience it, our whole preoccupation is to know to what extent we can reconcile it with certain pleasures which cease to be pleasures as soon as we have experienced it

   Elstir did not stay long talking to us. I made up my mind that I would go to his studio during the next few days, but on the following afternoon, when I had accompanied my grandmother right to the point at which the ‘front’ ended, near the cliffs of Canapville, on our way back, at the foot of one of the little streets which ran down at right angles to the beach, we came upon a girl who, with lowered head like an animal that is being driven reluctant to its stall, and carrying golf-clubs, was walking in front of a person in authority, in all probability her or her friends’ ‘Miss,’ who suggested a portrait of Jeffreys by Hogarth, with a face as red as if her favourite beverage were gin rather than tea, on which a dried smear of tobacco at the corner of her mouth prolonged the curve of a moustache that was grizzled but abundant. The girl who preceded her was like that one of the little band who, beneath a black polo-cap, had shewn in an inexpressive chubby face a pair of laughing eyes. Now, the girl who was now passing me had also a black polo-cap, but she struck me as being even prettier than the other, the line of her nose was straighter, the curve of nostril at its base fuller and more fleshy. Besides, the other had seemed a proud, pale girl, this one a child well-disciplined and of rosy complexion. And yet, as she was pushing a bicycle just like the other’s, and was wearing the same reindeer gloves, I concluded that the differences arose perhaps from the angle and circumstances in which I now saw her, for it was hardly likely that there could be at Balbec a second girl, with a face that, when all was said, was so similar and with the same details in her accoutrements. She cast a rapid glance in my direction; for the next few days, when I saw the little band again on the beach, and indeed long afterwards when I knew all the girls who composed it, I could never be absolutely certain that any of them — even she who among them all was most like her, the girl with the bicycle — was indeed the one that I had seen that evening at the end of the ‘front,’ where a street ran down to the beach, a girl who differed hardly at all, but was still just perceptibly different from her whom I had noticed in the procession

   From that moment, whereas for the last few days my mind had been occupied chiefly by the tall one, it was the one with the golf-clubs, presumed to be Mlle. Simonet, who began once more to absorb my attention. When walking with the others she would often stop, forcing her friends, who seemed greatly to respect her, to stop also. Thus it is, calling a halt, her eyes sparkling beneath her polo-cap, that I see her again to-day, outlined against the screen which the sea spreads out behind her, and separated from me by a transparent, azure space, the interval of time that has elapsed since then, a first impression, faint and fine in my memory, desired, pursued, then forgotten, then found again, of a face which I have many times since projected upon the cloud of the past to be able to say to myself, of a girl who was actually in my room: “It is she!” But it was perhaps yet another, the one with geranium cheeks and green eyes, whom I should have liked most to know. And yet, whichever of them it might be, on any given day, that I preferred to see, the others, without her, were sufficient to excite my desire which, concentrated now chiefly on one, now on another, continued — as, on the first day, my confused vision — to combine and blend them, to make of them the little world apart, animated by a life in common, which for that matter they doubtless imagined themselves to form; and I should have penetrated, in becoming a friend of one of them — like a cultivated pagan or a meticulous Christian going among barbarians — into a rejuvenating society in which reigned health, unconsciousness of others, sensual pleasures, cruelty, unintellectuality and joy

   My grandmother, who had been told of my meeting with Elstir, and rejoiced at the thought of all the intellectual profit that I might derive from his friendship, considered it absurd and none too polite of me not to have gone yet to pay him a visit. But I could think only of the little band, and being uncertain of the hour at which the girls would be passing along the front, I dared not absent myself. My grandmother was astonished, too, at the smartness of my attire, for I had suddenly remembered suits which had been lying all this time at the bottom of my trunk. I put on a different one every day, and had even written to Paris ordering new hats and neckties

   It adds a great charm to life in a watering-place like Balbec if the face of a pretty girl, a vendor of shells, cakes or flowers, painted in vivid colours in our mind, is regularly, from early morning, the purpose of each of those leisured, luminous days which we spend upon the beach. They become then, and for that reason, albeit unoccupied by any business, as alert as working-days, pointed, magnetised, raised slightly to meet an approaching moment, that in which, while we purchase sand-cakes, roses, ammonites, we will delight in seeing upon a feminine face its colours displayed as purely as on a flower. But at least, with these little traffickers, first of all we can speak to them, which saves us from having to construct with our imagination their aspects other than those with which the mere visual perception of them furnishes us, and to recreate their life, magnifying its charm, as when we stand before a portrait; moreover, just because we speak to them, we can learn where and at what time it will be possible to see them again. Now I had none of these advantages with respect to the little band. Their habits were unknown to me; when on certain days I failed to catch a glimpse of them, not knowing the cause of their absence I sought to discover whether it was something fixed and regular, if they were to be seen only every other day, or in certain states of the weather, or if there were days on which no one ever saw them. I imagined myself already friends with them, and saying: “But you weren’t there the other day?” “Weren’t we? Oh, no, of course not; that was because it was a Saturday. On Saturdays we don’t ever come, because . . . ” If it were only as simple as that, to know that on black Saturday it was useless to torment oneself, that one might range the beach from end to end, sit down outside the pastry-cook’s and pretend to be nibbling an éclair, poke into the curiosity shop, wait for bathing time, the concert, high tide, sunset, night, all without seeing the longed-for little band. But the fatal day did not, perhaps, come once a week. It did not, perhaps, of necessity fall on Saturdays. Perhaps certain atmospheric conditions influenced it or were entirely unconnected with it. How many observations, patient but not at all serene, must one accumulate of the movements, to all appearance irregular, of those unknown worlds before being able to be sure that one has not allowed oneself to be led astray by mere coincidence, that one’s forecasts will not be proved wrong, before one elucidates the certain laws, acquired at the cost of so much painful experience, of that passionate astronomy. Remembering that I had not yet seen them on some particular day of the week, I assured myself that they would not be coming, that it was useless to wait any longer on the beach. And at that very moment I caught sight of them. And yet on another day which, so far as I could suppose that there were laws that guided the return of those constellations, must, I had calculated, prove an auspicious day, they did not come. But to this primary uncertainty whether I should see them or not that day, there was added another, more disquieting: whether I should ever set eyes on them again, for I had no reason, after all, to know that they were not about to sail for America, or to return to Paris. This was enough to make me begin to love them. One can feel an attraction towards a particular person. But to release that fount of sorrow, that sense of the irreparable, those agonies which prepare the way for love, there must be — and this is, perhaps, more than any person can be, the actual object which our passion seeks so anxiously to embrace — the risk of an impossibility. Thus there were acting upon me already those influences which recur in the course of our successive love-affairs, which can, for that matter, be provoked (but then rather in the life of cities) by the thought of little working girls whose half-holiday is we know not on what day, and whom we are afraid of having missed as they came out of the factory; or which at least have recurred in mine. Perhaps they are inseparable from love; perhaps everything that formed a distinctive feature of our first love attaches itself to those that come after, by recollection, suggestion, habit, and through the successive periods of our life gives to its different aspects a general character

   I seized every pretext for going down to the beach at the hours when I hoped to succeed in finding them there. Having caught sight of them once while we were at luncheon, I now invariably came in late for it, waiting interminably upon the ‘front’ for them to pass; devoting all the short time that I did spend in the dining-room to interrogating with my eyes its azure wall of glass; rising long before the dessert, so as not to miss them should they have gone out at a different hour, and chafing with irritation at my grandmother, when, with unwitting malevolence, she made me stay with her past the hour that seemed to me propitious. I tried to prolong the horizon by setting my chair aslant; if, by chance, I did catch sight of no matter which of the girls, since they all partook of the same special essence, it was as if I had seen projected before my face in a shifting, diabolical hallucination, a little of the unfriendly and yet passionately coveted dream which, but a moment ago, had existed only — where it lay stagnant for all time — in my brain

   I was in love with none of them, loving them all, and yet the possibility of meeting them was in my daily life the sole element of delight, alone made to burgeon in me those high hopes by which every obstacle is surmounted, hopes ending often in fury if I had not seen them. For the moment, these girls eclipsed my grandmother in my affection; the longest journey would at once have seemed attractive to me had it been to a place in which they might be found. It was to them that my thoughts comfortably clung when I supposed myself to be thinking of something else or of nothing. But when, even without knowing it, I thought of them, they, more unconsciously still, were for me the mountainous blue undulations of the sea, a troop seen passing in outline against the waves. Our most intensive love for a person is always the love, really, of something else as well

   Meanwhile my grandmother was shewing, because now I was keenly interested in golf and lawn-tennis and was letting slip an opportunity of seeing at work and hearing talk an artist whom she knew to be one of the greatest of his time, a disapproval which seemed to me to be based on somewhat narrow views. I had guessed long ago in the Champs-Elysées, and had since established to my own satisfaction, that when we are in love with a woman we simply project into her a state of our own soul, that the important thing is, therefore, not the worth of the woman but the depth of the state; and that the emotions which a young girl of no kind of distinction arouses in us can enable us to bring to the surface of our consciousness some of the most intimate parts of our being, more personal, more remote, more essential than would be reached by the pleasure that we derive from the conversation of a great man or even from the admiring contemplation of his work

   I was to end by complying with my grandmother’s wishes, all the more reluctantly in that Elstir lived at some distance from the ‘front’ in one of the newest of Balbec’s avenues. The heat of the day obliged me to take the tramway which passed along the Rue de la Plage, and I made an effort (so as still to believe that I was in the ancient realm of the Cimmerians, in the country it might be, of King Mark, or upon the site of the Forest of Broceliande) not to see the gimcrack splendour of the buildings that extended on either hand, among which Elstir’s villa was perhaps the most sumptuously hideous, in spite of which he had taken it, because, of all that there were to be had at Balbec, it was the only one that provided him with a really big studio

   It was also with averted eyes that I crossed the garden, which had a lawn — in miniature, like any little suburban villa round Paris — a statuette of an amorous gardener, glass balls in which one saw one’s distorted reflexion, beds of begonias and a little arbour, beneath which rocking chairs were drawn up round an iron table. But after all these preliminaries hallmarked with philistine ugliness, I took no notice of the chocolate mouldings on the plinths once I was in the studio; I felt perfectly happy, for, with the help of all the sketches and studies that surrounded me, I foresaw the possibility of raising myself to a poetical understanding, rich in delights, of many forms which I had not, hitherto, isolated from the general spectacle of reality. And Elstir’s studio appeared to me as the laboratory of a sort of new creation of the world in which, from the chaos that is all the things we see, he had extracted, by painting them on various rectangles of canvas that were hung everywhere about the room, here a wave of the sea crushing angrily on the sand its lilac foam, there a young man in a suit of white linen, leaning upon the rail of a vessel. His jacket and the spattering wave had acquired fresh dignity from the fact that they continued to exist, even although they were deprived of those qualities in which they might be supposed to consist, the wave being no longer able to splash nor the jacket to clothe anyone

   At the moment at which I entered, the creator was just finishing, with the brush which he had in his hand, the form of the sun at its setting

   The shutters were closed almost everywhere round the studio, which was fairly cool and, except in one place where daylight laid against the wall its brilliant but fleeting decoration, dark; there was open only one little rectangular window embowered in honeysuckle, which, over a strip of garden, gave on an avenue; so that the atmosphere of the greater part of the studio was dusky, transparent and compact in the mass, but liquid and sparkling at the rifts where the golden clasp of sunlight banded it, like a lump of rock crystal of which one surface, already cut and polished, here and there, gleams like a mirror with iridescent rays. While Elstir, at my request, went on painting, I wandered about in the half-light, stopping to examine first one picture, then another

   Most of those that covered the walls were not what I should chiefly have liked to see of his work, paintings in what an English art journal which lay about on the reading-room table in the Grand Hotel called his first and second manners, the mythological manner and the manner in which he shewed signs of Japanese influence, both admirably exemplified, the article said, in the collection of Mme. de Guermantes. Naturally enough, what he had in his studio were almost all seascapes done here, at Balbec. But I was able to discern from these that the charm of each of them lay in a sort of metamorphosis of the things represented in it, analogous to what in poetry we call metaphor, and that, if God the Father had created things by naming them, it was by taking away their names or giving them other names that Elstir created them anew. The names which denote things correspond invariably to an intellectual notion, alien to our true impressions, and compelling us to eliminate from them everything that is not in keeping with itself

   Sometimes in my window in the hotel at Balbec, in the morning when Françoise undid the fastenings of the curtains that shut out the light, in the evening when I was waiting until it should be time to go out with Saint-Loup, I had been led by some effect of sunlight to mistake what was only a darker stretch of sea for a distant coastline, or to gaze at a belt of liquid azure without knowing whether it belonged to sea or sky. But presently my reason would re-establish between the elements that distinction which in my first impression I had overlooked. In the same way I used, in Paris, in my bedroom, to hear a dispute, almost a. riot, in the street below, until I had referred back to its cause — a carriage for instance that was rattling towards me — this noise, from which I now eliminated the shrill and discordant vociferations which my ear had really heard but which my reason knew that wheels did not produce. But the rare moments in which we see nature as she is, with poetic vision, it was from those that Elstir’s work was taken. One of his metaphors that occurred most commonly in the seascapes which he had round him was precisely that which, comparing land with sea, suppressed every line of demarcation between them. It was this comparison, tacitly and untiringly repeated on a single canvas, which gave it that multiform and powerful unity, the cause (not always clearly perceived by themselves) of the enthusiasm which Elstir’s work aroused in certain collectors

   It was, for instance, for a metaphor of this sort — in a picture of the harbour of Carquethuit, a picture which he had finished a few days earlier and at which I now stood gazing my fill — that Elstir had prepared the mind of the spectator by employing, for the little town, only marine terms, and urban terms for the sea. Whether its houses concealed a part of the harbour, a dry dock, or perhaps the sea itself came cranking in among the land, as constantly happened on the Balbec coast, on the other side of the promontory on which the town was built the roofs were overtopped (as it had been by mill-chimneys or church-steeples) by masts which had the effect of making the vessels to which they belonged appear town-bred, built on land, an impression which was strengthened by the sight of other boats, moored along the jetty but in such serried ranks that you could see men talking across from one deck to another without being able to distinguish the dividing line, the chink of water between them, so that this fishing fleet seemed less to belong to the water than, for instance, the churches of Criquebec which, in the far distance, surrounded by water on every side because you saw them without seeing the town, in a powdery haze of sunlight and crumbling waves, seemed to be emerging from the waters, blown in alabaster or in sea-foam, and, enclosed in the band of a particoloured rainbow, to form an unreal, a mystical picture. On the beach in the foreground the painter had arranged that the eye should discover no fixed boundary, no absolute line of demarcation between earth and ocean. The men who were pushing down their boats into the sea were running as much through the waves as along the sand, which, being wet, reflected their hulls as if they were already in the water. The sea itself did not come up in an even line but followed the irregularities of the shore, which the perspective of the picture increased still further, so that a ship actually at sea, half-hidden by the projecting works of the arsenal, seemed to be sailing across the middle of the town; women who were gathering shrimps among the rocks had the appearance, because they were surrounded by water and because of the depression which, after the ringlike barrier of rocks, brought the beach (on the side nearest the land) down to sea-level, of being in a marine grotto overhung by ships and waves, open yet unharmed in the path of a miraculously averted tide. If the whole picture gave this impression of harbours in which the sea entered into the land, in which the land was already subaqueous and the population amphibian, the strength of the marine element was everywhere apparent; and round about the rocks, at the mouth of the harbour, where the sea was rough, you felt from the muscular efforts of the fishermen and the obliquity of the boats leaning over at an acute angle, compared with the calm erect-ness of the warehouse on the harbour, the church, the houses of the town to which some of the figures were returning while others were coming out to fish, that they were riding bareback on the water, as it might be a swift and fiery animal whose rearing, but for their skill, must have unseated them. A party of holiday makers were putting gaily out to sea in a boat that tossed like a jaunting-car on a rough road; their boatman, blithe but attentive, also, to what he was doing, trimmed the bellying sail, every one kept in his place, so that the weight should not be all on one side of the boat, which might capsize, and so they went racing over sunlit fields into shadowy places, dashing down into the troughs of waves. It was a fine morning in spite of the recent storm. Indeed, one could still feel the powerful activities that must first be neutralized in order to attain the easy balance of the boats that lay motionless, enjoying sunshine and breeze, in parts where the sea was so calm that its reflexions had almost more solidity and reality than the floating hulls, vaporised by an effect of the sunlight, parts which the perspective of the picture dovetailed in among others. Or rather you would not have called them other parts of the sea. For between those parts there was as much difference as there was between one of them and the church rising from the water, or the ships behind the town. Your reason then set to work and made a single element of what was here black beneath a gathering storm, a little farther all of one colour with the sky and as brightly burnished, and elsewhere so bleached by sunshine, haze and foam, so compact, so terrestrial, so circumscribed with houses that you thought of some white stone causeway or of a field of snow, up the surface of which it was quite frightening to see a ship go climbing high and dry, as a carriage climbs dripping from a ford, but which a moment later, when you saw on the raised and broken surface of the solid plain boats drunkenly heaving, you understood, identical in all these different aspects, to be still the sea

   Although we are justified in saying that there can be no progress, no discovery in art, but only in the sciences, and that the artist who begins afresh upon his own account an individual effort cannot be either helped or hindered by the efforts of all the others, we must nevertheless admit that, in so far as art brings into prominence certain laws, once an industry has taken those laws and vulgarised them, the art that was first in the field loses, in retrospect, a little of its originality. Since Elstir began to paint, we have grown familiar with what are called ‘admirable’ photographs of scenery and towns. If we press for a definition of what their admirers mean by the epithet, we shall find that it is generally applied to some unusual picture of a familiar object, a picture different from those that we are accustomed to see, unusual and yet true to nature, and for that reason doubly impressive to us because it startles us, makes us emerge from our habits and at the same time brings us back to ourselves by recalling to us an earlier impression. For instance, one of these ‘magnificent’ photographs will illustrate a law of perspective, will shew us some cathedral which we are accustomed to see in the middle of a town, taken instead from a selected point of view from which it will appear to be thirty times the height of the houses and to be thrusting a spur out from the bank of the river, from which it is actually a long way off. Now the effort made by Elstir to reproduce things not as he knew them to be but according to the optical illusions of which our first sight of them is composed, had led him exactly to this point; he gave special emphasis to certain of these laws of perspective, which were thus all the more striking, since his art had been their first interpreter. A river, because of the windings of its course, a bay because of the apparent contact of the cliffs on either side of it, would look as though there had been hollowed out in the heart of the plain or of the mountains a lake absolutely landlocked on every side. In a picture of a view from Balbec painted upon a scorching day in summer an inlet of the sea appeared to be enclosed in walls of pink granite, not to be the sea, which began farther out. The continuity of the ocean was suggested only by the gulls which, wheeling over what, when one looked at the picture, seemed to be solid rock, were as a matter of fact inhaling the moist vapour of the shifting tide. Other laws were discernible in the same canvas, as, at the foot of immense cliffs, the lilliputian grace of white sails on the blue mirror on whose surface they looked like butterflies asleep, and certain contrasts between the depth of the shadows and the pallidity of the light. This play of light and shade, which also photography has rendered commonplace, had interested Elstir so much that at one time he had painted what were almost mirages, in which a castle crowned with a tower appeared as a perfect circle of castle prolonged by a tower at its summit, and at its foot by an inverted tower, whether because the exceptional purity of the atmosphere on a fine day gave the shadow reflected in the water the hardness and brightness of the stone, or because the morning mists rendered the stone as vaporous as the shadow. And similarly, beyond the sea, behind a line of woods, began another sea roseate with the light of the setting sun, which was, in fact, the sky. The light, as it were precipitating new solids, thrust back the hull of the boat on which it fell behind the other hull that was still in shadow, and rearranged like the steps of a crystal staircase what was materially a plane surface, but was broken up by the play of light and shade upon the morning sea. A river running beneath the bridges of a town was caught from a certain point of view so that it appeared entirely dislocated, now broadened into a lake, now narrowed into a rivulet, broken elsewhere by the interruption of a hill crowned with trees among which the burgher would repair at evening to taste the refreshing breeze; and the rhythm of this disintegrated town was assured only by the inflexible uprightness of the steeples which did not rise but rather, following the plumb line of the pendulum marking its cadence as in a triumphal march, seemed to hold in suspense beneath them all the confused mass of houses that rose vaguely in the mist along the banks of the crushed, disjointed stream. And (since Elstir’s earliest work belonged to the time in which a painter would make his landscape attractive by inserting a human figure), on the cliff’s edge or among the mountains, the road, that half human part of nature, underwent, like river or ocean, the eclipses of perspective. And whether a sheer wall of mountain, or the mist blown from a torrent, or the sea prevented the eye from following the continuity of the path, visible to the traveller but not to us, the little human personage in old-fashioned attire seemed often to be stopped short on the edge of an abyss, the path which he had been following ending there, while, a thousand feet above him in those pine-forests, it was with a melting eye and comforted heart that we saw reappear the threadlike whiteness of its dusty surface, hospitable to the wayfaring foot, whereas from us the side of the mountain had hidden, where it turned to avoid waterfall or gully, the intervening bends

   The effort made by Elstir to strip himself, when face to face with reality, of every intellectual concept, was all the more admirable in that this man who, before sitting down to paint, made himself deliberately ignorant, forgot, in his honesty of purpose, everything that he knew, since what one knows ceases to exist by itself, had in reality an exceptionally cultivated mind. When I confessed to him the disappointment that I had felt upon seeing the porch at Balbec: “What!” he had exclaimed, “you were disappointed by the porch! Why, it’s the finest illustrated Bible that the people have ever had. That Virgin, and all the bas-reliefs telling the story of her life, they are the most loving, the most inspired expression of that endless poem of adoration and praise in which the middle ages extolled the glory of the Madonna. If you only knew, side by side with the most scrupulous accuracy in rendering the sacred text, what exquisite ideas the old carver had, what profound thoughts, what delicious poetry!

    “A wonderful idea, that great sheet in which the angels are carrying the body of the Virgin, too sacred for them to venture to touch it with their hands”; (I mentioned to him that this theme had been treated also at Saint-André-des-Champs; he had seen photographs of the porch there, and agreed, but pointed out that the bustling activity of those little peasant figures, all hurrying at once towards the Virgin, was not the same thing as the gravity of those two great angels, almost Italian, so springing, so gentle) “the angel who is carrying the Virgin’s soul, to reunite it with her body; in the meeting of the Virgin with Elizabeth, Elizabeth’s gestijre when she touches the Virgin’s Womb and marvels to feel that it is great with child; and the bandaged arm of the midwife who had refused, unless she touched, to believe the Immaculate Conception; and the linen cloth thrown by the Virgin to Saint Thomas to give him a proof of the Resurrection; that veil, too, which the Virgin tears from her own bosom to cover the nakedness of her Son, from Whose Side the Church receives in a chalice the Wine of the Sacrament, while, on His other side the Synagogue, whose kingdom is at an end, has its eyes bandaged, holds a half-broken sceptre and lets fall, with the crown that is slipping from its head, the tables of the old law; and the husband who, on the Day of Judgment, as he helps his young wife to rise from her grave, lays her hand against his own heart to reassure her, to prove to her that it is indeed beating, is that such a trumpery idea, do you think, so stale and commonplace? And the angel who is taking away the sun and the moon, henceforth useless, since it is written that the Light of the Cross shall be seven times brighter than the light of the firmament; and the one who is dipping his hand in the water of the Child’s bath, to see whether it is warm enough; and the one emerging from the clouds to place the crown upon the Virgin’s brow, and all the angels who are leaning from the vault of heaven, between the balusters of the New Jerusalem, and throwing up their arms with terror or joy at the sight of the torments of the wicked or the bliss of the elect! For it is all the circles of heaven, a whole gigantic poem full of theology and symbolism that you have before you there. It is fantastic, mad, divine, a thousand times better than anything you will see in Italy, where for that matter this very tympanum has been carefully copied by sculptors with far less genius. There never was a time when genius was universal; that is all nonsense; it would be going beyond the age of gold. The fellow who carved that front, you may make up your mind that he was every bit as great, that he had just as profound ideas as the men you admire most at the present day. I could shew you what I mean if we went there together. There are certain passages from the Office of the Assumption which have been rendered with a subtilty of expression that Redon himself has never equalled.”

   This vast celestial vision of which he spoke to me, this gigantic theological poem which, I understood, had been inscribed there in stone, yet when my eyes, big with desire, had opened to gaze upon the front of Balbec church, it was not these things that I had seen. I spoke to him of those great statues of saints, which, mounted on scaffolds, formed a sort of avenue on either side

    “It starts from the mists of antiquity to end in Jesus Christ,” he explained. “You see on one side His ancestors after the spirit, on the other the Kings of Judah, His ancestors after the flesh. All the ages are there. And if you had looked more closely at what you took for scaffolds you would have been able to give names to the figures standing on them. At the feet of Moses you would have recognised the calf of gold, at Abraham’s the ram and at Joseph’s the demon counselling Potiphar’s wife.”

   I told him also that I had gone there expecting to find an almost Persian building, and that this had doubtless been one of the chief factors in my disappointment. “Indeed, no,” he assured me, “it is perfectly true. Some parts of it are quite oriental; one of the capitals reproduces so exactly a Persian subject that you cannot account for it by the persistence of Oriental traditions. The carver must have copied some casket brought from the East by explorers.” And he did indeed shew me, later on, the photograph of a capital on which I saw dragons that were almost Chinese devouring one another, but at Balbec this little piece of carving had passed unnoticed by me in the general effect of the building which did not conform to the pattern traced in my mind by the words, ‘an almost Persian church.’

   The intellectual pleasures which I enjoyed in this studio did not in the least prevent me from feeling, although they enveloped us as it were in spite of ourselves, the warm polish, the sparkling gloom of the place itself and, through the little window framed in honeysuckle, in the avenue that was quite rustic, the resisting dryness of the sun-parched earth, screened only by the diaphanous gauze woven of distance and of a tree-cast shade. Perhaps the unaccountable feeling of comfort which this summer day was giving me came like a tributary to swell the flood of joy that had surged in me at the sight of Elstir’s Carquethuit Harbour.

   I had supposed Elstir to be a modest man, but I realised my mistake on seeing his face cloud with melancholy when, in a little speech of thanks, I uttered the word ‘fame.’ Men who believe that their work will last — as was the case with Elstir — form the habit of placing that work in a period when they themselves will have crumbled into dust. And thus, by obliging them to reflect on their own extinction, the thought of fame saddens them because it is inseparable from the thought of death. I changed the conversation in the hope of driving away the cloud of ambitious melancholy with which unwittingly I had loaded Elstir’s brow. “Some one advised me once,” I began, thinking of the conversation we had had with Legrandin at Combray, as to which I was glad of an opportunity of learning Elstir’s views, “not to visit Brittany, because it would not be wholesome for a mind with a natural tendency to dream.” “Not at all;” he replied. “When the mind has a tendency to dream, it is a mistake to keep dreams away from it, to ration its dreams. So long as you distract your mind from its dreams, it will not know them for what they are; you will always be being taken in by the appearance of things, because you will not have grasped their true nature. If a little dreaming is dangerous, the cure for it is not to dream less but to dream more, to dream all the time. One must have a thorough understanding of one’s dreams if one is not to be troubled by them; there is a way of separating one’s dreams from one’s life which so often produces good results that I ask myself whether one ought not, at all costs, to try it, simply as a preventive, just as certain surgeons make out that we ought, to avoid the risk of appendicitis later on, to have all our appendices taken out when we are children.”

   Elstir and I had meanwhile been walking about the studio, and had reached the window that looked across the garden on to a narrow avenue, a side-street that was almost a country lane. We had gone there to breathe the cooler air of the late afternoon. I supposed myself to be nowhere near the girls of the little band, and it was only by sacrificing for once the hope of seeing them that I had yielded to my grandmother’s prayers and had gone to see Elstir. For where the thing is to be found that we are seeking we never know, and often we steadily, for a long time, avoid the place to which, for quite different reasons, everyone has been asking us to go. But we never suspect that we shall there see the very person of whom we are thinking. I looked out vaguely over the country road which, outside the studio, passed quite close to it but did not belong to Elstir. Suddenly there appeared on it, coming along it at a rapid pace, the young bicyclist of the little band, with, over her dark hair, her polo-cap pulled down towards her plump cheeks, her eyes merry and almost importunate; and on that auspicious path, miraculously filled with promise of delights, I saw her beneath the trees throw to Elstir the smiling greeting of a friend, a rainbow that bridged the gulf for me between our terraqueous world and regions which I had hitherto regarded as inaccessible. She even came up to give her hand to the painter, though without stopping, and I could see that she had a tiny beauty spot on her chin. “Do you know that girl, sir?” I asked Elstir, realising that he could if he chose make me known to her, could invite us both to the house. And this peaceful studio with its rural horizon was at once filled with a surfeit of delight such as a child might feel in a house where he was already happily playing when he learned that, in addition, out of that bounteousness which enables lovely things and noble hosts to increase their gifts beyond all measure, there was being prepared for him a sumptuous repast. Elstir told me that she was called Albertine Simonet, and gave me the names also of her friends, whom I described to him with sufficient accuracy for him to identify them almost without hesitation. I had, with regard to their social position, made a mistake, but not the mistake that I usually made at Balbec. I was always ready to take for princes the sons of shopkeepers when they appeared on horseback. This time I had placed in an interloping class the daughters of a set of respectable people, extremely rich, belonging to the world of industry and business. It was the class which, on first thoughts, interested me least, since it held for me neither the mystery of the lower orders nor that of a society such as the Guermantes frequented. And no doubt if an inherent quality, a rank which they could never forfeit, had not been conferred on them, in my dazzled eyes, by the glaring vacuity of the seaside life all round them, I should perhaps not have succeeded in resisting and overcoming the idea that they were the daughters of prosperous merchants. I could not help marvelling to see how the French middle class was a wonderful studio full of sculpture of the noblest and most varied kind. What unimagined types, what richness of invention in the character of their faces, what firmness, what freshness, what simplicity in their features. The shrewd old moneychangers from whose loins these Dianas and these nymphs had sprung seemed to me to have been the greatest of statuaries. Before I had time to register the social metamorphosis of these girls — so are these discoveries of a mistake, these modifications of the notion one has of a person instantaneous as a chemical combination — there was already installed behind their faces, so street-arab in type that I had taken them for the mistresses of racing bicyclists, of boxing champions, the idea that they might easily be connected with the family of some lawyer or other whom we knew. I was barely conscious of what was meant by Albertine Simonet; she had certainly no conception of what she was one day to mean to me. Even the name, Simonet, which I had already heard spoken on the beach, if I had been asked to write it down I should have spelt with a double ‘n,’ never dreaming of the importance which this family attached to there being but one in their name. In proportion as we descend the social scale our snobbishness fastens on to mere nothings which are perhaps no more null than the distinctions observed by the aristocracy, but, being more obscure, more peculiar to the individual, take us more by surprise. Possibly there had been Simonnets who had done badly in business, or something worse still even. The fact remains that the Simonets never failed, it appeared, to be annoyed if anyone doubled their ‘n.’ They wore the air of being the only Simonets in the world with one ‘n’ instead of two, and were as proud of it, perhaps, as the Montmorency family were of being the premier barons of France. I asked Elstir whether these girls lived at Balbec; yes, he told me, some of them at any rate. The villa in which one of them lived was at that very spot, right at the end of the beach, where the cliffs of Canapville began. As this girl was a great friend of Albertine Simonet, this was another reason for me to believe that it was indeed the latter whom I had met that day when I was with my grandmother. There were of course so many of those little streets running down to the beach, and all at the same angle, that I could not have pointed out exactly which of them it had been. One would like always to remember a thing accurately, but at the time one’s vision was clouded. And yet that Albertine and the girl whom I had seen going to her friend’s house were one and the same person was a practical certainty. In spite of which, whereas the countless images that have since been furnished me by the dark young golfer, however different they may have been from one another, have overlaid one another (because I now know that they all belong to her), and if I retrace the thread of my memories I can, under cover of that identity, and as though along a tunnelled passage, pass through all those images in turn without losing my consciousness of the same person behind them all, if, on the other hand, I wish to revert to the girl whom I passed that day when I was with my grandmother, I must escape first into freer air. I am convinced that it is Albertine whom I find there, the same girl as her who would often stop dead among her moving comrades, in her walk along the foreground of the sea; but all those more recent images remain separate from that earlier one because I am unable to confer on her retrospectively an identity which she had not for me at the moment in which she caught my eye; whatever assurance I may derive from the law of probabilities, that girl with plump cheeks who stared at me so boldly from the angle of the little street and the beach, and by whom I believe that I might have been loved, I have never, in the strict sense of the words, seen again

   My hesitation between the different girls of the little band, all of whom retained something of the collective charm which had at first disturbed me, combined with the reasons already given to allow me later on, even at the time of my greater — my second — passion for Albertine, a sort of intermittent and very brief liberty to abstain from loving her. From having strayed among all her friends before it finally concentrated itself on her, my love kept, now and then, between itself and the image of Albertine a certain ‘play’ of light and shade which enabled it, like a badly fitted lamp, to flit over the surface of each of the others before settling its focus upon her; the connexion between the pain which I felt in my heart and the memory of Albertine did not seem to me necessary; I might perhaps have managed to co-ordinate it with the image of another person, Which enabled me, in a momentary flash, to banish reality altogether, not only external reality, as in my love for Gilberte (which I had recognised to be an internal state in which I drew from myself alone the particular quality, the special character of the person whom I loved, everything that rendered her indispensable to my happiness), but even the other reality, internal and purely subjective

    “Not a day passes but one or the other of them comes by here, and looks in for a minute or two,” Elstir told me, plunging me in despair when I thought that if I had gone to see him at once, when my grandmother had begged me to do so, I should, in all probability, long since have made Albertine’s acquaintance

   She had passed on; from the studio she was no longer in sight. I supposed that she had gone to join her friends on the ‘front.’ Could I have appeared there suddenly with Elstir, I should have got to know them all. I thought of endless pretexts for inducing him to take a turn with me on the beach. I had no longer the same peace of mind as before the apparition of the girl in the frame of the little window; so charming until then in its fringe of honeysuckle, and now so drearily empty. Elstir caused me a joy that was tormenting also when he said that he would go a little way with me, but that he must first finish the piece of work on which he was engaged. It was a flower study but not one of any of the flowers, portraits of which I would rather have commissioned him to paint than the portrait of a person, so that I might learn from the revelation of his genius what I had so often sought in vain from the flowers themselves — hawthorn white and pink, cornflowers, apple-blossom. Elstir as he worked talked botany to me, but I scarcely listened; he was no longer sufficient in himself, he was now only the necessary intermediary between these girls and me; the distinction which, only a few moments ago, his talent had still given him in my eyes was now worthless save in so far as it might confer a little on me also in the eyes of the little band to whom I should be presented by him

   I paced up and down the room, impatient for him to finish what he was doing; I picked up and examined various sketches, any number of which were stacked against the walls. In this way I happened to bring to light a water-colour which evidently belonged to a much earlier period in Elstir’s life, and gave me that particular kind of enchantment which is diffused by works of art not only deliriously executed but representing a subject so singular and so seductive that it is to it that we attribute a great deal of their charm, as if the charm were something that the painter had merely to uncover, to observe, realised already in a material form by nature, and to reproduce in art. That such objects can exist, beautiful quite apart from the painter’s interpretation of them, satisfies a sort of innate materialism in us, against which our reason contends and acts as a counterpoise to the abstractions of aesthetics. It was — this water-colour — the portrait of a young woman, by no means beautiful but of a curious type, in a close-fitting mob-cap not unlike a ‘billy-cock’ hat, trimmed with a ribbon of cherry-coloured silk; in one of her mittened hands was a lighted cigarette, while the other held, level with her knee, a sort of broad-brimmed garden hat, nothing more than a fire screen of plaited straw to keep off the sun. On a table by her side, a tall vase filled with pink carnations. Often (and it was the case here) the singularity of such works is due principally to their having been executed in special conditions for which we do not at first sight make proper allowance, if, for instance, the strange attire of a feminine model is her costume for a masked ball, or conversely the scarlet cloak which an elderly man looks as though he had put on to humour some whim in the painter is his gown as a professor or alderman or his cardinal’s cassock. The ambiguous character of the person whose portrait now confronted me arose, without my understanding it, from the fact that she was a young actress of an earlier generation half dressed for a part. But the cap or hat, beneath which the hair stuck out but was cut short, the velvet coat opening without lapels over a white shirt-front, made me hesitate as to the period of the clothes and the sex of the model, so that I did not know what it was exactly that I was holding before my eyes, unless simply the brightest coloured of these scraps of painting. And the pleasure which it afforded me was disturbed only by the fear that Elstir, by delaying further, would make me miss the girls, for the sun was now declining and hung low in the little window. Nothing in this water-colour was merely stated there as a fact and painted because of its utility to the composition, the costume because the young woman must be wearing something, the vase to hold the flowers. The glass of the vase, cherished for its own sake, seemed to be holding the water in which the stems of the carnations were dipped in something as limpid, almost as liquid as itself; the woman’s dress encompassed her in a manner that had an independent, a brotherly charm, and, if the works of man can compete in charm with the wonders of nature, as delicate, as pleasing to the touch of the eye, as freshly painted as the fur of a cat, the petals of a flower, the feathers of a dove. The whiteness of the shirt-front, fine as driven rain, with its gay pleats gathered into little bells like lilies of the valley, was starred with bright gleams of light from the room, as sharply edged and as finely shaded as though they had been posies of flowers stitched on the woven lawn. And the velvet of the coat, brilliant with a milky sheen, had here and there a roughness, a scoring, a shagginess on its surface which made one think of the crumpled brightness of the carnations in the vase. But above all one felt that Elstir, sublimely indifferent to whatever immoral suggestion there might be in this disguise of a young actress for whom the talent with which she would play her part on the stage was doubtless of less importance than the irritant attraction which she would offer to the jaded or depraved senses of some of her audience, had on the contrary fastened upon those ambiguous points as on an aesthetic element which deserved to be brought into prominence, and which he had done everything in his power to emphasise. Along the lines of the face, the latent sex seemed to be on the point of confessing itself to be that of a somewhat boyish girl, then vanished and farther on reappeared with a suggestion rather of an effeminate youth, vicious and pensive, then fled once more to remain uncapturable. The dreamy sadness in the expression of her eyes, by the mere fact of its contrast with the accessories belonging to the world of love-making and play-acting, was not the least disturbing element in the picture. One imagined moreover that it must be feigned, and that the young person who seemed ready to submit to caresses in this provoking costume had probably thought it effective to enhance the provocation with this romantic expression of a secret longing, an unspoken grief. At the foot of the picture was inscribed “Miss Sacripant: October, 1872.” I could not contain my admiration. “Oh, it’s nothing, only a rough sketch I did when I was young; it was a costume for a variety show. It’s all ages ago now.” “And what has become of the model?” A bewilderment provoked by my words preceded on Elstir’s face the indifferent, absent-minded air which, a moment later, he displayed there. “Quick, give it to me!” he cried, “I hear Madame Elstir coming, and, though, I assure you, the young person in the billy-cock hat never played any part in my life, still there’s no point in my wife’s coming in and finding it staring her in the face. I have kept it only as an amusing sidelight on the theatre of those days.” And, before putting it away behind the pile, Elstir, who perhaps had not set eyes on the sketch for years, gave it his careful scrutiny. “I must keep just the head,” he murmured, “the lower part is really too shockingly bad, the hands are a beginner’s work.” I was miserable at the arrival of Mme. Elstir, who could only delay us still further. The window sill was already aglow. Our excursion would be a pure waste of time. There was no longer the slightest chance of our seeing the girls, consequently it mattered now not at all how soon Mme. Elstir left us or how long she stayed. Not that she did stay for any length of time. I found her most tedious; she might have been beautiful, once, at twenty, driving an ox in the Roman Campagna, but her dark hair was streaked with grey and she was common without being simple, because she believed that a pompous manner and majestic attitudes were required by her statuesque beauty, which, however, advancing age had robbed of all its charm. She was dressed with the utmost simplicity. And it was touching, but at the same time surprising to hear Elstir, whenever he opened his mouth, and with a respectful gentleness, as if merely uttering the words moved him to tenderness and veneration, repeat: “My beautiful Gabrielle!” Later on, when I had become familiar with Elstir’s mythological paintings, Mme. Elstir acquired beauty in my eyes also. I understood then that to a certain ideal type illustrated by certain lines, certain arabesques which reappeared incessantly throughout his work, to a certain canon of art he had attributed a character that was almost divine, since the whole of his time, all the mental effort of which he was capable, in a word his whole life he had consecrated to the task of distinguishing those lines as clearly and of reproducing them as faithfully as possible. What such an ideal inspired in Elstir was indeed a cult so solemn, so exacting that it never allowed him to be satisfied with what he had achieved; was the most intimate part of himself, and so he had never been able to look at it from a detached standpoint, to extract emotion from it, until the day on which he encountered it realised outside, apart from himself, in the body of a woman, the body of her who in due course became Mme. Elstir and in whom he had been able (as one is able only with something that is not oneself) to find it meritorious, moving, god-like. How comforting, moreover, to let his lips rest upon that Beauty which hitherto he had been obliged with so great labour to extract from ^ within himself, whereas now, mysteriously incarnate, it offered itself to him in a series of communions, filled with saving grace. Elstir at this period was no longer in that early youth in which we look only to the power of our own mind for the realisation of our ideal. He was nearing the age at which we count on bodily satisfactions to stimulate the forces of the brain, at which the exhaustion of the brain inclining us to materialism and the diminution of our activity to the possibility of influences passively received, begin to make us admit that there may indeed be certain bodies, certain callings, certain rhythms that are privileged, realising so naturally our ideal that even without genius, merely by copying the movement of a shoulder, the tension of a throat, we can achieve a masterpiece, it is the age at which we like to caress Beauty with our eyes objectively, outside ourselves, to have it near us, in a tapestry, in a lovely sketch by Titian picked up in a second-hand shop, in a mistress as lovely as Titian’s sketch. When I understood this I could no longer look without pleasure at Mme. Elstir, and her body began to lose its heaviness, for I filled it with an idea, the idea that she was an immaterial creature, a portrait by Elstir. She was one for me, and for him also I dare say. The facts of life have no meaning for the artist, they are to him merely an opportunity for exposing the naked blaze of his genius. One feels unmistakably, when one sees side by side ten portraits of different people painted by Elstir, that they are all, first and foremost, Elstirs. Only, after this rising tide of genius, which sweeps over and submerges a man’s life, when the brain begins to tire, gradually the balance is upset and, like a river that resumes its course after the counter-flow of a spring tide, it is life that once more takes the upper hand. While the first period lasted, the artist has gradually evolved the law, the formula of his unconscious gift. He knows what situations, should he be a novelist — if a painter, what scenes — furnish him with the subject matter, which may be anything in the world but, whatever it is, is essential to his researches as a laboratory might be of a workshop. He knows that he has created his masterpieces out of effects of attenuated light, the action of remorse upon consciousness of guilt, out of women posed beneath trees or half-immersed in water, like statues. A day will come when, owing to the exhaustion of his brain, he will no longer have the strength, when provided with those materials which his genius was won't to use, to make the intellectual effort which alone can produce his work, and will yet continue to seek them out, happy when he finds himself in their presence, because of the spiritual pleasure, the allurement to work that they arouse in him; and, surrounding them besides with a kind of hedge of superstition as if they were superior to all things else, as if in them already dwelt a great part of the work of art which they might be said to carry within them ready made, he will confine himself to the company, to the adoration of his models. He will hold endless conversations with the repentant criminals whose remorse, whose regeneration formed, when he still wrote, the subject of his novels; he will buy a country house in a district where mists attenuate the light, he will spend long hours gazing at the limbs of bathing women; will collect sumptuous stuffs. And thus the beauty of life, a phase that has to some extent lost its meaning, a stage beyond the boundaries of art at which I had already seen Swann come to rest, was that also which, by a slackening of the creative ardour, idolatry of the forms which had inspired it, desire to avoid effort, must ultimately arrest an Elstir’s progress

   At last he had applied the final brush-stroke to his flowers; I sacrificed a minute to look at them; I acquired no merit by the act, for I knew that there was no chance now of our finding the girls on the beach; and yet, had I believed them to be still there, and that these wasted moments would make me miss them, I should have stopped to look none the less, for I should have told myself that Elstir was more interested in his flowers than in my meeting with the girls. My grandmother’s nature, a nature that was the exact counterpart of my complete egoism, was nevertheless reflected in certain aspects of my own. In circumstances in which someone to whom I was indifferent, for whom I had always made a show of affection or respect, ran the risk merely of some unpleasantness whereas I was in real danger, I could not have done otherwise than commiserate with him on his annoyance as though it had been something important, and treat my own danger as nothing, because I would feel that these were the proportions in which he must see things. To be quite accurate, I would go even further, and not only not complain of the danger in which I myself stood but go half-way to meet it, and with that which involved other people try, on the contrary, were I to increase the risk of my being caught myself, to avert it from them. The reasons for this are several, none of which does me the slightest credit. One is that if, while only my reason was employed, I have always believed in self-preservation, whenever in the course of my existence I have found myself obsessed by moral anxieties, or merely by nervous scruples, so puerile often that I dare not enumerate them here, if an unforeseen circumstance then arose, involving for me the risk of being killed, this new preoccupation was so trivial in comparison with the others that I welcomed it with a sense of relief, almost of hilarity. Thus I find myself, albeit the least courageous of men, to have known that feeling which has always seemed to me, in my reasoning moods, so foreign to my nature, so inconceivable, the intoxication of danger. But even although I were, when any, even a deadly peril threatened me, passing through an entirely calm and happy phase, I could not, were I with another person, refrain from sheltering him behind me and choosing for myself the post of danger. When a sufficient store of experience had taught me that I invariably acted, and enjoyed acting, thus, I discovered — and was deeply ashamed by the discovery — that it was because, in contradiction of what I had always believed and asserted, I was extremely sensitive to the opinions of others. Not that this kind of unconfessed self-esteem is in any sense vanity or conceit. For what might satisfy one or other of those failings would give me no pleasure, and I have always refrained from indulging them. But with the people in whose company I have succeeded in concealing most effectively the slight advantages a knowledge of which might have given them a less derogatory idea of myself, I have never been able to deny myself the pleasure of shewing them that I take more trouble to avert the risk of death from their path than from my own. As my motive is then self-esteem and not valour, I find it quite natural that in any crisis they should act differently. I am far from blaming them for it, as I should perhaps if I had been moved by a sense of duty, a duty which would seem to me, in that case, to be as incumbent upon them as upon myself. On the contrary, I feel that it is eminently sensible of them to safeguard their lives, though at the same time I cannot prevent my own safety from receding into the background, which is particularly silly and culpable of me since I have come to realise that the lives of many of the people in front of whom I plant myself when a bomb bursts are more valueless even than my own. However, on the day of this first visit to Elstir, the time was still distant at which I was to become conscious of this difference in value, and there was no question of danger, but simply — a harbinger this of that pernicious self-esteem — the question of my not appearing to attach to the pleasure which I so ardently desired more importance than to the work which the painter had still to finish. It was finished at last. And, once we were out of doors, I discovered that — so long were the days still at this season — it was not so late as I had supposed; we strolled down to the ‘front.’ What stratagems I employed to keep Elstir standing at the spot where I thought that the girls might still come past. Pointing to the cliffs that towered beside us, I kept on asking him to tell me about them, so as to make him forget the time and stay there a little longer. I felt that we had a better chance of waylaying the little band if we moved towards the end of the beach. “I should like to look at those cliffs with you from a little nearer,” I said to him, having noticed that one of the girls was in the habit of going in that direction. “And as we go, do tell me about Carquethuit. I should so like to see Carquethuit,” I went on, without thinking that the so novel character which manifested itself with such force m Elstir’sCarquethuit Harbour, might belong perhaps rather to the painter’s vision than to any special quality in the place itself. “Since I’ve seen your picture, I think that is where I should most like to go, there and to the Pointe du Raz, but of course that would be quite a journey from here.” “Yes, and besides, even if it weren’t nearer, I should advise you perhaps all the same to visit Carquethuit,” he replied. “The Pointe du Raz is magnificent, but after all it is simply the high cliff of Normandy or Brittany which you know already. Carquethuit is quite different, with those rocks bursting from a level shore. I know nothing in France like it, it reminds me rather of what one sees in some parts of Florida. It is most interesting, and for that matter extremely wild too. It is between Clitourps and Nehomme; you know how desolate those parts are; the sweep of the coast-line is delicious. Here, the coast-line is like anywhere else; but along there I can’t tell you what charm it has, what softness.”

   Night was falling; it was time to be turning homewards; I was escorting Elstir in the direction of his villa when suddenly, as it were Mephistopheles springing up before Faust, there appeared at the end of the avenue — like simply an objectification, unreal, diabolical, of the temperament diametrically opposed to my own, of the semi-barbarous and cruel vitality of which I, in my weakness, my excess of tortured sensibility and intellectuality was so destitute — a few spots of the essence impossible to mistake for anything else in the world, a few spores of the zoophytic band of girls, who wore an air of not having seen me but were unquestionably, for all that, proceeding as they advanced to pass judgment on me in their ironic vein. Feeling that a collision between them and us was now inevitable, and that Elstir would be certain to call me, I turned my back, like a bather preparing to meet the shock of a wave; I stopped dead and, leaving my eminent companion to pursue his way, remained where I was, stooping, as if I had suddenly become engrossed in it, towards the window of the curiosity shop which we happened to be passing at the moment. I was not sorry to give the appearance of being able to think of something other than these girls, and I was already dimly aware that when Elstir did call me up to introduce me to them I should wear that sort of challenging expression which betokens not surprise but the wish to appear as though one were surprised — so far is every one of us a bad actor, or everyone else a good thought-reader; — that I should even go so far as to point a finger to my breast, as who should ask “It is me, really, that you want?” and then run to join him, my head lowered in compliance and docility and my face coldly masking my annoyance at being torn from the study of old pottery in order to be introduced to people whom I had no wish to know. Meanwhile I explored the window and waited for the moment in which my name, shouted by Elstir, would come to strike me like an expected and innocuous bullet. The certainty of being introduced to these girls had had the result of making me not only feign complete indifference to them, but actually to feel it. Inevitable from this point, the pleasure of knowing them began at once to shrink, became less to me than the pleasure of talking to Saint-Loup, of dining with my grandmother, of making, in the neighbourhood of Balbec, excursions which I would regret the probability, in consequence of my having to associate with people who could scarcely be much interested in old buildings, of my being forced to abandon. Moreover, what diminished the pleasure which I was about to feel was not merely the imminence but the incoherence of its realisation. Laws as precise as those of hydrostatics maintain the relative position of the images which we form in a fixed order, which the coming event at once upsets. Elstir was just about to call me. This was not at all the fashion in which I had so often, on the beach, in my bedroom, imagined myself making these girls’ acquaintance. What was about to happen was a different event, for which I was not prepared. I recognised neither my desire nor its object; I regretted almost that I had come out with Elstir. But, above all, the shrinking of the pleasure that I expected to feel was due to the certainty that nothing, now, could take that pleasure from me. And it resumed, as though by some latent elasticity in itself, its whole extent when it ceased to be subjected to the pressure of that certainty, at the moment when, having decided to turn my head, I saw Elstir, standing where he had stopped a few feet away with the girls, bidding them good-bye. The face of the girl who stood nearest to him, round and plump and glittering with the light in her eyes, reminded me of a cake on the top of which a place has been kept for a morsel of blue sky. Her eyes, even when fixed on an object, gave one the impression of motion, just as on days of high wind the air, although invisible, lets us perceive the speed with which it courses between us and the unchanging azure. For a moment her gaze intersected mine, like those travelling skies on stormy days which hurry after a rain-cloud that moves less rapidly than they, overtake, touch, cover, pass it and are gone; but they do not know one another, and are soon driven far apart. So our eyes were for a moment confronted, neither pair knowing what the celestial continent that lay before their gaze held of future blessing or disaster. Only at the moment when her gaze was directly coincident with mine, without slackening its movement it grew perceptibly duller. So on a starry night the wind-swept moon passes behind a cloud and veils her brightness for a moment, but soon will shine again. But Elstir had already said goodbye to the girls, and had never summoned me. They disappeared down a cross street; he came towards me. My whole plan was spoiled

   I have said that Albertine had not seemed to me that day to be the same as on previous days and that afterwards, each time I saw her, she was to appear different. But I felt at that moment that certain modifications in the appearance, the importance, the stature of a person may also be due to the variability of certain states of consciousness interposed between that person and us. One of those that play an important part in such transformations is belief; that evening my belief, then the vanishing of my belief, that I was about to know Albertine had, with a few seconds’ interval only, rendered her almost insignificant, then infinitely precious in my sight; some years later, the belief, then the disappearance of the belief, that Albertine was faithful to me brought about similar changes

   Of course, long ago, at Combfay, I had seen shrink or stretch, according to the time of day, according as I was entering one or the other of the two dominant moods that governed my sensibility in turn, my grief at not having my mother with me, as imperceptible all afternoon as is the moon’s light when the sun is shining, and then, when night had come, reigning alone in my anxious heart in the place of recent memories now obliterated. But on that day at Balbec, when I saw that Elstir was leaving the girls and had not called me, I learned for the first time that the variations in the importance which a pleasure or a pain has in our eyes may depend not merely on this alternation of two moods, but on the displacement of invisible beliefs, such, for example, as make death seem to us of no account because they bathe it in a glow of unreality, and thus enable us to attach importance to our attending an evening party, which would lose much of its charm for if, on the announcement that we were sentenced to die by the guillotine, the belief that had bathed the party in its warm glow was instantly shattered; and this part that belief plays, it is true that something in me was aware of it; this was my will; but its knowledge is vain if the mind, the heart continue in ignorance; these last act in good faith when they believe that we are anxious to forsake a mistress to whom our will alone knows that we are still attached. This is because they are clouded by the belief that we shall see her again at any moment. But let this belief be shattered, let them suddenly become aware that this mistress is gone from us for ever, then the mind and heart, having lost their focus, are driven like mad things, the meanest pleasure becomes infinitely great

   Variance of a belief, annulment also of love, which, pre-existent and mobile, comes to rest at the image of any one woman simply because that woman will be almost impossible of attainment. Thenceforward we think not so much of the woman of whom we find difficult in forming an exact picture, as of the means of getting to know her. A whole series of agonies develops and is sufficient to fix our love definitely upon her who is its almost unknown object. Our love becomes immense; we never dream how small a place in it the real woman occupies. And if suddenly, as at the moment when I had seen Elstir stop to talk to the girls, we cease to be uneasy, to suffer pain, since it is this pain that is the whole of our love, it seems to us as though love had abruptly vanished at the moment when at length we grasp the prey to whose value we had not given enough thought before. What did I know of Albertine? One or two glimpses of a profile against the sea, less beautiful, assuredly, than those of Veronese’s women whom I ought, had I been guided by purely aesthetic reasons, to have preferred to her. By what other reasons could I be guided, since, my anxiety having subsided, I could recapture only those mute profiles; I possessed nothing of her besides. Since my first sight of Albertine I had meditated upon her daily, a thousandfold, I had carried on with what I called by her name an interminable unspoken dialogue in which I made her question me, answer me, think and act, and in the infinite series of imaginary Albertines who followed one after the other in my fancy, hour after hour, the real Albertine, a glimpse caught on the beach, figured only at the head, just as the actress who creates a part, the star, appears, out of a long series of performances, in the few first alone. That Albertine was scarcely more than a silhouette, all that was superimposed being of my own growth, so far when we are in love does the contribution that we ourself make outweigh — even if we consider quantity only — those that come to us from the beloved object. And the same is true of love that is given its full effect. There are loves that manage not only to be formed but to subsist around a very little core — even among those whose prayer has been answered after the flesh. An old drawing-master who had taught my grandmother had been presented by some obscure mistress with a daughter. The mother died shortly after the birth of her child, and the drawing-master was so broken-hearted that he did not long survive her. In the last months of his life my grandmother and some of the Combray ladies, who had never liked to make any allusion in the drawing-master’s presence to the woman, with whom, for that matter, he had not officially ‘lived’ and had had comparatively slight relations, took it into their heads to ensure the little girl’s future by combining to purchase an annuity for her. It was my grandmother who suggested this; several of her friends made difficulties; after all was the child really such a very interesting case, was she even the child of her reputed father; with women like that, it was never safe to say. Finally, everything was settled. The child came to thank the ladies. She was plain, and so absurdly like the old drawing-master as to remove every shadow of doubt; her hair being the only nice thing about her, one of the ladies said to her father, who had come with her: “What pretty hair she has.” And thinking that now, the woman who had sinned being dead and the old man only half alive, a discreet allusion to that past of which they had always pretended to know nothing could do no harm, my grandmother added: “It runs in families. Did her mother have pretty hair like that?” “I don’t know,” was the old man’s quaint answer. “I never saw her except with a hat on.”

   But I must not keep Elstir waiting. I caught sight of myself in a glass. To add to the disaster of my not having been introduced to the girls, I noticed that my necktie was all crooked, my hat left long wisps of hair shewing, which did not become me; but it was a piece of luck, all the same, that they should have seen me, even thus attired, in Elstir’s company and so could not forget me; also that I should have put on, that morning, at my grandmother’s suggestion, my smart waistcoat, when I might so easily have been wearing one that was simply hideous, and be carrying my best stick. For while an event for which we are longing never happens quite in the way we have been expecting, failing the advantages on which we supposed that we might count, others present themselves for which we never hoped, and make up for our disappointment; and we have been so dreading the worst that in the end we are inclined to feel that, taking one thing with another, chance has, on the whole, been rather kind to us

    “I did so much want to know them,” I said as I reached Elstir. “Then why did you stand a mile away?” These were his actual words, not that they expressed what was in his mind, since, if his desire had been to grant mine, to call me up to him would have been quite easy, but perhaps because he had heard phrases of this sort, in familiar use among common people when they are in the wrong, and because even great men are in certain respects much the same as common people, take their everyday excuses from the same common stock just as they get their daily bread from the same baker; or it may be that such expressions (which ought, one might almost say, to be read ‘backwards,’ since their literal interpretation is the opposite of the truth) are the instantaneous effect, the negative exposure of a reflex action. “They were in a hurry.” It struck me that of course they must have stopped him from summoning a person who did not greatly attract them; otherwise he would not have failed, after all the questions that I had put to him about them, and the interest which he must have seen that I took in them, to call me. “We were speaking just now of Carquethuit,” he began, as we walked towards his villa. “I have done a little sketch, in which you can see much better how the beach curves. The painting is not bad, but it is different. If you will allow me, just to cement our friendship, I would like to give you the sketch,” he went on, for the people who refuse us the objects of our desire are always ready to offer us something else

    “I should very much like, if you have such a thing, a photograph of the little picture of Miss Sacripant. ‘Sacripant’— that’s not a real name, surely?” “It is the name of a character the sitter played in a stupid little musical comedy.” “But, I assure you, sir, I have never set eyes on her; you look as though you thought that I knew her.” Elstir was silent. “It isn’t Mme. Swann, before she was married?” I hazarded, in one of those sudden fortuitous stumblings upon the truth, which are rare enough in all conscience, and yet give, in the long run, a certain cumulative support to the theory of presentiments, provided that one takes care to forget all the wrong guesses that would invalidate it. Elstir did not reply. The portrait was indeed that of Odette de Crécy. She had preferred not to keep it for many reasons, some of them obvious. But there were others less apparent. The portrait dated from before the point at which Odette, disciplining her features, had made of her face and figure that creation the broad outlines of which her hairdressers, her dressmakers, she herself — in her way of standing, of speaking, of smiling, of moving her hands, her eyes, of thinking — were to respect throughout the years to come. It required the vitiated tastes of a surfeited lover to make Swann prefer to all the countless photographs of the ‘sealed pattern’ Odette which was his charming wife the little photographs which he kept in his room and in which, beneath a straw hat trimmed with pansies, you saw a thin young woman, not even good-looking, with bunched-out hair and drawn features

   But apart from this, had the portrait been not anterior like Swann’s favourite photograph, to the systématisation of Odette’s features in a fresh type, majestic and charming, but subsequent to it, Elstir’s vision would alone have sufficed to disorganise that type. Artistic genius in its reactions is like those extremely high temperatures which have the power to disintegrate combinations of atoms which they proceed to combine afresh in a diametrically opposite order, following another type. All that artificially harmonious whole into which a woman has succeeded in bringing her limbs and features, the persistence of which every day, before going out, she studies in her glass, changing the angle of her hat, smoothing her hair, exercising the sprightliness in her eyes, so as to ensure its continuity, that harmony the keen eye of the great painter instantly destroys, substituting for it a rearrangement of the woman’s features such as will satisfy a certain pictorial ideal of femininity which he carries in his head. Similarly it often happens that, after a certain age, the eye of a great seeker after truth will find everywhere the elements necessary to establish those relations which alone are of interest to him. Like those craftsmen, those players who, instead of making a fuss and asking for what they cannot have, content themselves with the instrument that comes to their hand, the artist might say of anything, no matter what, that it would serve his purpose. Thus a cousin of the Princesse de Luxembourg, a beauty of the most queenly type, having succumbed to a form of art which was new at that time, had asked the leading painter of the naturalist school to do her portrait. At once the artist’s eye had found what he sought everywhere in life. And on his canvas there appeared, in place of the proud lady, a street-boy, and behind him a vast, sloping, purple background which made one think of the Place Pigalle. But even without going so far as that, not only will the portrait of a woman by a great artist not seek in the least to give satisfaction to various demands on the woman’s part — such as for instance, when she begins to age, make her have herself photographed in dresses that are almost those of a young girl, which bring out her still youthful figure and make her appear like the sister, or even the daughter of her own daughter, who, if need be, is tricked out for the occasion as a ‘perfect fright’ by her side — it will, on the contrary, emphasise those very drawbacks which she seeks to hide, and which (as for instance a feverish, that is to say a livid complexion) are all the more tempting to him since they give his picture ‘character’; they are quite enough, however, to destroy all the illusions of the ordinary man who, when he sees the picture, sees crumble into dust the ideal which the woman herself has so proudly sustained for him, which has placed her in her unique, her unalterable form so far apart, so far above the rest of humanity. Fallen now, represented otherwise than in her own type in which she sat unassailably enthroned, she is become nothing more than just an ordinary woman, in the legend of whose superiority we have lost all faith. In this type we are so accustomed to regard as included not only the beauty of an Odette but her personality, her identity, that standing before the portrait which has thus transposed her from it we are inclined to protest not simply “How plain he has made her!” but “Why, it isn’t the least bit like her!” We find it hard to believe that it can be she. We do not recognise her. And yet there is a person there on the canvas whom we are quite conscious of having seen before. But that person is not Odette; the face of the person, her body, her general appearance seem familiar. They recall to us not this particular woman who never held herself like that, whose natural pose had no suggestion of any such strange and teasing arabesque in its outlines, but other women, all the women whom Elstir has ever painted, women whom invariably, however they may differ from one another, he has chosen to plant thus on his canvas facing you, with an arched foot thrust out from under the skirt, a large round hat in one hand, symmetrically corresponding at the level of the knee which it hides to what also appears as a disc, higher up in the picture: the face. And furthermore, not only does a portrait by the hand of genius disintegrate and destroy a woman’s type, as it has been denned by her coquetry and her selfish conception of beauty, but if it is also old, it is not content with ageing the original in the same way as a photograph ages its sitter, by shewing her dressed in the fashions of long ago. In a portrait, it is not only the manner the woman then had of dressing that dates it, there is also the manner the artist had of painting. And this, Elstir’s earliest manner, was the most damaging of birth certificates for Odette because it not only established her, as did her photographs of the same period, as the younger sister of various time-honoured courtesans, but made her portrait contemporary with the countless portraits that Manet or Whistler had painted of all those vanished models, models who already belonged to oblivion or to history

   It was along this train of thought, meditated in silence by the side of Elstir as I accompanied him to his door, that I was being led by the discovery that I had just made of the identity of his model, when this original discovery caused me to make a second, more disturbing still, involving the identity of the artist. He had painted the portrait of Odette de Crécy. Could it possibly be that this man of genius, this sage, this eremite, this philosopher with his marvellous flow of conversation, who towered over everyone and everything, was the foolish, corrupt little painter who had at one time been ‘taken up’ by the Verdurins? I asked him if he had known them, whether by any chance it was he that they used to call M. Biche. He answered me in the affirmative, with no trace of embarrassment, as if my question referred to a period in his life that was ended and already somewhat remote, with no suspicion of what a cherished illusion his words were shattering in me, until looking up he read my disappointment upon my face. His own assumed an expression of annoyance. And, as we were now almost at the gate of his house, a man of less outstanding eminence, in heart and brain, might simply have said ‘good-bye’ to me, a trifle dryly, and taken care to avoid seeing me again. This however was not Elstir’s way with me; like the master that he was — and this was, perhaps, from the point of view of sheer creative genius, his one fault, that he was a master in that sense of the word, for an artist if he is to live the true life of the spirit in its full extent, must be alone and not bestow himself with profusion, even upon disciples — from every circumstance, whether involving himself or other people, he sought to extract, for the better edification of the young, the element of truth that it contained. He chose therefore, rather than say anything that might have avenged the injury to his pride, to say what he thought would prove instructive to me. “There is no man,” he began, “however wise, who has not at some period of his youth said things, or lived in a way the consciousness of which is so unpleasant to him in later life that he would gladly, if he could, expunge it from his memory. And yet he ought not entirely to regret it, because he cannot be certain that he has indeed become a wise man — so far as it is possible for any of us to be wise — unless he has passed through all the fatuous or unwholesome incarnations by which that ultimate stage must be preceded. I know that there are young fellows, the sons and grandsons of famous men, whose masters have instilled into them nobility of mind and moral refinement in their schooldays. They have, perhaps, when they look back upon their past lives, nothing to retract; they can, if they choose, publish a signed account of everything they have ever said or done; but they are poor creatures, feeble descendants of doctrinaires, and their wisdom is negative and sterile. We are not provided with wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can take for us, an effort which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. The lives that you admire, the attitudes that seem noble to you are not the result of training at home, by a father, or by masters at school, they have sprung from beginnings of a very different order, by reaction from the influence of everything evil or commonplace that prevailed round about them. They represent a struggle and a victory. I can see that the picture of what we once were, in early youth, may not be recognisable and cannot, certainly, be pleasing to contemplate in later life. But we must not deny the truth of it, for it is evidence that we have really lived, that it is in accordance with the laws of life and of the mind that we have, from the common elements of life, of the life of studios, of artistic groups — assuming that one is a painter — extracted something that goes beyond them.” Meanwhile we had reached his door. I was disappointed at not having met the girls. But after all there was now the possibility of meeting them again later on; they had ceased to do no more than pass beyond a horizon on which I had been ready to suppose that I should never see them reappear. Around them no longer swirled that sort of great eddy which had separated me from them, which had been merely the expression of the perpetually active desire, mobile, compelling, fed ever on fresh anxieties, which was aroused in me by their inaccessibility, their flight from me, possibly for ever. My desire for them, I could now set it at rest, hold it in reserve, among all those other desires the realisation of which, as soon as I knew it to be possible, I would cheerfully postpone. I took leave of Elstir; I was alone once again. Then all of a sudden, despite my recent disappointment, I saw in my mind’s eye all that chain of coincidence which I had not supposed could possibly come about, that Elstir should be a friend of those very girls, that they who only that morning had been to me merely figures in a picture with the sea for background had seen me, had seen me walking in friendly intimacy with a great painter, who was now informed of my secret longing and would no doubt do what he could to assuage it. All this had been a source of pleasure to me, but that pleasure had remained hidden; it was one of those visitors who wait before letting us know that they are in the room until all the rest have gone and we are by ourselves. Then only do we catch sight of them, and can say to them, “I am at your service,” and listen to what they have to tell us. Sometimes between the moment at which these pleasures have entered our consciousness and the moment at which we are free to entertain them, so many hours have passed, we have in the interval seen so many people that we are afraid lest they should have grown tired of waiting. But they are patient, they do not grow tired, and as soon as the crowd has gone we find them there ready for us. Sometimes it is then we who are so exhausted that it seems as though our weary mind will not have the strength left to seize and retain those memories, those impressions for which our frail self is the one habitable place, the sole means of realisation. And we should regret that failure, for existence to us is hardly interesting save on the days on which the dust of realities is shot with magic sand, on which some trivial incident of life becomes a spring of romance. Then a whole promontory of the inaccessible world rises clear in the light of our dream, and enters into our life, our life in which, like the sleeper awakened, we actually see the people of whom we have been so ardently dreaming that we came to believe that we should never behold them save in our dreams

   The sense of comfort that I drew from the probability of my now being able to meet the little band whenever I chose was all the more precious to me because I should not have been able to keep watch for them during the next few days, which would be taken up with preparations for Saint-Loup’s departure. My grandmother was anxious to offer my friend some proof of her gratitude for all the kindnesses that he had shewn to her and myself. I told her that he was a great admirer of Proudhon, and this put it into her head to send for a collection of autograph letters by that philosopher which she had once bought; Saint-Loup came to her room to look at them on the day of their arrival, which was also his last day at Balbec. He read them eagerly, fingering each page with reverence, trying to get the sentences by heart; and then, rising from the table, was beginning to apologise to my grandmother for having stayed so long, when he heard her say: “No, no; take them with you; they are for you to keep; that was why I sent for them, to give them to you.”

   He was overpowered by a joy which he could no more control than we can a physical condition that arises without the intervention of our will. He blushed scarlet as a child who has just been whipped, and my grandmother was a great deal more touched to see all the efforts that he was making (without success) to control the joy that convulsed him than she would have been to hear any words of thanks that he could have uttered. But he, fearing that he had failed to shew his gratitude properly, begged me to make his excuses to her again, next day, leaning from the window of the little train of the local railway company which was to take him back to his regiment. The distance was, as a matter of fact, nothing. He had thought of going, as he had frequently done that summer, when he was to return the same evening and was not encumbered with luggage, by road. But this time he would have had, anyhow, to put all his heavy luggage in the train. And he found it simpler to take the train himself also, following the advice of the manager who, on being consulted, replied that “Carriage or train, it was more or less equivocal.” He meant us to understand that they were equivalent (in fact, very much what Françoise would have expressed as “coming to as near as made no difference”). “Very well,” Saint-Loup had decided, “I will take the ‘little crawler.’” I should have taken it too, had I not been tired, and gone with my friend to Doncières; failing this I kept on promising, all the time that we waited in the Balbec station — the time, that is to say, which the driver of the little train spent in waiting for unpunctual friends, without whom he refused to start, and also in seeking some refreshment for himself — to go over there and see him several times a week. As Bloch had come to the station also — much to Saint-Loup’s disgust — the latter, seeing that our companion could hear him begging me to come to luncheon, to dinner, to stay altogether at Doncières, finally turned to him and, in the most forbidding tone, intended to counteract the forced civility of the invitation and to prevent Bloch from taking it seriously: “If you ever happen to be passing through Doncières any afternoon when I am off duty, you might ask for me at the barracks; but I hardly ever am off duty.” Perhaps, also, Robert feared lest, if left to myself, I might not come, and, thinking that I was more intimate with Bloch than I made out, was providing me in this way with a travelling companion, one who would urge me on

   I was afraid that this tone, this way of inviting a person while warning him not to come, might have wounded Bloch, and felt that Saint-Loup would have done better, saying nothing. But I was mistaken, for after the train had gone, while we were walking back together as far as the crossroads at which we should have to part, one road going to the hotel, the other to the Blochs’ villa, he never ceased from asking me on what day we should go to Doncières, for after “all the civilities that Saint-Loup had shewn” him, it would be ‘too unmannerly’ on his part not to accept the invitation. I was glad that he had not noticed, or was so little displeased as to wish to let it be thought that he had not noticed on how far from pressing, how barely polite a note the invitation had been sounded. At the same time I should have liked Bloch, for his own sake, to refrain from making a fool of himself by going over at once to Doncières. But I dared not offer a piece of advice which could only have offended him by hinting that Saint-Loup had been less pressing than himself impressed. He was a great deal too ready to respond, and even if all his faults of this nature were atoned for by remarkable qualities which others, with more reserve than he, would not possess, he carried indiscretion to a pitch that was almost maddening. The week must not, to hear him speak, pass without our going to Doncières (he said ‘our’ for I think that he counted to some extent on my presence there as an excuse for his own). All the way home, opposite the gymnasium, in its grove of trees, opposite the lawn-tennis courts, the mayor’s office, the shell-fish stall, he stopped me, imploring me to fix a day, and, as I did not, left me in a towering rage, saying: “As your lordship pleases. For my part, I’m obliged to go since he has invited me.”

   Saint-Loup was still so much afraid of not having thanked my grandmother properly that he charged me once again to express his gratitude to her a day or two later in a letter I received from him from the town in which he was quartered, a town which seemed, on the envelope where the post-mark had stamped its name, to be hastening to me across country, to tell me that within its walls, in the Louis XVI cavalry barracks, he was thinking of me. The paper was embossed with the arms of Marsantes, in which I could make out a lion, surmounted by a coronet formed by the cap of a Peer of France

    “After a journey which,” he wrote, “passed pleasantly enough, with a book I bought at the station, by Arvède Barine (a Russian author, I fancy; it seemed to me remarkably well written for a foreigner, but you shall give me your critical opinion, you are bound to know all about it, you fount of knowledge who have read everything), here I am again in the thick of this debased existence, where, alas, I feel a sad exile, not having here what I had to leave at Balbec; this life in which I cannot discover one affectionate memory, any intellectual attraction; an environment on which you would probably look with contempt — and yet it has a certain charm. Everything seems to have changed since I was last here, for in the interval one of the most important periods in my life, that from which our friendship dates, has begun. I hope that it may never come to an end. I have spoken of our friendship, of you, to one person only, to the friend I told you of, who has just paid me a surprise visit here. She would like immensely to know you, and I feel that you would get on well together, for she too is extremely literary. I, on the other hand, to go over in my mind all our talk, to live over again those hours which I never shall forget, have shut myself off from my comrades, excellent fellows, but altogether incapable of understanding that sort of thing. This remembrance of moments spent with you I should almost have preferred, on my first day here, to call up for my own solitary enjoyment, without writing. But I was afraid lest you, with your subtle mind and ultra-sensitive heart, might, if you did not hear from me, needlessly torment yourself, if, that is to say, you still condescend to occupy your thoughts with this blunt trooper whom you will have a hard task to polish and refine, and make a little more subtle and worthier of your company.”

   On the whole this letter, in its affectionate spirit, was not at all unlike those which, when I did not yet know Saint-Loup, I had imagined that he would write to me, in those daydreams from which the coldness of his first greeting had shaken me by bringing me face to face with an icy reality which was not, however, to endure. Once I had received this letter, whenever, at luncheon-time, the post was brought in, I could tell at once when it was from him that a letter came, for it had always that second face which a person assumes when he is absent, in the features of which (the characters of his script) there is no reason why we should not suppose that we are tracing an individual soul just as much as in the line of a nose or the inflexions of a voice

   I would now gladly remain at the table while it was being cleared, and, if it was not a moment at which the girls of the little band might be passing, it was no longer solely towards the sea that I would turn my eyes. Since I had seen such things depicted in water-colours by Elstir, I sought to find again in reality, I cherished, as though for their poetic beauty, the broken gestures of the knives still lying across one another, the swollen convexity of a discarded napkin upon which the sun would patch a scrap of yellow velvet, the half-empty glass which thus shewed to greater advantage the noble sweep of its curved sides, and, in the heart of its translucent crystal, clear as frozen daylight, a dreg of wine, dusky but sparkling with reflected lights, the displacement of solid objects, the transmutation of liquids by the effect of light and shade, the shifting colour of the plums which passed from green to blue and from blue to golden yellow in the half-plundered dish, the chairs, like a group of old ladies, that came twice daily to take their places round the white cloth spread on the table as on an altar at which were celebrated the rites of the palate, where in the hollows of oyster-shells a few drops of lustral water had gathered as in tiny holy water stoups of stone; I tried to find beauty there where I had never imagined before that it could exist, in the most ordinary things, in the profundities of ‘still life.’

   When, some days after Saint-Loup’s departure, I had succeeded in persuading Elstir to give a small tea-party, at which I was to meet Albertine, that freshness of appearance, that smartness of attire, both (alas) fleeting, which were to be observed in me at the moment of my starting out from the Grand Hotel, and were due respectively to a longer rest than usual and to special pains over my toilet, I regretted my inability to reserve them (and also the credit accruing from Elstir’s friendship) for the captivation of some other, more interesting person; I regretted having to use them all up on the simple pleasure of making Albertine’s acquaintance. My brain assessed this pleasure at a very low value now that it was assured me. But, inside, my will did not for a moment share this illusion, that will which is the persevering and unalterable servant of our successive personalities; hiding itself in secret places, despised, downtrodden, untiringly faithful, toiling without intermission and with no thought for the variability of the self, its master, if only that master may never lack what he requires. Whereas at the moment when we are just about to start on a long-planned and eagerly awaited holiday, our brain, our nerves begin to ask themselves whether it is really worth all the trouble involved, the will, knowing that those lazy masters would at once begin to consider their journey the most wonderful experience, if it became impossible for them to take it, the will leaves them explaining their difficulties outside the station, multiplying their hesitations; but busies itself with taking the tickets and putting us into the carriage before the train starts. It is as invariable as brain and nerves are fickle, but as it is silent, gives no account of its actions, it seems almost non-existent; it is by its dogged determination that the other constituent parts of our personality are led, but without seeing it, while they distinguish clearly all their own uncertainties. My nerves and brain then started a discussion as to the real value of the pleasure that there would be in knowing Albertine, while I studied in the glass vain and perishable attractions which nerves and brain would have preserved intact for use on some other occasion. But my will would not let the hour pass at which I must start, and ‘it was Elstir’s address that it called out to the driver. Brain and nerves were at liberty, now that the die was cast, to think this ‘a pity.’ If my will had given the man a different address, they would have been finely ‘sold.’

   When I arrived at Elstir’s, a few minutes later, my first impression was that Mlle. Simonet was not in the studio. There was certainly a girl sitting there in a silk frock, bareheaded, but one whose marvellous hair, whose nose, meant nothing to me, in whom I did not recognise the human entity that I had formed out of a young cyclist strolling past, in a polo-cap, between myself and the sea. It was Albertine, nevertheless. But even when I knew it to be she, I gave her no thought. On entering any social gathering, when we are young, we lose consciousness of our old self, we become a different man, every drawing-room being a fresh universe, in which, coming under the sway of a new moral perspective, we fasten our attention, as if they were to matter to us for all time, on people, dances, card-tables, all of which we shall have forgotten by the morning. Obliged to follow, if I was to arrive at the goal of conversation with Albertine, a road in no way of my own planning, which first brought me to a halt at Elstir, passed by other groups of guests to whom I was presented, then along the table, at which I was offered, and ate, a strawberry tart or two, while I listened, motionless, to the music that was beginning in another part of the room, I found myself giving to these various incidents the same importance as to my introduction to Mlle. Simonet, an introduction which was now nothing more than one among several such incidents, having entirely forgotten that it had been, but a few minutes since, my sole object in coming there that day. But is it not ever thus in the bustle of daily life, with every true happiness, every great sorrow? In a room full of other people we receive from her whom we love the answer, propitious or fatal, which we have been awaiting for the last year. But we must go on talking, ideas come, one after another, forming a smooth surface which is pricked, at the very most, now and then by a dull throb from within of the memory, deep-rooted enough but of very slender growth, that misfortune has come upon us. If, instead of misfortune, it is happiness, it may be that not until many years have elapsed will we recall that the most important event in our sentimental life occurred without our having time to give it any prolonged attention, or even to become aware of it almost, at a social gathering, it may have been, to which we had gone solely in expectation of that event

   When Elstir asked me to come with him so that he might introduce me to Albertine, who was sitting a little farther down the room, I first of all finished eating a coffee éclair and, with a show of keen interest, asked an old gentleman whose acquaintance I had just made (and thought that I might, perhaps, offer him the rose in my buttonhole which he had admired) to tell me more about the old Norman fairs. This is not to say that the introduction which followed did not give me any pleasure, nor assume a definite importance in my eyes. But so far as the pleasure was concerned, I was not conscious of it, naturally, until some time later, when, once more in the hotel, and in my room alone, I had become myself again. Pleasure in this respect is like photography. What we take, in the presence of the beloved object, is merely a negative film; we develop it later, when we are at home, and have once again found at our disposal that inner darkroom, the entrance to which is barred to us so long as we are with other people

   If my consciousness of the pleasure it had brought me was thus retarded by a few hours, the importance of this introduction I felt immediately. At such moments of introduction, for all that we feel ourselves to have been suddenly enriched, to have been furnished with a pass that will admit us henceforward to pleasures which we have been pursuing for weeks past, but in vain, we realise only too clearly that this acquisition puts an end for us not merely to hours of toilsome search — a relief that could only fill us with joy — but also to the very existence of a certain person, her whom our imagination had wildly distorted, our anxious fear that we might never become known to her enlarged. At the moment when our name sounds on the lips of the person introducing us, especially if he amplifies it, as Elstir was now doing, with a flattering account of us — in that sacramental moment, as when in a fairy tale the magician commands a person suddenly to become someone else, she to whose presence we have been longing to attain vanishes; how could she remain the same when, for one thing — owing to the attention which the stranger is obliged to pay to the announcement of our name and the sight of our person — in the eyes that only yesterday were situated at an infinite distance (where we supposed that our eyes, wandering, uncontrolled, desperate, divergent, would never succeed in meeting them) the conscious gaze, the incommunicable thought which we have been seeking have been miraculously and quite simply replaced by our own image, painted in them as though behind the glass of a smiling mirror. If this incarnation of ourself in the person who seems to differ most from us is what does most to modify the appearance of the person to whom we have just been introduced, the form of that person still remains quite vague; and we are free to ask ourself whether she will turn out to be a god, a table or a basin. But, as nimble as the wax-modellers who will fashion a bust before our eyes in five minutes, the few words which the stranger is now going to say to us will substantiate her form, will give her something positive and final that will exclude all the hypotheses by which, a moment ago, our desire, our imagination were being tempted. Doubtless, even before her coming to this party, Albertine had ceased to be to me simply that sole phantom worthy to haunt our life which is what remains of a passing stranger, of whom we know nothing and have caught but the barest glimpse. Her relation to Mme. Bontemps had already restricted the scope of those marvellous hypotheses, by stopping one of the channels along which they might have spread. As I drew closer to the girl, and began to know her better, my knowledge of her underwent a process of subtraction, all the factors of imagination and desire giving place to a notion which was worth infinitely less, a notion to which, it must be admitted, there was added presently what was more or less the equivalent, in the domain of real life, of what joint stock companies give one, after paying interest on one’s capital, and call a bonus. Her name, her family connexions had been the original limit set to my suppositions. Her friendly greeting while, standing close beside her, I saw once again the tiny mole on her cheek, below her eye, marked another stage; last of all, I was surprised to hear her use the adverb ‘perfectly’ (in place of ‘quite’) of two people whom she mentioned, saying of one: “She is perfectly mad, but very nice for all that,” and of the other, “He is a perfectly common man, a perfect bore.” However little to be commended this use of ‘perfectly’ may be, it indicates a degree of civilisation and culture which I could never have imagined as having been attained by the bacchante with the bicycle, the frenzied muse of the golf-course. Nor did it mean that after this first transformation Albertine was not to change again for me, many times. The good and bad qualities which a person presents to us, exposed to view on the surface of his or her face, rearrange themselves in a totally different order if we approach them from another angle — just as, in a town, buildings that appear strung irregularly along a single line, from another aspect retire into a graduated distance, and their relative heights are altered. To begin with, Albertine now struck me as not implacable so much as almost frightened; she seemed to me rather respectably than ill bred, judging by the description, ‘bad style,’ ‘a comic manner’ which she applied to each in turn of the girls of whom I spoke to her; finally, she presented as a target for my line of sight a temple that was distinctly flushed and hardly attractive to the eye, and no longer the curious gaze which I had always connected with her until then. But this was merely a second impression and there were doubtless others through which I was successively to pass. Thus it can be only after one has recognised, not without having had to feel one’s way, the optical illusions of one’s first impression that one can arrive at an exact knowledge of another person, supposing such knowledge to be ever possible. But it is not; for while our original impression of him undergoes correction, the person himself, not being an inanimate object, changes in himself, we think that we have caught him, he moves, and, when we imagine that at last we are seeing him clearly, it is only the old impressions which we had already formed of him that we have succeeded in making clearer, when they no longer represent him

   And yet, whatever the inevitable disappointments that it must bring in its train, this movement towards what we have only half seen, what we have been free to dwell upon and imagine at our leisure, this movement is the only one that is wholesome for the senses, that whets the appetite. How dreary a monotony must pervade those people’s lives who, from indolence or timidity, drive in their carriages straight to the doors of friends whom they have got to know without having first dreamed of knowing them, without ever daring, on the way, to stop and examine what arouses their desire

   I returned home, my mind full of the party, the coffee éclair which I had finished eating before I let Elstir take me up to Albertine, the rose which I had given the old gentleman, all the details selected without our knowledge by the circumstances of the occasion, which compose in a special and quite fortuitous order the picture that we retain of a first meeting. But this picture, I had the impression that I was seeing it from a fresh point of view, a long way remote from myself, realising that it had not existed only for me, when some months later, to my great surprise, on my speaking to Albertine on the day on which I had first met her, she reminded me of the éclair, the flower that I had given away, all those things which I had supposed to have been — I will not say of importance only to myself but — perceived only by myself, and which I now found thus transcribed, in a version the existence of which I had never suspected, in the mind of Albertine. On this first day itself, when, on my return to the hotel, I was able to visualise the memory which I had brought away with me, I realised the consummate adroitness with which the sleight of hand had been performed, and how I had talked for a moment or two with a person who, thanks to the skill of the conjurer, without actually embodying anything of that other person whom I had for so long been following as she paced beside the sea, had been effectively substituted for her. I might, for that matter, have guessed as much in advance, since the girl of the beach was a fabrication invented by myself. In spite of which, as I had, in my conversations with Elstir, identified her with this other girl, I felt myself in honour bound to fulfil to the real the promises of love made to the imagined Albertine. We betroth ourselves by proxy, and think ourselves obliged, in the sequel, to marry the person who has intervened. Moreover, if there had disappeared, provisionally at any rate, from my life, an anguish that found adequate consolation in the memory of polite manners, of that expression ‘perfectly common’ and of the glowing temple, that memory awakened in me desire of another kind which, for all that it was placid and not at all painful, resembling rather brotherly love, might in the long run become fully as dangerous by making me feel at every moment a compelling need to kiss this new person, whose charming ways, shyness, unlooked-for accessibility, arrested the futile process of my imagination but gave birth to a sentimental gratitude. And then, since memory begins at once to record photographs independent of one another, eliminates every link, any kind of sequence from between the scenes portrayed in the collection which it exposes to our view, the most recent does not necessarily destroy or cancel those that came before. Confronted with the commonplace though appealing Albertine to whom I had spoken that afternoon, I still saw the other, mysterious Albertine outlined against the sea. These were now memories, that is to say pictures neither of which now seemed to me any more true than the other. But, to make an end of this first afternoon of my introduction to Albertine, when trying to recapture that little mole on her cheek, just under the eye, I remembered that, looking from Elstir’s window, when Albertine had gone by, I had seen the mole on her chin. In fact, whenever I saw her I noticed that she had a mole, but my inaccurate memory made it wander about the face of Albertine, fixing it now in one place, now in another

   Whatever my disappointment in finding in Mlle. Simonet a girl so little different from those that I knew already, just as my rude awakening when I saw Balbec Church did not prevent me from wishing still to go to Quimperlé, Pont-Aven and Venice, I comforted myself with the thought that through Albertine at any rate, even if she herself was not all that I had hoped, I might make the acquaintance of her comrades of the little band

   I thought at first that I should fail. As she was to be staying (and I too) for a long time still at Balbec, I had decided that the best thing was not to make my efforts to meet her too apparent, but to wait for an accidental encounter. But should this occur every day, even, it was greatly to be feared that she would confine herself to acknowledging my bow from a distance, and such meetings, repeated day after day throughout the whole season, would benefit me not at all

   Shortly after this, one morning when it had been raining and was almost cold, I was accosted on the ‘front’ by a girl wearing a close-fitting toque and carrying a muff, so different from the girl whom I had met at Elstir’s party that to recognise in her the same person seemed an operation beyond the power of the human mind; mine was, nevertheless, successful in performing it, but after a momentary surprise which did not, I think, escape Albertine’s notice. On the other hand, when I instinctively recalled the good breeding which had so impressed me before, she filled me with a converse astonishment by her rude tone and manners typical of the ‘little band.’ Apart from these, her temple had ceased to be the optical centre, on which the eye might comfortably rest, of her face, either because I was now on her other side, or because her toque hid it, or else possibly because its inflammation was not a constant thing. “What weather!” she began. “Really the perpetual summer of Balbec is all stuff and nonsense. You don’t go in for anything special here, do you? We don’t ever see you playing golf, or dancing at the Casino. You don’t ride, either. You must be bored stiff. You don’t find it too deadly, staying about on the beach all day? I see, you just bask in the sun like a lizard; you enjoy that. You must have plenty of time on your hands. I can see you’re not like me; I simply adore all sports. You weren’t at the Sogne races! We went in the ‘tram,’ and I can quite believe you don’t see the fun of going in an old ‘tin-pot’ like that. It took us two whole hours! I could have gone there and back three times on my bike.” I, who had been lost in admiration of Saint-Loup when he, in the most natural manner in the world, called the little local train the ‘crawler,’ because of the ceaseless windings of its line, was positively alarmed by the glibness with which Albertine spoke of the ‘tram,’ and called it a ‘tin-pot.’ I could feel her mastery of a form of speech in which I was afraid of her detecting and scorning my inferiority. And yet the full wealth of the synonyms that the little band possessed to denote this railway had not yet been revealed to me. In speaking, Albertine kept her head motionless, her nostrils closed, allowing only the corners of her lips to move. The result of this was a drawling, nasal sound, into the composition of which there entered perhaps a provincial descent, a juvenile affectation of British phlegm, the teaching of a foreign governess and a congestive hypertrophy of the mucus of the nose. This enunciation which, as it happened, soon disappeared when she knew people better, giving place to a natural girlish tone, might have been thought unpleasant. But it was peculiar to herself, and delighted me. Whenever I had gone for several days without seeing her, I would refresh my spirit by repeating to myself: “We don’t ever see you playing golf,” with the nasal intonation in which she had uttered the words, point blank, without moving a muscle of her face. And I thought then that there could be no one in the world so desirable

   We formed that morning one of those couples who dotted the ‘front’ here and there with their conjunction, their stopping together for time enough just to exchange a few words before breaking apart, each to resume separately his or her divergent stroll. I seized the opportunity, while she stood still, to look again and discover once and for all where exactly the little mole was placed. Then, just as a phrase of Vinteuil which had delighted me in the sonata, and which my recollection allowed to wander from the andante to the finale, until the day when, having the score in my hands, I was able to find it, and to fix it in my memory in its proper place, in the scherzo, so this mole, which I had visualised now on her cheek, now on her chin, came to rest for ever on her upper lip, just below her nose. In the same way, too, do we come with amazement upon lines that we know by heart in a poem in which we never dreamed that they were to be found

   At that moment, as if in order that against the sea there might multiply in freedom, in the variety of its forms, all the rich decorative whole which was the lovely unfolding of the train of maidens, at once golden and rosy, baked by sun and wind, Albertine’s friends, with their shapely limbs, their supple figures, but so different one from another, came into sight in a cluster that expanded as it approached, advancing towards us, but keeping closer to the sea, along a parallel line. I asked Albertine’s permission to walk for a little way with her. Unfortunately, all she did was to wave her hand to them in greeting. “But your friends will be disappointed if you don’t go with them,” I hinted, hoping that we might all walk together. A young man with regular features, carrying a bag of golf-clubs, sauntered up to us. It was the baccarat-player, whose fast ways so enraged the chief magistrate’s wife. In a frigid, impassive tone, which he evidently regarded as an indication of the highest refinement, he bade Albertine good day. “Been playing golf, Octave?” she asked. “How did the game go? Were you in form?” “Oh, it’s too sickening; I can’t play for nuts,” he replied. “Was Andrée playing?” “Yes, she went round in seventy-seven.” “Why, that’s a record!” “I went round in eighty-two yesterday.” He was the son of an immensely rich manufacturer who was to take an important part in the organisation of the coming World’s Fair. I was struck by the extreme degree to which, in this young man and in the other by no means numerous male friends of the band of girls, the knowledge of everything that pertained to clothes and how to wear them, cigars, English drinks, horses, a knowledge which he possessed in its minutest details with a haughty infallibility that approached the reticent modesty of the true expert, had been developed in complete isolation, unaccompanied by the least trace of any intellectual culture. He had no hesitation as to the right time and place for dinner-jacket or pyjamas, but neither had he any suspicion of the circumstances in which one might or might not employ this or that word, or even of the simplest rules of grammar. This disparity between the two forms of culture must have existed also in his father, the President of the Syndicate that ‘ran’ Balbec, for, in an open letter to the electors which he had recently had posted on all the walls, he announced: “I desired to see the Mayor, to speak to him of the matter; he would not listen to my righteous plaint.” Octave, at the Casino, took prizes in all the dancing competitions, for bostons, tangos and what-not, an accomplishment that would entitle him, if he chose, to make a fine marriage in that seaside society where it is not figuratively but in sober earnest that the young women ‘marry their dancing-partners.’ He lighted a cigar with a “D’you mind?” to Albertine, as one who asks permission to finish, while going on talking, an urgent piece of work. For he was one of those people who can never be ‘doing nothing,’ although there was nothing, for that matter, that he could ever be said to do. And as complete inactivity has the same effect on us, in the end, as prolonged overwork, and on the character as much as on the life of body and muscles, the unimpaired nullity of intellect that was enshrined behind Octave’s meditative brow had ended by giving him, despite his air of unruffled calm, ineffectual longings to think which kept him awake at night, for all the world like an overwrought philosopher

   Supposing that if I knew their male friends I should have more opportunities of seeing the girls, I had been on the point of asking for an introduction to Octave. I told Albertine this, as soon as he had left us, still muttering, “I couldn’t play for nuts!” I thought I would thus put into her head the idea of doing it next time. “But I can’t,” she cried, “introduce you to a tame cat like that. This place simply swarms with them. But what on earth would they have to say to you? That one plays golf quite well, and that’s all there is to it. I know what I’m talking about; you’d find he wasn’t at all your sort.” “Your friends will be cross with you if you desert them like this,” I repeated, hoping that she would then suggest my joining the party. “Oh, no, they don’t want me.” We ran into Bloch, who directed at me a subtle, insinuating smile, and, embarrassed by the presence of Albertine, whom he did not know, or, rather, knew ‘without knowing’ her, bent his head with a stiff, almost irritated jerk. “What’s he called, that Ostrogoth?” Albertine asked. “I can’t think why he should bow to me; he doesn’t know me. And I didn’t bow to him, either.” I had no time to explain to her, for, bearing straight down upon us, “Excuse me,” he began, “for interrupting you, but I must tell you that I am going to Don-cières to-morrow. I cannot put it off any longer without discourtesy; indeed, I ask myself, what must de Saint-Loup-en-Bray think of me. I just came to let you know that I shall take the two o’clock train. At your service.” But I thought now only of seeing Albertine again, and of trying to get to know her friends, and Doncières, since they were not going there, and my going would bring me back too late to see them still on the beach, seemed to me to be situated at the other end of the world. I told Bloch that it was impossible. “Oh, very well, I shall go alone. In the fatuous words of Master Arouet, I shall say to Saint-Loup, to beguile his clericalism:

            ‘My duty stands alone, by his in no way bound;
               Though he should choose to fail, yet faithful I’ll be found.’”

    “I admit he’s not a bad looking boy,” was Albertine’s comment, “but he makes me feel quite sick.” I had never thought that Bloch might be ‘not a bad looking boy’; and yet, when one came to think of it, so he was. With his rather prominent brow, very aquiline nose, and his air of extreme cleverness and of being convinced of his cleverness, he had a pleasing face. But he could not succeed in pleasing Albertine. This was perhaps due, to some extent, to her own disadvantages, the harshness, the want of feeling of the little band, its rudeness towards everything that was not itself. And later on, when I introduced them, Albertine’s antipathy for him grew no less. Bloch belonged to a section of society in which, between the free and easy customs of the ‘smart set’ and the regard for good manners which a man is supposed to shew who ‘does not soil his hands,’ a sort of special compromise has been reached which differs from the manners of the world and is nevertheless a peculiarly unpleasant form of worldliness. When he was introduced to anyone he would bow with a sceptical smile, and at the same time with an exaggerated show of respect, and, if it was to a man, would say: “Pleased to meet you, sir,” in a voice which ridiculed the words that it was uttering, though with a consciousness of belonging to some one who was no fool. Having sacrificed this first moment to a custom which he at once followed and derided (just as on the first of January he would greet you with a ‘Many happy!’) he would adopt an air of infinite cunning, and would ‘proffer subtle words’ which were often true enough but ‘got on’ Albertine’s nerves. When I told her on this first day that his name was Bloch, she exclaimed: “I would have betted anything he was a Jew-boy. Trust them to put their foot in it!” Moreover, Bloch was destined to give Albertine other grounds for annoyance later on. Like many intellectuals, he was incapable of saying a simple thing in a simple way. He would find some precious qualification for every statement, and would sweep from particular to general. It vexed Albertine, who was never too well pleased at other people’s shewing an interest in what she was doing, that when she had sprained her ankle and was keeping quiet, Bloch said of her: “She is outstretched on her chair, but in her ubiquity has not ceased to frequent simultaneously vague golf-courses and dubious tennis-courts.” He was simply being ‘literary,’ of course, but this, in view of the difficulties which Albertine felt that it might create for her with friends whose invitations she had declined on the plea that she was unable to move, was quite enough to disgust her with the face, the sound of the voice, of the young man who could say such things about her. We parted, Albertine and I, after promising to take a walk together later. I had talked to her without being any more conscious of where my words were falling, of what became of them, than if I were dropping pebbles into a bottomless pit. That our words are, as a general rule, filled, by the person to whom we address them, with a meaning which that person derives from her own substance, a meaning widely different from that which we had put into the same words when we uttered them, is a fact which the daily round of life is perpetually demonstrating. But if we find ourselves as well in the company of a person whose education (as Albertine’s was to me) is inconceivable, her tastes, her reading, her principles unknown, we cannot tell whether our words have aroused in her anything that resembles their meaning, any more than in an animal, although there are things that even an animal may be made to understand. So that to attempt any closer friendship with Albertine seemed to me like placing myself in contact with the unknown, if not the impossible, an occupation as arduous as breaking a horse, as reposeful as keeping bees or growing roses

    I had thought, a few hours before, that Albertine would acknowledge my bow but would not speak to me. We had now parted, after planning to make some excursion soon together. I vowed that when I next met Albertine I would treat her with greater boldness, and I had sketched out in advance a draft of all that I would say to her, and even (being now quite convinced that she was not strait-laced) of all the favours that I would demand of her. But the mind is subject to external influences, as plants are, and cells and chemical elements, and the medium in which its immersion alters it is a change of circumstances, or new surroundings. Grown different by the mere fact of her presence, when I found myself once again in Albertine’s company, what I said to her was not at all what I had meant to say. Remembering her flushed temple, I asked myself whether she might not appreciate more keenly a polite attention which she knew to be disinterested. Besides, I was embarrassed by certain things in her look, in her smile. They might equally well signify a laxity of morals and the rather silly merriment of a girl who though full of spirits was at heart thoroughly respectable. A single expression, on a face as in speech, is susceptible of divers interpretations, and I stood hesitating like a schoolboy faced by the difficulties of a piece of Greek prose

    On this occasion we met almost immediately the tall one, Andrée, the one who had jumped over the old banker, and Albertine was obliged to introduce me. Her friend had a pair of eyes of extraordinary brightness, like, in a dark house, a glimpse through an open door of a room into which the sun is shining with a greenish reflexion from the glittering sea

    A party of five were passing, men whom I had come to know very well by sight during my stay at Balbec. I had often wondered who they could be. “They’re nothing very wonderful,” said Albertine with a sneering laugh. “The little old one with dyed hair and yellow gloves has a fine touch; he knows how to draw all right, he’s the Balbec dentist; he’s a good sort. The fat one is the Mayor, not the tiny little fat one, you must have seen him before, he’s the dancing master; he’s rather a beast, you know; he can’t stand us, because we make such a row at the Casino; we smash his chairs, and want to have the carpet up when we dance; that’s why he never gives us prizes, though we’re the only girls there who can dance a bit. The dentist is a dear, I would have said how d’ye do to him, just to make the dancing master swear, but I couldn’t because they’ve got M. de Sainte-Croix with them; he’s on the General Council; he comes of a very good family, but he’s joined the Republicans, to make more money. No nice people ever speak to him now. He knows my uncle, because they’re both in the Government, but the rest of my family always cut him. The thin one in the waterproof is the bandmaster. You know him, of course. You don’t? Oh, he plays divinely. You haven’t been to Cavalleria Rusticana? I thought it too lovely! He’s giving a concert this evening, but we can’t go because it’s to be in the town hall. In the Casino it wouldn’t matter, but in the town hall, where they’ve taken down the crucifix. Andrée’s mother would have a fit if we went there. You’re going to say that my aunt’s husband is in the Government. But what difference does that make? My aunt is my aunt. That’s not why I’m fond of her. The only thing she has ever wanted has been to get rid of me. No, the person who has really been a mother to me, and all the more credit to her because she’s no relation at all, is a friend of mine whom I love just as much as if she was my mother. I will let you see her ‘photo.’” We were joined for a moment by the golf champion and baccarat plunger, Octave. I thought that I had discovered a bond between us, for I learned in the course of conversation that he was some sort of relative, and even more a friend of the Verdurins. But he spoke contemptuously of the famous Wednesdays, adding that M. Verdurin had never even heard of a dinner-jacket, which made it a horrid bore when one ran into him in a music-hall, where one would very much rather not be greeted with “Well, you young rascal,” by an old fellow in a frock coat and black tie, for all the world like a village lawyer. Octave left us, and soon it was Andrée’s turn, when we came to her villa, into which she vanished without having uttered a single word to me during the whole of our walk. I regretted her departure, all the more in that, while I was complaining to Albertine how chilling her friend had been with me, and was comparing in my mind this difficulty which Albertine seemed to find in making me know her friends with the hostility that Elstir, when he might have granted my desire, seemed to have encountered on that first afternoon, two girls came by to whom I lifted my hat, the young Ambresacs, whom Albertine greeted also

    I felt that, in Albertine’s eyes, my position would be improved by this meeting. They were the daughters of a kinswoman of Mme. de Ville-parisis, who was also a friend of Mme. de Luxembourg. M. and Mme. d’Ambresac, who had a small villa at Balbec and were immensely rich, led the simplest of lives there, and always went about dressed he in an unvarying frock coat, she in a dark gown. Both of them used to make sweeping bows to my grandmother, which never led to anything further. The daughters, who were very pretty, were dressed more fashionably, but in a fashion suited rather to Paris than to the seaside. With their long skirts and large hats, they had the look of belonging to a different race from Albertine. She, I discovered, knew all about them

    “Oh, so you know the little d’Ambresacs, do you? Dear me, you have some swagger friends. After all, they’re very simple souls,” she went on as though this might account for it. “They’re very nice, but so well brought up that they aren’t allowed near the Casino, for fear of us — we’ve such a bad tone. They attract you, do they? Well, it all depends on what you like. They’re just little white rabbits, really. There may be something in that, of course. If little white rabbits are what appeals to you, they may supply a long-felt want. It seems, there must be some attraction, because one of them has got engaged already to the Marquis de Saint-Loup. Which is a cruel blow to the younger one, who is madly in love with that young man. I’m sure, the way they speak to you with their lips shut is quite enough for me. And then they dress in the most absurd way. Fancy going to play golf in silk frocks! At their age, they dress more showily than grown-up women who really know about clothes. Look at Mme. Elstir; there’s a well dressed woman if you like.” I answered that she had struck me as being dressed with the utmost simplicity. Albertine laughed. “She does put on the simplest things, I admit, but she dresses wonderfully, and to get what you call simplicity costs her a fortune.” Mme. Elstir’s gowns passed unnoticed by any one who had not a sober and unerring taste in matters of attire. This was lacking in me. Elstir possessed it in a supreme degree, or so Albertine told me. I had not suspected this, nor that the beautiful but quite simple objects which littered his studio were treasures long desired by him which he had followed from sale room to sale room, knowing all their history, until he had made enough money to be able to acquire them. But as to this Albertine, being as ignorant as myself, could not enlighten me. Whereas when it came to clothes, prompted by a coquettish instinct, and perhaps by the regretful longing of a penniless girl who is able to appreciate with greater disinterestedness, more delicacy of feeling, in other, richer people the things that she will never be able to afford for herself, she expressed herself admirably on the refinement of Elstir’s taste, so hard to satisfy that all women appeared to him badly dressed, while, attaching infinite importance to right proportions and shades of colour, he would order to be made for his wife, at fabulous prices, the sunshades, hats and cloaks which he had learned from Albertine to regard as charming, and which a person wanting in taste would no more have noticed than myself. Apart from this, Albertine, who had done a little painting, though without, she confessed, having any ‘gift’ for it, felt a boundless admiration for Elstir, and, thanks to his precept and example, shewed a judgment of pictures which was in marked contrast to her enthusiasm for Cavalleria Rusticana. The truth was, though as yet it was hardly apparent, that she was highly intelligent, and that in the things that she said the stupidity was not her own but that of her environment and age. Elstir’s had been a good but only a partial influence. All the branches of her intelligence had not reached the same stage of development. The taste for pictures had almost caught up the taste for clothes and all forms of smartness, but had not been followed by the taste for music, which was still a long way behind

    Albertine might know all about the Ambresacs; but as he who can achieve great things is not necessarily capable of small, I did not find her, after I had bowed to those young ladies, any better disposed to make me known to her friends. “It’s too good of you to attach any importance to them. You shouldn’t take any notice of them; they don’t count. What on earth can a lot of kids like them mean to a man like you? Now Andrée, I must say, is remarkably clever. She is a good girl, that, though she is perfectly fantastic at times, but the others are really dreadfully stupid.” When I had left Albertine, I felt suddenly a keen regret that Saint-Loup should have concealed his engagement from me and that he should be doing anything so improper as to choose a wife before breaking with his mistress. And then, shortly afterwards, I met Andrée, and as she went on talking to me for some time I seized the opportunity to tell her that I would very much like to see her again next day, but she replied that this was impossible, because her mother was not at all well, and she would have to stay beside her. The next day but one, when I was at Elstir’s, he told me how greatly Andrée had been attracted by me; on my protesting: “But it was I who was attracted by her from the start; I asked her to meet me again yesterday, but she could not.” “Yes, I know; she told me all about that,” was his reply, “she was very sorry, but she had promised to go to a picnic, somewhere miles from here. They were to drive over in a break, and it was too late for her to get out of it.” Albeit this falsehood (Andrée knowing me so slightly) was of no real importance, I ought not to have continued to seek the company of a person who was capable of uttering it. For what people have once done they will do again indefinitely, and if you go every year to see a friend who, the first time, was not able to meet you at the appointed place, or was in bed with a chill, you will find him in bed with another chill which he has just caught, you will miss him again at another meeting-place at which he has failed to appear, for a single and unalterable reason in place of which he supposes himself to have various reasons, drawn from the circumstances. One morning, not long after An-dree’s telling me that she would be obliged to stay beside her mother, I was taking a short stroll with Albertine, whom I had found on the beach tossing up and catching again on a cord an oddly shaped implement which gave her a look of Giotto’s ‘Idolatry’; it was called, for that matter, ‘Diabolo,’ and is so fallen into disuse now that, when they come upon the picture of a girl playing with one, the critics of future generations will solemnly discuss, as it might be over one of the allegorical figures in the Arena, what it is that she is holding. A moment later their friend with the penurious and harsh appearance, the same one who on that first day had sneered so malevolently: “I do feel sorry for him, poor old man,” when, she saw the old gentleman’s head brushed by the flying feet of Andrée, came up to Albertine with “Good morning,‘m I disturbing you?” She had taken off her hat, for comfort, and her hair, like a strange and fascinating-plant, lay over her brow, displaying all the delicate tracery of its foliation^ Albertine, perhaps because she resented seeing the other bare-headed, made-no reply, preserved a frigid silence in spite of which the girl stayed with us, kept apart from myself by Albertine, who arranged at one moment to be-alone with her, at another to walk with me leaving her to follow. I was obliged, to secure an introduction, to ask for it in the girl’s hearing. Then, as Albertine was uttering my name, on the face and in the blue eyes of this girl, whose expression I had thought so cruel when I heard her say: “Poor old man, I do feel so sorry for him,” I saw gather and gleam a cordial, friendly smile, and she held out her hand. Her hair was golden, and not her hair only; for if her cheeks were pink and her eyes blue it was like the still roseate morning sky which sparkles everywhere with dazzling points of gold

    At once kindled by her flame, I said to myself that this was a child who when in love grew shy, that it was for my sake, from love for me that she had remained with us, despite Albertine’s rebuffs, and that she must have rejoiced in the opportunity to confess to me at last, by that smiling, friendly gaze, that she would be as kind to me as she was terrible to other people. Doubtless she had noticed me on the beach, when I still knew nothing of her, and had been thinking of me ever since; perhaps it had been to win my admiration that she mocked at the old gentleman, and because she had not succeeded in getting to know me that on the following days she appeared so morose. From the hotel I had often seen her, in the evenings, walking by herself on the beach. Probably in the hope of meeting me. And now, hindered as much by Albertine’s presence as she would have been by that of the whole band, she had evidently attached herself to us, braving the increasing coldness of her friend’s attitude, only in the hope of outstaying her, of being left alone with me, when she might make an appointment with me for some time when she would find an excuse to slip away without either her family’s or her friends’ knowing that she had gone, and would meet me in some safe place before church or after golf. It was all the more difficult to see her because Andrée had quarrelled with her and now detested her. “I have put up far too long with her terrible dishonesty,” she explained to me, “her baseness; I can’t tell you all the vile insults she has heaped on me. I have stood it all because of the others. But her latest effort was really too much!” And she told me of some foolish thing that this girl had done, which might indeed have injurious consequences to Andrée herself

    But those private words promised me by Gisèle’s confiding eyes for the moment when Albertine should have left us by ourselves, were destined never to be spoken, because after Albertine, stubbornly planted between us, had answered with increasing curtness, and finally had ceased to respond at all to her friend’s remarks, Gisèle at length abandoned the attempt and turned back. I found fault with Albertine for having been so disagreeable. “It will teach her to be more careful how she behaves. She’s not a bad kid, but she’d talk the head off a donkey. She’s no business, either, to go poking her nose into everything. Why should she fasten herself on to us without being asked? In another minute, I’d have told her to go to blazes. Besides I can’t stand her going about with her hair like that; it’s such bad form.” I gazed at Albertine’s cheeks as she spoke, and asked myself what might be the perfume, the taste of them: this time they were not cool, but glowed with a uniform pink, violet-tinted, creamy, like certain roses whose petals have a waxy gloss. I felt a passionate longing for them such as one feels sometimes for a particular flower. “I hadn’t noticed it,” was all that I said. “You stared at her hard enough; anyone would have said you wanted to paint her portrait,” she scolded, not at all softened by the fact that it was at herself that I was now staring so fixedly. “I don’t believe you would care for her, all the same. She’s not in the least a flirt. You like little girls who flirt with you, I know. Anyhow, she won’t have another chance of fastening on to us and being sent about her business; she’s going off to-day to Paris.” “Are the rest of your friends going too?” “No; only she and ‘Miss,’ because she’s got an exam, coming; she’s got to stay at home and swot for it, poor kid. It’s not much fun for her, I don’t mind telling you. Of course, you may be set a good subject, you never know. But it’s a tremendous risk. One girl I know was asked: Describe an accident that you have witnessed. That was a piece of luck. But I know another girl who got: State which you would rather have as a friend, Alceste or Philinte. I’m sure I should have dried up altogether! Apart from everything else, it’s not a question to set to girls. Girls go about with other girls; they’re not supposed to have gentlemen friends.” (This announcement, which shewed that I had but little chance of being admitted to the companionship of the band, froze my blood.) “But in any case, supposing it was set to boys, what on earth would you expect them to say to a question like that? Several parents wrote to the Gaulois, to complain of the difficult questions that were being set. The joke of it is that in a collection of prize-winning essays they gave two which treated the question in absolutely opposite ways. You see, it all depends on which examiner you get. One would like you to say that Philinte was a flatterer and a scoundrel, the other that you couldn’t help admiring Alceste, but that he was too cantankerous, and that as a friend you ought to choose Philinte. How can you expect a lot of unfortunate candidates to know what to say when the professors themselves can’t make up their minds. But that’s nothing. They get more difficult every year. Gisèle will want all her wits about her if she’s to get through.” I returned to the hotel. My grandmother was not there. I waited for her for some time; when at last she appeared, I begged her to allow me, in quite unexpected circumstances, to make an expedition which might keep me away for a couple of days. I had luncheon with her, ordered a carriage and drove to the station. Gisèle would shew no surprise at seeing me there. After we had changed at Doncières, in the. Paris train, there would be a carriage with a corridor, along which, while the governess dozed, I should be able to lead Gisèle into dark corners, and make an appointment to meet her on my return to Paris, which I would then try to put forward to the earliest possible date. I would travel with her as far as Caen or Evreux, whichever she preferred, and would take the next train back to Balbec. And yet, what would she have thought of me had she known that I had hesitated for a long time between her and her friends, that quite as much as with her I had contemplated falling in love with Albertine, with the bright-eyed girl, with Rosemonde. I felt a pang of remorse now that a bond of mutual affection was going to unite me with Gisèle. I could, moreover, truthfully have assured her that Albertine no longer interested me. I had seen her that morning as she swerved aside, almost turning her back on me, to speak to Gisèle. On her head, which was bent sullenly over her bosom, the hair that grew at the back, different from and darker even than the rest, shone as though she had just been bathing. “Like a dying duck in a thunderstorm!” I thought to myself, this view of her hair having let into Albertine’s body a soul entirely different from that implied hitherto by her glowing complexion and mysterious gaze. That shining cataract of hair at the back of her head had been for a moment or two all that I was able to see of her, and continued to be all that I saw in retrospect. Our memory is like a shop in the window of which is exposed now one, now another photograph of the same person. And as a rule the most recent exhibit remains for some time the only one to be seen. While the coachman whipped on his horse I sat there listening to the words of gratitude and affection which Gisèle was murmuring in my ear, born, all of them, of her friendly smile and outstretched hand, the fact being that in those periods of my life in which I was not actually, but desired to be in love, I carried in my mind not only an ideal form of beauty once seen, which I recognised at a glance in every passing stranger who kept far enough from me for her confused features to resist any attempt at identification, but also the moral phantom — ever ready to be incarnate — of the woman who was ‘going to fall in love with me, to take up her cues in the amorous comedy which I had had written out in my mind from my earliest boyhood, and in which every nice girl seemed to me to be equally desirous of playing, provided that she had also some of the physical qualifications required. In this play, whoever the new star might be whom I invited to create or to revive the leading part, the plot, the incidents, the lines themselves preserved an unalterable form

    Within the next few days, in spite of the reluctance that Albertine had shewn from introducing me to them, I knew all the little band of that first afternoon (except Gisèle, whom, owing to a prolonged delay at the level crossing by the station and a change in the time-table, I had not succeeded in meeting on the train, which had been gone some minutes before I arrived, and to whom as it happened I never gave another thought), and two or three other girls as well to whom at my request they introduced me. And thus, my expectation of the pleasure which I should find in a new girl springing from another girl through whom I had come to know her, the latest was like one of those new varieties of rose which gardeners get by using first a rose of another kind. And as I passed from blossom to blossom along this flowery chain, the pleasure of knowing one that was different would send me back to her to whom I was indebted for it, with a gratitude in which desire was mingled fully as much as in my new expectation. Presently I was spending all my time among these girls

    Alas! in the freshest flower it is possible to discern those just perceptible signs which to the instructed mind indicate already what will be, by the desiccation or fructification of the flesh that is to-day in bloom, the ultimate form, immutable and already predestinate, of the autumnal seed. The eye rapturously follows a nose like a wavelet that deliriously curls the water’s face at daybreak and seems not to move, to be capturable by the pencil, because the sea is so calm then that one does not notice its tidal flow. Human faces seem not to change while we are looking at them, because the revolution which they perform is too slow for us to perceive it. But we have only to see, by the side of any of those girls, her mother or her aunt, to realise the distance over which, obeying the gravitation of a type that is, generally speaking, deplorable, her features will have travelled in less than thirty years, and must continue to travel until the sunset hour, until her face, having vanished altogether below the horizon, catches the light no more. I knew that, as deep, as ineluctable as is their Jewish patriotism or Christian atavism in those who imagine themselves to be the most emancipated of their race, there dwelt beneath the rosy inflorescence of Albertine, Rosemonde, Andrée, unknown to themselves, held in reserve until the circumstances should arise, a coarse nose, a protruding jaw, a bust that would create a sensation when it appeared, but was actually in the wings, ready to “come on,” just as it might be a burst of Dreyfusism, or clericalism, sudden, unforeseen, fatal, some patriotic, some feudal form of heroism emerging suddenly when the circumstances demand it from a nature anterior to that of the man himself, by means of which he thinks, lives, evolves, gains strength himself or dies, without ever being able to distinguish that nature from the successive phases which in turn he takes for it. Even mentally, we depend a great deal more than we think upon natural laws, and our mind possesses already, like some cryptogamous plant, every little peculiarity that we imagine ourselves to be selecting. For we can see only the derived ideas, without detecting the primary cause (Jewish blood, French birth or whatever it may be) that inevitably produced them, and which at a given moment we expose. And perhaps, while the former appear to us to be the result of deliberate thought, the latter that of an imprudent disregard for our own health, we take from our family, as the papilionaceae take the form of their seed, as well the ideas by which we live as the malady from which we shall die

    As on a plant whose flowers open at different seasons, I had seen, expressed in the form of old ladies, on this Balbec shore, those shrivelled seed-pods, those flabby tubers which my friends would one day be. But what matter? For the moment it was their flowering-time. And so when Mme. de Villeparisis asked me to drive with her I sought an excuse to be prevented. I never went to see Elstir unless accompanied by my new friends. I could not even spare an afternoon to go to Doncières, to pay the visit I had promised Saint-Loup. Social engagements, serious discussions, even a friendly conversation, had they usurped the place allotted to my walks with these girls, would have had the same effect on me as if, when the luncheon bell rang, I had been taken not to a table spread with food but to turn the pages of an album. The men, the youths, the women, old or mature, whose society we suppose that we shall enjoy, are borne by us only on an unsubstantial plane surface, because we are conscious of them only by visual perception restricted to its own limits; whereas it is as delegates from our other senses that our eyes dart towards young girls; the senses follow, one after another, in search of the various charms, fragrant, tactile, savoury, which they thus enjoy even without the aid of fingers and lips; and able, thanks to the art of transposition, the genius for synthesis in which desire excels, to reconstruct beneath the hue of cheeks or bosom the feel, the taste, the contact that is forbidden them, they give to these girls the same honeyed consistency as they create when they stand rifling the sweets of a rose-garden, or before a vine whose clusters their eyes alone devour

    If it rained, although the weather had no power to daunt Albertine, who was often to be seen in her waterproof spinning on her bicycle through the driving showers, we would Spend the day in the Casino, where on such days it would have seemed to me impossible not to go. I had the greatest contempt for the young Ambresacs, who had never set foot in it. And I willingly joined my friends in playing tricks on the dancing master. As a rule we had to listen to admonition from the manager, or from some of his staff, usurping dictatorial powers, because my friends, even Andrée herself, whom on that account I had regarded when I first saw her as so dionysiac a creature, whereas in reality she was delicate, intellectual, and this year far from well, in spite of which her actions were controlled less by the state of her health than by the spirit of that age which overcomes every other consideration and confounds in a general gaiety the weak with the strong, could not enter the outer hall of the rooms without starting to run, jumping over all the chairs, sliding back along the floor, their balance maintained by a graceful poise of their outstretched arms, singing the while, mingling all the arts, in that first bloom of youth, in the manner of those poets of ancient days for whom the different ‘kinds’ were not yet separate, so that in an epic poem they would introduce rules of agriculture with theological doctrine

    This Andrée who had struck me when I first saw them as the coldest of them all, was infinitely more refined, more loving, more sensitive than Albertine, to whom she displayed the caressing, gentle affection of an elder sister. At the Casino she would come across the floor to sit down by me, and knew instinctively, unlike Albertine, to refuse my invitation to dance, or even, if I was tired, to give up the Casino and come to me instead at the hotel. She expressed her friendship for me, for Albertine, in terms which were evidence of the most exquisite understanding of the things of the heart, which may have been partly due to the state of her health. She had always a merry smile of excuse for the childish behaviour of Albertine, who expressed with a crude violence the irresistible temptation held out to her by the parties and picnics to which she had not the sense, like Andrée, resolutely to prefer staying and talking with me. When the time came for her to go off to a luncheon party at the golf-club, if we were all three together she would get ready to leave us, then, coming up to Andrée: “Well, Andrée, what are you waiting for now? You know we are lunching at the golf-club.” “No; I’m going to stay and talk to him,” replied Andrée, pointing to me. “But you know, Mme. Durieux invited you,” cried Albertine, as if Andree’s intention to remain with me could be explained only by ignorance on her part where else and by whom she had been bidden. “Look here, my good girl, don’t be such an idiot,” Andrée chid her. Albertine did not insist, fearing a suggestion that she too should stay with me. She tossed her head. “Just as you like,” was her answer, uttered in the tone one uses to an invalid whose self-indulgence is killing him by inches, “I must fly; I’m sure your watch is slow,” and off she went. “She is a dear girl, but quite impossible,” said Andrée, bathing her friend in a smile at once caressing and critical. If in this craze for amusement Albertine might be said to echo something of the old original Gilberte, that is because a certain similarity exists, although the type evolves, between all the women we love, a similarity that is due to the fixity of our own temperament, which it is that chooses them, eliminating all those who would not be at once our opposite and our complement, fitted that is to say to gratify our senses and to wring our heart. They are, these women, a product of our temperament, an image inversely projected, a negative of our sensibility. So that a novelist might, in relating the life of his hero, describe his successive love-affairs in almost exactly similar terms, and thereby give the impression not that he was repeating himself but that he was creating, since an artificial novelty is never so effective as a repetition that manages to suggest a fresh truth. He ought, moreover, to indicate in the character of the lover a variability which becomes apparent as the story moves into fresh regions, into different latitudes of life. And perhaps he would be stating yet another truth if while investing all the other persons of his story with distinct characters he refrained from giving any to the beloved. We understand the characters of people who do not interest us; how can we ever grasp that of a person who is an intimate part of our existence, whom after a little we no longer distinguish in any way from ourselves, whose motives provide us with an inexhaustible supply of anxious hypotheses which we perpetually reconstruct. Springing from somewhere beyond our understanding, our curiosity as to the woman whom we love overleaps the bounds of that woman’s character, which we might if we chose but probably will not choose to stop and examine. The object of our uneasy investigation is something more essential than those details of character comparable to the tiny particles of epidermis whose varied combinations form the florid originality of human flesh. Our intuitive radiography pierces them, and the images which it photographs for us, so far from being those of any single face, present rather the joyless universality of a skeleton

    Andrée, being herself extremely rich while the other was penniless and an orphan, with real generosity lavished on Albertine the full benefit of her wealth. As for her feelings towards Gisèle, they were not quite what I had been led to suppose. News soon reached us of the young student, and when Albertine handed round the letter she had received, a letter intended by Gisèle to give an account of her journey and to report her safe arrival to the little band, pleading laziness as an excuse for not having written yet to the rest, I was surprised to hear Andrée (for I imagined an irreparable breach between them) say: “I shall write to her to-morrow, because if I wait for her to write I may have to wait for years, she’s such a slacker.” And, turning to myself, she added: “You saw nothing much in her, evidently; but she’s a jolly nice girl, and besides I’m really very fond of her.” From which I concluded that Andrée’s quarrels were apt not to last very long

    Except on these rainy days, as we had always arranged to go on our bicycles along the cliffs, or on an excursion inland, an hour or so before it was time to start I would go upstairs to make myself smart and would complain if Françoise had not laid out all the things that I wanted. Now even in Paris she would proudly, angrily straighten a back which the years had begun to bend, at the first word of reproach, she so humble, she so modest and charming when her self-esteem was flattered. As this was the mainspring of her life: her satisfaction, her good humour were in direct ratio to the difficulty of the tasks imposed on her. Those which she had to perform at Balbec were so easy that she shewed almost all the time a discontent which was suddenly multiplied an hundredfold, with the addition of an ironic air of offended dignity when I complained, on my way down to join my friends, that my hat had not been brushed or my ties sorted. She who was capable of taking such endless pains, without in consequence assuming that she had done anything at all, on my simply remarking that a coat was not in its proper place, not only did she boast of the care with which she had “put it past sooner than let it go gathering the dust,” but, paying a formal tribute to her own labours, lamented that it was little enough of a holiday that she was getting at Balbec, and that we would not find another person in the whole world who would consent to put up with such treatment. “I can’t think how anyone can leave things lying about the way you do; you just try and get anyone else to find what you want in such a mix-up. The devil himself would give it up as a bad job.” Or else she would adopt a regal mien, scorching me with her fiery glance, and preserve a silence that was broken as soon as she had fastened the door behind her and was outside in the passage, which would then reverberate with utterances which I guessed to be insulting, though they remained as indistinct as those of characters in a play whose opening lines are spoken in the wings, before they appear on the stage. And even if nothing was missing and Françoise was in a good temper, still she made herself quite intolerable when I was getting ready to go out with my friends. For, drawing upon a store of stale witticisms at their expense which, in my need to be talking about the girls, I had made in her hearing, she put on an air of being about to reveal to me things of which I should have known more than she had there been any truth in her statements, which there never was, Françoise having misunderstood what she had heard. She had, like most people, her own ways; a person is never like a straight highway, but surprises us with the strange, unavoidable windings of his course through life, by which, though some people may not notice them, we find it a perpetual annoyance to be stopped and hindered. Whenever I arrived at the stage of “Where is my hat?” or uttered the name of Andrée or Albertine, I was forced by Françoise to stray into endless and absurd side-tracks which greatly delayed my progress. So too when I asked her to cut me the sandwiches of cheese or salad, or sent her out for the cakes which I was to eat while we rested on the cliffs, sharing them with the girls, and which the girls “might very well have taken turns to provide, if they had not been so close,” declared Françoise, to whose aid there came at such moments a whole heritage of atavistic peasant rapacity and coarseness, and for whom one would have said that the soul of her late enemy Eulalie had been broken into fragments and reincarnate, more attractively than it had ever been in Saint-Eloi’s, in the charming bodies of my friends of the little band. I listened to these accusations with a dull fury at finding myself brought to a standstill at one of those places beyond which the well-trodden country path that was Françoise’s character became impassable, though fortunately never for very long. Then, my hat or coat found and the sandwiches ready, I sailed out to find Albertine, Andrée, Rosemonde, and any others there might be, and on foot or on our bicycles we would start

    In the old days I should have preferred our excursion to be made in bad weather. For then I still looked to find in Balbec the ‘Cimmerians’ land,’ and fine days were a thing that had no right to exist there, an intrusion of the vulgar summer of seaside holiday-makers into that ancient region swathed in eternal mist. But now, everything that I had hitherto despised, shut out of my field of vision, not only effects of sunlight upon sea and shore, but even the regattas, the race-meetings, I would have sought out with ardour, for the reason for which formerly I had wanted only stormy seas, which was that these were now associated in my mind, as the others had been, with an aesthetic idea. Because I had gone several times with my new friends to visit Elstir, and, on the days when the girls were there, what he had selected to shew us were drawings of pretty women in yachting dress, or else a sketch made on a race-course near Balbec. I had at first shyly admitted to Elstir that I had not felt inclined to go to the meetings that were being held there. “You were wrong,” he told me, “it is such a pretty sight, and so well worth seeing. For one thing, that peculiar animal, the jockey, on whom so many eager eyes are fastened, who in the paddock there looks so grim, a colourless face between his brilliant jacket and cap, one body and soul with the prancing horse he rides, how interesting to analyse his professional movements, the bright splash of colour he makes, with the horse’s coat blending in it, as they stream down the course. What a transformation of every visible object in that luminous vastness of a racecourse where one is constantly surprised by fresh lights and shades which one sees only there. How charming the women can look there, too! The first day’s racing was quite delightful, and there were women there exquisitely dressed, in the misty light of a Dutch landscape, in which one could feel rising to cloud the sun itself the penetrating coldness of the water. Never have I seen women arriving in carriages, or standing with glasses to their eyes in so extraordinary a light, which was due, I suppose, to the moisture from the sea. I should simply have loved to paint it. I came home from the races quite mad, and so keen to get to work! “After which he became more enthusiastic still over the yacht-races, and I realised that regattas, social fixtures where well-dressed women might be seen bathed in the greenish light of a marine race-course, might be for a modern artist as interesting a subject as were the revels which they so loved to depict for a Veronese or Carpaccio. When I suggested this to Elstir, “Your comparison is all the more true,” he replied, “since, from the position of the city in which they painted, those revels were to a great extent aquatic. Except that the beauty of the shipping in those days lay as a rule in its solidity, in the complication of its structure. They had water-tournaments, as we have here, held generally in honour of some Embassy, such as Carpaccio shews us in his Legend of Saint Ursula. The vessels were massive, built up like architecture, and seemed almost amphibious, like lesser Venices set in the heart of the greater, when, moored to the banks by hanging stages decked with crimson satin and Persian carpets, they bore their freight of ladies in cherry-red brocade and green damask close under the balconies incrusted with many-coloured marbles from which other ladies leaned to gaze at them, in gowns with black sleeves slashed with white, stitched with pearls or bordered with lace. You cannot tell where the land ends and the water begins, what is still the palace or already the vessel, the caravel, the galeas, the Bucintoro.” Albertine had listened with the keenest interest to these details of costume, these visions of elegance that Elstir was describing to us. “Oh, I should so like to see that lace you speak of; it’s so pretty, the Venice-point,” she cried. “Besides, I should love to see Venice.” “You may, perhaps, before very long, be able,” Elstir informed her, “to gaze upon the marvellous stuffs which they used to wear. Hitherto one has seen them only in the works of the Venetian painters, or very rarely among the treasures of old churches, except now and then when a specimen has come into the sale-room. But I hear that a Venetian artist, called Fortuny, has recovered the secret of the craft, and that before many years have passed women will be able to walk abroad, and better still to sit at home in brocades as sumptuous as those that Venice adorned, for her patrician daughters, with patterns brought from the Orient. But I don’t know that I should much care for that, that it wouldn’t be too much of an anachronism for the women of to-day, even when they parade at regattas, for, to return to our modern pleasure-craft, the times have completely changed since ‘Venice, Queen of the Adriatic.’ The great charm of a yacht, of the furnishings of a yacht, of yachting dress, is their simplicity, as just things for the sea, and I do so love the sea. I must confess to you that I prefer the fashions of to-day to those of Veronese’s and even of Carpaccio’s time. What there is so attractive about our yachts — and the smaller yachts especially, I don’t like the huge ones, they’re too much like ships; yachts are like women’s hats, you must keep within certain limits — is the unbroken surface, simple, gleaming, grey, which under a cloudy, leaden sky takes on a creamy softness. The cabin in which we live ought to make us think of a little café. And women’s clothes on board a yacht are the same sort of thing; what really are charming are those light garments, uniformly white, of cloth or linen or nankeen or drill, which in the sunlight and against the blue of the sea shew up with as dazzling a whiteness as a spread sail. You very seldom see a woman, for that matter, who knows how to dress, and yet some of them are quite wonderful. At the races, Mlle. Léa had a little white hat and a little white sunshade, simply enchanting. I don’t know what I wouldn’t give for that little sunshade.” I should have liked very much to know in what respect this little sunshade differed from any other, and for other reasons, reasons of feminine vanity, Albertine was still more curious. But, just as Françoise used to explain the excellence of her soufflés by “It’s the way you do them,” so here the difference lay in the cut. “It was,” Elstir explained, “quite tiny, quite round, like a Chinese umbrella.” I mentioned the sunshades carried by various ladies, but it was not like any of them. Elstir found them all quite hideous. A man of exquisite taste, singularly hard to please, he would isolate some minute detail which was the whole difference between what was worn by three-quarters of the women he saw, and horrified him, and a thing which enchanted him by its prettiness; and — in contrast to its effect on myself, whose mind any display of luxury at once sterilised — stimulated his desire to paint “so as to make something as attractive.” “Here you see a young lady who has guessed what the hat and sunshade were like,” he said to me, pointing to Albertine whose eyes shone with envy. “How I should love to be rich, to have a yacht!” she said to the painter. “I should come to you to tell me how to run it. What lovely trips I’d take. And what fun it would be to go to Cowes for the races. And a motor-car! Tell me, do you think the ladies’ fashions for motoring pretty?” “No”; replied Elstir, “but that will come in time. You see, there are very few firms at present, one or two only, Callot — although they go in rather too freely for lace — Doucet, Cheruit, Paquin sometimes. The others are all horrible.” “Then, is there a vast difference between a Callot dress and one from any ordinary shop?” I asked Albertine. “Why, an enormous difference, my little man! I beg your pardon! Only, alas! what you get for three hundred francs in an ordinary shop will cost two thousand there. But there can be no comparison; they look the same only to people who know nothing at all about it.” “Quite so,” put in Elstir; “though I should not go so far as to say that it is as profound as the difference between a statue from Rheims Cathedral and one from Saint-Augustin. By the way, talking of cathedrals,” he went on, addressing himself exclusively to me, because what he was saying had reference to an earlier conversation in which the girls had not taken part, and which for that matter would not have interested them at all, “I spoke to you the other day of Balbec Church as a great cliff, a huge breakwater built of the stone of the country; now look at this”; he handed me a water-colour. “Look at these cliffs (it’s a sketch I did close to here, at the Creuniers); don’t these rocks remind you of a cathedral?” And indeed one would have taken them for soaring red arches. But, painted on a roasting hot day, they seemed to have crumbled into dust, made volatile by the heat which had drunk up half the sea, distilled over the whole surface of the picture almost into a gaseous state. On this day on which the sunlight had, so to speak, destroyed reality, reality concentrated itself in certain dusky and transparent creatures which, by contrast, gave a more striking, a closer impression of life: the shadows. Ravening after coolness, most of them, deserting the scorched open spaces, had fled for shelter to the foot of the rocks, out of reach of the sun; others, swimming gently upon the tide, like dolphins, kept close under the sides of the moving vessels, whose hulls they extended upon the pale surface of the water with their glossy blue forms. It was perhaps the thirst for coolness which they conveyed that did most to give me the sensation of the heat of this day and made me exclaim how much I regretted not knowing the Creuniers. Albertine and Andrée were positive that I must have been there hundreds of times. If so I had been there without knowing it, never suspecting that one day the sight of these rocks was to inspire me with such a thirst for beauty, not perhaps exactly natural beauty such as I had been seeking hitherto among the cliffs of Balbec, but rather architectural. Above all, I who, having come here to visit the kingdom of the storm, had never found, on any of my drives with Mme. de Villeparisis, when often we saw it only from afar, painted in a gap between the trees, the ocean sufficiently real, sufficiently liquid, giving a sufficient impression that it was hurling its massed forces against the shore, and would have liked to see it lie motionless only under a wintry shroud of fog, I could never have believed that I should now be dreaming of a sea which was nothing more than a whitish vapour that had lost both consistency and colour. But of such a sea Elstir, like the people who sat musing on board those vessels drowsy with the heat, had so intensely felt the enchantment that he had succeeded in transcribing, in fixing for all time upon the painted sheet the imperceptible reflux of the tide, the throb of one happy moment; and one suddenly became so enamoured, at the sight of this magic portrait, that one could think of nothing else than to range the world over, seeking to recapture the vanished day in its instantaneous, slumbering beauty

    So that if before these visits to Elstir, before I had set eyes on one of his sea-pictures in which a young woman in a dress of white serge or linen, on the deck of a yacht flying the American flag, had duplicated a white linen dress and coloured flag in my imagination which at once bred in me an insatiable desire to visit the spot and see there with my own eyes white linen dresses and flags against the sea, as though no such experience had ever yet befallen me, always until then I had taken care when I stood by the sea to expel from my field of vision, as well as the bathers in the foreground, the yachts with their too dazzling sails that were like seaside costumes, everything that prevented me from persuading myself that I was contemplating the immemorial flood of ocean which had been moving with the same mysterious life before the appearance of the human race; and had grudged even the days of radiant sunshine which seemed to me to invest with the trivial aspect of the world’s universal summer this coast of fog and tempest, to mark simply an interruption, equivalent to what in music is known as a rest; now on the other hand it was the bad days that appeared to me to be some disastrous accident, a thing that could no longer find any place for itself in the world of beauty; I felt a keen desire to go out and recapture in reality what had so powerfully aroused my imagination, and I hoped that the weather would be propitious enough for me to see from the summit of the cliff the same blue shadows as were in Elstir’s picture

    Nor, as I went along, did I still make a frame about my eyes with my hands as in the days when, conceiving nature to be animated by a life anterior to the first appearance of man, and inconsistent with all those wearisome perfections of industrial achievement which had hitherto made me yawn with boredom at Universal Exhibitions or in the milliners’ windows, I endeavoured to include only that section of the sea over which there was no steamer passing, so that I might picture it to myself as immemorial, still contemporary with the ages in which it had been set apart from the land, or at least with the first dawn of life in Greece, which enabled me to repeat in their literal meaning the lines of ‘Father Leconte’ of which Bloch was so fond:

            ‘Gone are the Kings, gone are their towering prows
            Vanished upon the raging deep, alas
            The long-haired warrior heroes of Hellas.’

    I could no longer despise the milliners, now that Elstir had told me that the delicate touches by which they give a last refinement, a supreme caress to the ribbons or feathers of a hat after it is finished, would be as interesting to him to paint as the muscular action of the jockeys themselves (a statement which had delighted Albertine). But I must wait until I had returned — for milliners, to Paris — for regattas and races to Balbec, where there would be no more now until next year-. Even a yacht with women in white linen garments was not to be found

    Often we encountered Bloch’s sisters, to whom I was obliged to bow since I had dined with their father. My new friends did not know them. “I am not allowed to play with Israelites,” Albertine explained. Her way of pronouncing the word —‘Issraelites’ instead of ‘Izraelites’— would in itself have sufficed to shew, even if one had not heard the rest of the sentence, that it was no feeling of friendliness towards the chosen race that inspired these young Frenchwomen, brought up in God-fearing homes, and quite ready to believe that the Jews were in the habit of massacring Christian children. “Besides, they’re shocking bad form, your friends,” said Andrée with a smile which implied that she knew very well that they were no friends of mine. “Like everything to do with the tribe,” went on Albertine, in the sententious tone of one who spoke from personal experience. To tell the truth, Bloch’s sisters, at once overdressed and half naked, with their languishing, bold, blatant, sluttish air did not create the best impression. And one of their cousins, who was only fifteen, scandalised the Casino by her unconcealed admiration for Mlle. Lea, whose talent as an actress M. Bloch senior rated very high, but whose tastes were understood to lead her not exactly in the direction of the gentlemen

    Some days we took our refreshment at one of the outlying farms which catered to visitors. These were the farms known as Les Ecorres, Marie-Thérèse, La Croix d’Heuland, Bagatelle, Californie and Marie-Antoinette. It was the last that had been adopted by the little band

    But at other times, instead of going to a farm, we would climb to the highest point of the cliff, and, when we had reached it and were seated on the grass, would undo our parcel of sandwiches and cakes. My friends preferred the sandwiches, and were surprised to see me eat only a single chocolate cake, sugared with gothic tracery, or an apricot tart. This was because, with the sandwiches of cheese or of green-stuff, a form of food that was novel to me and knew nothing of the past, I had nothing in common. But the cakes understood, the tarts were gossips. There were in the former an insipid taste of cream, in the latter a fresh taste of fruit which knew all about Combray, and about Gilberte, not only the Gilberte of Combray but her too of Paris, at whose tea-parties I had found them again. They reminded me of those cake-plates of the Arabian Nights pattern, the subjects on which were such a distraction to my aunt Léonie when Françoise brought her up, one day, Aladdin or the Wonderful Lamp, another day Ali-Baba, or the Sleeper Awakes, or Sinbad the Sailor embarking at Bassorah with all his treasure. I should dearly have liked to see them again, but my grandmother did not know what had become of them, and thought moreover that they were just common plates that had been bought in the village. No matter, in that grey, midland Combray scene they and their pictures were set like many-coloured jewels, as in the dark church were the windows with their shifting radiance, as in the dusk of my bedroom were the projections cast by the magic-lantern, as in the foreground of the view of the railway-station and the little local line the buttercups from the Indies and the Persian lilacs, as were my great-aunt’s shelves of old porcelain in the sombre dwelling of an elderly lady in a country town

    Stretched out on the cliff I would see before me nothing but grassy meadows and beyond them not the seven heavens of the Christian cosmogony but two stages only, one of a deeper blue, the sea, and over it another more pale. We ate our food, and if I had brought with me also some little keepsake which might appeal to one or other of my friends, joy sprang with such sudden violence into her translucent face, flushed in an instant, that her lips had not the strength to hold it in, and to allow it to escape parted in a shout of laughter. They had gathered close round me, and between their faces which were almost touching one another the air that separated them traced azure pathways such as might have been cut by a gardener wishing to clear the ground a little so as to be able himself to move freely through a thicket of roses

    When we had finished eating we would play games which until then I should have thought boring, sometimes such childish games as King of the Castle, or Who Laughs First; not for a kingdom would I have renounced them now; the rosy dawn of adolescence, with which the faces of these girls were still aglow, and from which I, young as I was, had already emerged, shed its light on everything round about them and, like the fluid painting of some of the Primitives, brought out the most insignificant details of their daily lives in relief against a golden background. Even the faces of the girls were, for the most part, clouded with this misty effulgence of a dawn from which their actual features had not yet emerged. One saw only a charming sheet of colour beneath which what in a few years’ time would be a profile was not discernible. The profile of to-day had nothing definite about it, and could be only a momentary resemblance to some deceased member of the family to whom nature had paid this commemorative courtesy. It comes so soon, the moment when there is nothing left to wait for, when the body is fixed in an immobility which holds no fresh surprise in store, when one loses all hope on seeing — as on a tree in the height of summer leaves already brown — round a face still young hair that is growing thin or turning grey; it is so short, that radiant morning time that one comes to like only the very youngest girls, those in whom the flesh, like a precious leaven, is still at work. They are no more yet than a stream of ductile matter, moulded ever afresh by the fleeting impression of the moment. You would say that each of them was in turn a little statuette of childish gaiety, of a child grown earnest, coaxing, surprised, taking its pattern from an expression frank and complete, but fugitive. This plasticity gives a wealth of variety and charm to the pretty attentions which a little girl pays to us. Of course, such attentions are indispensable in the woman also, and she whom we do not attract, or who fails to let us see that we have attracted her, tends to assume in our eyes a somewhat tedious uniformity. But even these pretty attentions, after a certain age, cease to send gentle ripples over a face which the struggle for existence has hardened, has rendered unalterably militant or ecstatic. One — owing to the prolonged strain of the obedience that subjects wife to husband — will seem not so much a woman’s face as a soldier’s; another, carved by the sacrifices which a mother has consented to make, day after day, for her children, will be the face of an apostle. A third is, after a stormy passage through the years, the face of an ancient mariner, upon a body of which its garments alone indicate the sex. Certainly the attentions that a woman pays us can still, so long as we are in love with her, scatter fresh charms over the hours that we spend in her company. But she is not then for us a series of different women. Her gaiety remains external to an unchanging face. Whereas adolescence is anterior to this complete solidification; and from this it follows that we feel, in the company of young girls, the refreshing sense that is afforded us by the spectacle of forms undergoing an incessant process of change, a play of unstable forces which makes us think of that perpetual re-creation of the primordial elements of nature which we contemplate when we stand by the sea

    It was not merely a social engagement, a drive with Mme. de Villeparisis, that I would have sacrificed to the ‘Ferret’ or ‘Guessing Games’ of my friends. More than once, Robert de Saint-Loup had sent word that, since I was not coming to see him at Doncières, he had applied for twenty-four hours’ leave, which he would spend at Balbec. Each time I wrote back that he was on no account to come, offering the excuse that I should be obliged to be away myself that very day, when I had some duty call to pay with my grandmother on family friends in the neighbourhood. No doubt I fell in his estimation when he learned from his aunt in what the ‘duty call’ consisted, and who the persons were who combined to play the part of my grandmother. And yet I had not been wrong, perhaps, after all, in sacrificing not only the vain pleasures of the world but the real pleasure of friendship to that of spending the whole day in this green garden. People who enjoy the capacity — it is true that such people are artists, and I had long been convinced that I should never be that — are also under an obligation to live for themselves. And friendship is a dispensation from this duty, an abdication of self. Even conversation, which is the mode of expression of friendship, is a superficial digression which gives us no new acquisition. We may talk for a lifetime without doing more than indefinitely repeat the vacuity of a minute, whereas the march of thought in the solitary travail of artistic creation proceeds downwards, into the depths, in the only direction that is not closed to us, along which we are free to advance — though with more effort, it is true — towards a goal of truth. And friendship is not merely devoid of virtue, like conversation, it is fatal to us as well. For the sense of boredom which it is impossible not to feel in a friend’s company (when, that is to say, we must remain exposed on the surface of our consciousness, instead of pursuing our voyage of discovery into the depths) for those of us in whom the law of development is purely internal — that first impression of boredom our friendship impels us to correct when we are alone again, to recall with emotion the words uttered by our friend, to look upon them as a valuable addition to our substance, albeit we are not like buildings to which stones can be added from without, but like trees which draw from their own sap the knot that duly appears on their trunks, the spreading roof of their foliage. I was lying to myself, I was interrupting the process of growth in that direction in which I could indeed really be enlarged and made happy, when I congratulated myself on being liked, admired, by so good, so clever, so rare a creature as Saint-Loup, when I focussed my mind, not upon my own obscure impressions which duty bade me unravel, but on the words uttered by my friend, in which, when I repeated them to myself — when I had them repeated to me by that other self who dwells in us and on to whom we are always so ready to transfer the burden of taking thought — I strove to make myself find a beauty very different from that which I used to pursue in silence when I was really alone, but one that would enhance the merit of Robert, of myself, of my life. In the life which a friend like this provided for me, I seemed to myself to be comfortably preserved from solitude, nobly desirous of sacrificing myself for him, in fact quite incapable of realising myself. Among the girls, on the other hand, if the pleasure which I enjoyed was selfish, at least it was not based on the lie which seeks to make us believe that we are not irremediably alone, and which, when we talk to another person, prevents us from admitting that it is no longer we who speak, that we are fashioning ourselves in the likeness of strangers and not of our own ego, which is quite different from them. The words that passed between the girls of the little band and myself were not of any interest; they were, moreover, but few, broken by long spells of silence on my part. All of which did not prevent me from finding, in listening to them when they spoke to me, as much pleasure as in gazing at them, in discovering in the voice of each one of them a brightly coloured picture. It was with ecstasy that I caught their pipings. Love helps us to discern things, to discriminate. Standing in a wood, the lover of birds at once distinguishes the notes of the different species, which to ordinary people sound the same. The lover of girls knows that human voices vary even more. Each one possesses more notes than the richest instrument of music. And the combinations in which the voice groups those notes are as inexhaustible as the infinite variety of personalities. When I talked with any one of my friends I was conscious that the original, the unique portrait of her individuality had been skilfully traced, tyranically imposed on my mind as much by the inflexions of her voice as by those of her face, and that these were two separate spectacles which rendered, each in its own plane, the same single reality. No doubt the lines of the voice, like those of the face, were not yet definitely fixed; the voice had still to break, as the face to change. Just as children have a gland the secretion in which enables them to digest milk, a gland which is not found in grown men and women, so there were in the twitterings of these girls notes which women’s voices no longer contain. And on this instrument with its greater compass they played with their lips, shewing all the application, the ardour of Bellini’s little angel musicians, qualities which also are an exclusive appanage of youth. Later on these girls would lose that note of enthusiastic conviction which gave a charm to their simplest utterances, whether it were Albertine who, in a tone of authority, repeated puns to which the younger ones listened with admiration, until that wild impulse to laugh caught them all with the irresistible violence of a sneeze, or Andrée who began to speak of their work in the schoolroom, work even more childish seemingly than the games they played, with a gravity essentially puerile; and their words changed in tone, like the lyrics of ancient times when poetry, still hardly differentiated from music, was declaimed upon the different notes of a scale. In spite of which, the girls’ voices already gave a quite clear indication of the attitude that each of these little people had adopted towards life, an attitude so personal that it would be speaking in far too general terms to say of one: “She treats everything as a joke,” of another: “She jumps from assertion to assertion,” of a third: “She lives in a state of expectant hesitation.” The features of our face are hardly more than gestures which force of habit has made permanent. Nature, like the destruction of Pompeii, like the metamorphosis of a nymph into a tree, has arrested us in an accustomed movement. Similarly, our intonations embody our philosophy of life, what a person says to himself about things at any given moment. No doubt these peculiarities were to be found not only in the girls. They were those of their parents. The individual is a part of something that is more generally diffused than himself. By this reckoning, our parents furnish us not only with those habitual gestures which are the outlines of our face and voice, but also with certain mannerisms in speech, certain favourite expressions, which, almost as unconscious as an intonation, almost as profound, indicate likewise a definite point of view towards life. It is quite true, since we are speaking of girls, that there are certain of these expressions which their parents do not hand on to them until they have reached a certain age, as a rule not before they are women. These are kept in reserve. Thus, for instance, if you were to speak of the pictures of one of Elstir’s friends, Andrée, whose hair was still ‘down,’ could not yet make use, personally, of the expression which her mother and elder sister employed: “It appears, the man is quite charming!” But that would come in due course, when she was allowed to go to the Palais-Royal. And already, since her first communion, Albertine had begun to say, like a friend of her aunt: “I’m sure I should find that simply terrible!” She had also had given to her, as a little present, the habit of repeating whatever you had just been saying to her, so as to appear to be interested, and to be trying to form an opinion of her own. If you said that an artist’s work was good, or his house nice, “Oh, his work is good, is it?” “Oh, his house is nice, is it?” Last of all, and even more general than the family heritage, was the rich layer imposed by the native province from which they derived their voices and of which indeed their intonations smacked. When Andrée sharply struck a solemn note she could not prevent the Perigordian string of her vocal instrument from giving back a resonant sound quite in harmony, moreover, with the Meridional purity of her features; while to the incessant pranks of Rosemonde the substance of her North-Country face and voice responded, whatever her mood at the time, in the accent of their province. Between that province and the temperament of the little girl who dictated these inflexions, I caught a charming dialogue. A dialogue, not in any sense a discord. It would not have been possible to separate the girl herself and her native place. She was herself; she was still it also. Moreover this reaction of locally procured materials on the genius who utilises them and to whose work their reaction imparts an added freshness, does not make the work any less individual, and whether it be that of an architect, a cabinet-maker or a composer, it reflects no less minutely the most subtle shades of the artist’s personality, because he has been compelled to work in the millstone of Senlis or the red sandstone of Strasbourg, has respected the knots peculiar to the ash-tree, has borne in mind, when writing his score, the resources, the limitations, the volume of sound, the possibilities of flute or alto voice

    All this I realised, and yet we talked so little. Whereas with Mme. de Villeparisis or Saint-Loup I should have displayed by my words a great deal more pleasure than I should actually have felt, for I used always to be worn out when I parted from them; when, on the other hand, I was lying on the grass among all these girls, the plenitude of what I was feeling infinitely outweighed the paucity, the infrequency of our speech, and brimmed over from my immobility and silence in floods of happiness, the waves of which rippled up to die at the feet of these young roses

    For a convalescent who rests all day long in a flower-garden or orchard, a scent of flowers or fruit does not more completely pervade the thousand trifles that compose his idle hours than did for me that colour, that fragrance in search of which my eyes kept straying towards the girls, and the sweetness of which finally became incorporated in me. So it is that grapes grow sugary in sunshine. And by their slow continuity these simple little games had gradually wrought in me also, as in those who do nothing else all day but lie outstretched by the sea, breathing the salt air and growing sunburned, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague sense of dizziness that had spread from brain to eyes

    Now and then a pretty attention from one or another of them would stir in me vibrations which dissipated for a time my desire for the rest. Thus one day Albertine had suddenly asked: “Who has a pencil?” Andrée had provided one, Rosemonde the paper; Albertine had warned them: “Now, young ladies, you are not to look at what I write.” After carefully tracing each letter, supporting the paper on her knee, she had passed it to me with: “Take care no one sees.” Whereupon I had unfolded it and read her message, which was: “I love you.”

    “But we mustn’t sit here scribbling nonsense,” she cried, turning impetuously, with a sudden gravity of demeanour, to Andrée and Rosemonde

    “I ought to shew you the letter I got from Gisèle this morning. What an idiot I am; I’ve had it all this time in my pocket — and you can’t think how important it may be to us.” Gisèle had been moved to copy out for her friend, so that it might be passed on to the others, the essay which she had written in her certificate examination. Albertine’s fears as to the difficulty of the subjects set had been more than justified by the two from which Gisèle had had to choose. The first was: “Sophocles, from the Shades, writes to Racine to console him for the failure of Athalie“; the other: “Suppose that, after the first performance of Esther, Mme. de Sévigné is writing to Mme. de La Fayette to tell her how much she regretted her absence.” Now Gisèle, in an excess of zeal which ought to have touched the examiners’ hearts, had chosen the former, which was also the more difficult of the two subjects, and had handled it with such remarkable skill that she had been given fourteen marks, and had been congratulated by the board. She would have received her ‘mention’ if she had not ‘dried up’ in the Spanish paper. The essay, a copy of which Gisèle had now sent her, was immediately read aloud to us by Albertine, for, having presently to pass the same examination, she was anxious to have an opinion from Andrée, who was by far the cleverest of them all and might be able to give her some good ‘tips.’ “She did have a bit of luck!” was Albertine’s comment.“It’s the very subject her French mistress made her swot up while she was here.” The letter from Sophocles to Racine, as drafted by Gisèle, ran as follows: “My dear friend, You must pardon me the liberty of addressing you when I have not the honour of your personal acquaintance, but your latest tragedy, Athalie, shews, does it not, that you have made the most thorough study of my own modest works. You have not only put poetry in the mouths of the protagonists, or principal persons of the drama, but you have written other, and, let me tell you without flattery, charming verses for the choruses, a feature which was not too bad, according to all one hears, in Greek Tragedy, but is a complete novelty in France. Nay more, your talent always so fluent, so finished, so winning, so fine, so delicate, has here acquired an energy on which I congratulate you. Athalie, Joad — these are figures which your rival Corneille could have wrought no better. The characters are virile, the plot simple and strong. You have given us a tragedy in which love is not the keynote, and on this I must offer you my sincerest compliments. The most familiar proverbs are not always the truest. I will give you an example:

            ‘This passion treat, which makes the poet’s art
            Fly, as on wings, straight to the listener’s heart.’

    You have shewn us that the religious sentiment in which your choruses are steeped is no less capable of moving us. The general public may have been puzzled at first, but those who are best qualified to judge must give you your due. I have felt myself impelled to offer you all my congratulations, to which I would add, my dear brother poet, an expression of my very highest esteem.” Albertine’s eyes, while she was reading this to us, had not ceased to sparkle. “Really, you’d think she must have cribbed it somewhere!” she exclaimed, as she reached the end. “I should never have believed that Gisèle could hatch out anything like as good! And the poetry she brings in! Where on earth can she have got that from?” Albertine’s admiration, with a change, it is true, of object, but with no loss — an increase, rather — of intensity, combined with the closest attention to what was being said, continued to make her eyes ‘start from her head’ all the time that Andrée (consulted as being the biggest of the band and more knowledgeable than the others) first of all spoke of Gisèle’s essay with a certain irony, then with a levity of tone which failed to conceal her underlying seriousness proceeded to reconstruct the letter in her own way. “It is not badly done,” she told Albertine, “but if I were you and had the same subject set me, which is quite likely, as they do very often set that, I shouldn’t do it in that way. This is how I would tackle it. Well, first of all, if I had been Gisèle, I should not have let myself get tied up, I should have begun by making a rough sketch of what I was going to write on a separate piece of paper. On the top line I should state the question and give an account of the subject, then the general ideas to be worked into the development. After that, appreciation, style, conclusion. In that way, with a summary to refer to, you know where you are. But at the very start, where she begins her account of the subject, or, if you like, Titine, since it’s a letter we’re speaking of, where she comes to the matter, Gisèle has gone off the rails altogether. Writing to a person of the seventeenth century, Sophocles ought never to have said, ‘My dear friend.’” “Why, of course, she ought to have said, ‘My dear Racine,’” came impetuously from Albertine. “That would have been much better.” “No,” replied Andrée, with a trace of mockery in her tone, “she ought to have put ‘Sir.’ In the same way, to end up, she ought to have thought of something like, ‘Suffer me, Sir,’ (at the very most, ‘Dear Sir’) to inform you of the sense of high esteem with which I have the honour to be your servant.’ Then again, Gisèle says that the choruses in Athalie are a novelty. She is forgetting Esther, and two tragedies that are not much read now but happen to have been analysed this year by the Professor himself, so that you need only mention them, since he’s got them on the brain, and you’re bound to pass. I mean Les Juives, by Robert Gamier, and Montchrestien’s L’Aman.” Andrée quoted these titles without managing quite to conceal a secret sense of benevolent superiority, which found expression in a smile, quite a delightful smile, for that matter. Albertine could contain herself no — longer. “Andrée, you really are a perfect marvel,” she cried. “You must write down those names for me. Just fancy, what luck it would be if I got on to that, even in the oral, I should bring them in at once and make a colossal impression.” But in the days that followed, every time that Albertine begged Andrée just to tell her again the names of those two plays so that she might write them down, her blue-stocking friend seemed most unfortunately to have forgotten them, and left her none the wiser. “And another thing,” Andrée went on with the faintest note in her voice of scorn for companions so much younger than herself, though she relished their admiration and attached to the manner in which she herself would have composed the essay a greater importance than she wanted us to think, “Sophocles in the Shades must be kept well-informed of all that goes on. He must know, therefore, that it was not before the general public but before the King’s Majesty and a few privileged courtiers that Athalie was first played. What Gisèle says in this connexion of the esteem of qualified judges is not at all bad, but she might have gone a little further. Sophocles, now that he is immortal, might quite well have the gift of prophecy and announce that, according to Voltaire,Athalie is to be the supreme achievement not of Racine merely but of the human mind.” Albertine was drinking in every word. Her eyes blazed. And it was with the utmost indignation that she rejected Rosemonde’s suggestion that they should begin to play. “And so,” Andrée concluded, in the same easy, detached tone, blending a faint sneer with a certain warmth of conviction, “if Gisèle had noted down properly, first of all, the general ideas that she was going to develop, it might perhaps have occurred to her to do what I myself should have done, point out what a difference there is between the religious inspiration of Sophocles’s choruses and Racine’s. I should have made Sophocles remark that if Racine’s choruses are instinct with religious feeling like those of the Greek Tragedians, the gods are not the same. The God of Joad has nothing in common with the god of Sophocles. And that brings us quite naturally, when we have finished developing the subject, to our conclusion: What does it matter if their beliefs are different? Sophocles would hesitate to insist upon such a point. He would be afraid of wounding Racine’s convictions, and so, slipping in a few appropriate words on his masters at Port-Royal, he prefers to congratulate his disciple on the loftiness of his poetic genius.”

    Admiration and attention had so heated Albertine that great drops were rolling down her cheeks. Andrée preserved the unruffled calm of a female dandy. “It would not be a bad thing either to quote some of the opinions of famous critics,” she added, before they began their game. “Yes,” put in Albertine, “so I’ve been told. The best ones to quote, on the whole, are Sainte-Beuve and Merlet, aren’t they?” “Well, you’re not absolutely wrong,” Andrée told her, “Merlet and Sainte-Beuve are by no means bad. But you certainly ought to mention Deltour and Gascq-Desfossés.” She refused, however, despite Albertine’s entreaties, to write down these two unfamiliar names

    Meanwhile I had been thinking of the little page torn from a scribbling block which Albertine had handed me. “I love you,” she had written. And an hour later, as I scrambled down the paths which led back, a little too vertically for my liking, to Balbec, I said to myself that it was with her that I would have my romance

    The state of being indicated by the presence of all the signs by which we are accustomed to recognise that we are in love, such as the orders which I left in the hotel not to awaken me whoever might ask to see me, unless it were one or other of the girls, the beating of my heart while I waited for her (whichever of them it might be that I was expecting) and on those mornings my fury if I had not succeeded in finding a barber to shave me, and must appear with the disfigurement of a hairy chin before Albertine, Rosemonde or Andrée, no doubt this state, recurring indifferently at the thought of one or another, was as different from what we call love as is from human life the life of the zoophytes, where an existence, an individuality, if we may term it, is divided up among several organisms. But natural history teaches us that such an organization of animal life is indeed to be observed, and that our own life, provided only that we have outgrown the first phase, is no less positive as to the reality of states hitherto unsuspected by us, through which we have to pass, and can then abandon them altogether. Such was for me this state of love divided among several girls at once. Divided — say rather undivided, for more often than not what was so delicious to me, different from the rest of the world, what was beginning to become so precious to me that the hope of finding it again on the morrow was the greatest happiness in my life, was rather the whole of the group of girls, taken as they were all together on those afternoons on the cliffs, during those lifeless hours, upon that strip of grass on which were laid those forms, so exciting to my imagination, of Albertine, Rosemonde, Andrée; and that without my being able to say which of them it was that made those scenes so precious to me, which of them I was most anxious to love. At the start of a new love as at its ending, we are not exclusively attached to the object of that love, but rather the desire to be loving from which it will presently emerge (and, later on, the memory which it leaves behind) wanders voluptuously through a zone of interchangeable charms — simply natural charms, it may be, gratification of appetite, enjoyment of one’s surroundings — which are so far harmonised among themselves that it does not in the presence of any one of them feel itself out of place. Besides, as my perception of them was not yet dulled by familiarity, I had still the faculty of seeing them, that is to say of feeling a profound astonishment every time that I found myself in their presence. No doubt this astonishment is to some extent due to the fact that the other person on such occasions presents himself in a fresh aspect; but so great is the multiformity of each of us, so abundant the wealth of lines of face and body, lines so few of which leave any trace, once we have parted from the other person, on the arbitrary simplicity of our memory. As our mind has selected some peculiarity that had struck us, has isolated it, exaggerated it, making of a woman who has appeared to us tall, a sketch in which her figure is absurdly elongated, or of a woman who has seemed to be pink-cheeked and golden-haired a pure ‘Harmony in pink and gold,’ so, the moment that woman is once again standing before us, all the other forgotten qualities which restore the balance of that one remembered feature at once assail us, in their confused complexity, diminishing her height, paling her cheeks, and substituting for what we have come to her solely to seek other peculiarities which we remember now that we did notice the first time, and fail to understand how we can so far have forgotten to look out for again. We thought we remembered; it was a peahen, surely; we go to see it and find a peony. And this inevitable astonishment is not the only one; for, side by side with it comes another, born of the difference, not now between the stereotyped forms of memory and reality, but between the person whom we saw last time and him who appears to us to-day from another angle and shews us another aspect. The human face is indeed, like the face of the God of some Oriental theogony, a whole cluster of faces, crowded together but on different surfaces so that one does not see them all at once

    But to a great extent our astonishment springs from the other person’s presenting to us also a face that is the same as before. It would require so immense an effort to reconstruct everything that has been imparted to us by things other than ourselves — were it only the taste of a fruit — that no sooner is the impression received than we begin imperceptibly to descend the slope of memory and, without noticing anything, in a very short time, we have come a long way from what we actually felt. So that every fresh encounter is a sort of rectification, which brings us back to what we really did see. We have no longer any recollection of this, to such an extent does what we call remembering a person consist really in forgetting him. But so long as we can still see at the moment when the forgotten aspect appears, we recognise it, we are obliged to correct the straying line; thus the perpetual and fruitful surprise which made so salutary and invigorating for me these daily outings with the charming damsels of the sea shore, consisted fully as much in recognition as in discovery. When there is added to this the agitation aroused by what these girls were to me, which was never quite what I had supposed, and meant that my expectancy of our next meeting resembled not so much my expectancy the time before as the still throbbing memory of our latest conversation, it will be realised that each of our excursions made a violent interruption in the course of my thoughts and moved them clean out of the direction which, in the solitude of my own room, I had been able to trace for them at my leisure. That plotted course was forgotten, had ceased to exist, when I returned home buzzing like a hive of bees with remarks which had disquieted me when I heard them and were still echoing in my brain. The other person is destroyed when we cease to see him; after which his next appearance means a fresh creation of him, different from that which immediately preceded it, if not from them all. For the minimum variation that is to be found in these creations is duality. If we have in mind a strong and searching glance, a bold manner, it is inevitably, next time, by a half-languid profile, a sort of dreamy gentleness, overlooked by us in our previous impression, that we shall be, on meeting him again, astonished, that is to say almost solely struck. In confronting our memory with the new reality it is this that will mark the extent of our disappointment or surprise, will appear to us like the revised version of an earlier reality warning us that we had not remembered it correctly. In its turn, the facial aspect neglected the time before, and for that very reason the most striking this time, the most real, the most documentary, will become a matter for dreams and memories. It is a languorous and rounded profile, a gentle, dreamy expression which we shall now desire to see again. And then, next time, such resolution, such strength of character as there may be in the piercing eyes, the pointed nose, the tight lips, will come to correct the discrepancy between our desire and the object to which it has supposed itself to correspond. It is understood, of course, that this loyalty to the first and purely physical impressions which I formed afresh at each encounter with my friends did not involve only their facial appearance, since the reader has seen that I was sensible also of their voices, more disquieting still, perhaps (for not only does a voice offer the same strange and sensuous surfaces as a face, it issues from that unknown, inaccessible region the mere thought of which sets the mind swimming with unattainable kisses), their voices each like the unique sound of a little instrument into which the player put all her artistry and which was found only in her possession. Traced by a casual inflexion, a sudden deep chord in one of their voices would astonish me when I recognised after having forgotten it. So much so that the corrections which after every fresh meeting I was obliged to make so as to ensure absolute accuracy were as much those of a tuner or singing-master as a draughtsman’s

    As for the harmonious cohesion in which had been neutralised for some time, by the resistance that each brought to bear against the expansion of the others, the several waves of sentiment set in motion in me by these girls, it was broken in Albertine’s favour one afternoon when we were playing the game of ‘ferret.’ It was in a little wood on the cliff. Stationed between two girls, strangers to the little band, whom the band had brought in its train because we wanted that day to have a bigger party than usual, I gazed enviously at Albertine’s neighbour, a young man, saying to myself that if I had been in his place I could have been touching my friend’s hands all those miraculous moments which might perhaps never recur, and that this would have been but the first stage in a great advance. Already, by itself, and even without the consequences which it would probably have involved, the contact of Albertine’s hands would have been delicious to me. Not that I had never seen prettier hands than hers. Even in the group of her friends, those of Andrée, slender hands and much more finely modelled, had as it were a private life of their own, obedient to the commands of their mistress, but independent, and used often to strain out before her like a leash of thoroughbred greyhounds, with lazy pauses, long dreams, sudden stretchings of a joint, seeing which Elstir had made a number of studies of these hands. And in one of them, in which you saw Andrée warming her hands at the fire, they had, with the light behind them, the gilded transparency of two autumn leaves. But, plumper than these, the hands of Albertine would yield for a moment, then resist the pressure of the hand that clasped them, giving a sensation that was quite peculiar to themselves. The act of pressing Albertine’s hand had a sensual sweetness which was in keeping somehow with the rosy, almost mauve colouring of her skin. That pressure seemed to allow you to penetrate into the girl’s being, to plumb the depths of her senses, like the ringing sound of her laughter, indecent as may be the cooing of doves or certain animal cries. She was the sort of woman with whom shaking hands affords so much pleasure that one feels grateful to civilisation for having made of the handclasp a lawful act between young men and girls when they meet. If the arbitrary code of good manners had replaced the clasp of hands by some other gesture, I should have gazed, day after day, at the unattainable hands of Albertine with a curiosity to know the feel of them as ardent as was my curiosity to learn the savour of her cheeks. But in the pleasure of holding her hand unrestrictedly in mine, had I been next to her at ‘ferret’ I did not envisage that pleasure alone; what avowals, declarations silenced hitherto by my bashfulness, I could have conveyed by certain pressures of hand on hand; on her side, how easy it would have been for her, in responding by other pressures, to shew me that she accepted; what complicity, what a vista of happiness stood open! My love would be able to make more advance in a few minutes spent thus by her side than it had yet made in all the time that I had known her. Feeling that they would last but a short time, were rapidly nearing their end, since presumably we were not going on much longer with this game, and that once it was over I should be too late, I could not keep in my place for another moment. I let myself deliberately be caught with the ring, and, having gone into the middle, when the ring passed I pretended not to see it but followed its course with my eyes, waiting for the moment when it should come into the hands of the young man next to Albertine, who herself, pealing with helpless laughter, and in the excitement and pleasure of the game, was blushing like a rose. “Why, we really are in the Fairy Wood!” said Andrée to me, pointing to the trees that grew all round, with a smile in her eyes which was meant only for me and seemed to pass over the heads of the other players, as though we two alone were clever enough to double our parts, and make, in connexion with the game we were playing, a remark of a poetic nature. She even carried the delicacy of her fancy so far as to sing half-unconsciously: “The Ferret of the Wood has passed this way, Sweet Ladies; he has passed by this way, the Ferret of Fairy Wood!” like those people who cannot visit Trianon without getting up a party in Louis XVI costume, or think in effective to have a song sung to its original setting. I should no doubt have been sorry that I could see no charm in this piece of mimicry, had I had time to think of it. But my thoughts were all elsewhere. The players began to shew surprise at my stupidity in never getting the ring. I was looking at Albertine, so pretty, so indifferent, so gay, who, though she little knew it, was to be my neighbour when at last I should catch the ring in the right hands, thanks to a stratagem which she did not suspect, and would certainly have resented if she had. In the heat of the game her long hair had become loosened, and fell in curling locks over her cheeks on which it served to intensify, by its dry brownness, the carnation pink. “You have the tresses of Laura Dianti, of Eleanor of Guyenne, and of her descendant so beloved of Chateaubriand. You ought always to wear your hair half down like that,” I murmured in her ear as an excuse for drawing close to her. Suddenly the ring passed to her neighbour. I sprang upon him at once, forced open his hands and seized it; he was obliged now to take my place inside the circle, while I took his beside Albertine. A few minutes earlier I had been envying this young man, when I saw that his hands as they slipped over the cord were constantly brushing against hers. Now that my turn was come, too shy to seek, too much moved to enjoy this contact, I no longer felt anything save the rapid and painful beating of my heart. At one moment Albertine leaned towards me, with an air of connivance, her round and rosy face, making a show of having the ring, so as to deceive the ferret, and keep him from looking in the direction in which she was just going to pass it. I realised at once that this was the sole object of Albertine’s mysterious, confidential gaze, but I was a little shocked to see thus kindle in her eyes the image — purely fictitious, invented to serve the needs of the game — of a secret, an understanding between her and myself which did not exist, but which from that moment seemed to me to be possible and would have been divinely sweet. While I was still being swept aloft by this thought, I felt a slight pressure of Albertine’s hand against mine, and her caressing finger slip under my finger along the cord, and I saw her, at the same moment, give me a wink which she tried to make pass unperceived by the others. At once, a mass of hopes, invisible hitherto by myself, crystallised within me. “She is taking advantage of the game to let me feel that she really does love me,” I thought to myself, in an acme of joy, from which no sooner had I reached it than I fell, on hearing Albertine mutter furiously: “Why can’t you take it? I’ve been shoving it at you for the last hour.” Stunned with grief, I let go the cord, the ferret saw that ring and swooped down on it, and I had to go back into the middle, where I stood helpless, in despair, looking at the unbridled rout which continued to circle round me, stung by the jeering shouts of all the players, obliged, in reply, to laugh when I had so little mind for laughter, while Albertine kept on repeating: “People can’t play if they don’t pay attention, and spoil the game for the others. He shan’t be asked again when we’re going to play, Andrée; if he is, I don’t come.” Andrée, with a mind above the game, still chanting her ‘Fairy Wood’ which, in a spirit of imitation, Rosemonde had taken up too, but without conviction, sought to make a diversion from Albertine’s reproaches by saying to me: “We’re quite close to those old Creuniers you wanted so much to see. Look, I’ll take you there by a dear little path, and we’ll leave these silly idiots to go on playing like babies in the nursery.” As Andrée was extremely nice to me, as we went along I said to her everything about Albertine that seemed calculated to make me attractive to the latter. Andrée replied that she too was very fond of Albertine, thought her charming; in spite of which the compliments that I was paying to her friend did not seem altogether to please her. Suddenly, in the little sunken path, I stopped short, touched to the heart by an exquisite memory of my childhood. I had just recognised, by the fretted and glossy leaves which it thrust out towards me, a hawthorn-bush, flowerless, alas, now that spring was over. Around me floated the atmosphere of far-off Months of Mary, of Sunday afternoons, of beliefs, or errors long ago forgotten. I wanted to stay it in its passage. I stood still for a moment, and Andrée, with a charming divination of what was in my mind, left me to converse with the leaves of the bush. I asked them for news of the flowers, those hawthorn flowers that were like merry little girls, headstrong, provocative, pious. “The young ladies have been gone from here for a long time now,” the leaves told me. And perhaps they thought that, for the great friend of those young ladies that I pretended to be, I seemed to have singularly little knowledge of their habits. A great friend, but one who had never been to see them again for all these years, despite his promises. And yet, as Gilberte had been my first love among girls, so these had been my first love among flowers. “Yes, I know all that, they leave about the middle of June,” I answered, “but I am so delighted to see the place where they stayed when they were here. They came to see me, too, at Combray, in my room; my mother brought them when I was ill in bed. And we used to meet on Saturday evenings, too, at the Month of Mary devotions. Can they get to them from here?” “Oh, of course! Why, they make a special point of having our young ladies at Saint-Denis du Désert, the church near here.” “Then, if I want to see them now?” “Oh, not before May, next year.” “But I can be sure that they will be here?” “They come regularly every year.” “Only I don’t know whether it will be easy to find the place.” “Oh, dear, yes! They are so gay, the young ladies, they stop laughing only to sing hymns together, so that you can’t possibly miss them, you can tell by the scent from the other end of the path.”

    I caught up Andrée, and began again to sing Albertine’s praises. It was inconceivable to me that she would not repeat what I said to her friend, seeing the emphasis that I put into it. And yet I never heard that Albertine had been told. Andrée had, nevertheless, a far greater understanding of the things of the heart, a refinement of nice behaviour; finding the look, the word, the action that could most ingeniously give pleasure, keeping to herself a remark that might possibly cause pain, making a sacrifice (and making it as though it were no sacrifice at all) of an afternoon’s play, or it might be an ‘at home’ or a garden party in order to stay beside a friend who was feeling sad, and thus shew him or her that she preferred the simple company of a friend to frivolous pleasures; these were her habitual delicacies. But when one knew her a little better one would have said that it was with her as with those heroic cravens who wish not to be afraid, and whose bravery is especially meritorious, one would have said that in her true character there was none of that generosity which she displayed at every moment out of moral distinction, or sensibility, or a noble desire to shew herself a true friend. When I listened to all the charming things she was saying to me about a possible affection between Albertine and myself it seemed as though she were bound to do everything in her power to bring it to pass. Whereas, by mere chance perhaps, not even of the least of the various minor opportunities which were at her disposal and might have proved effective in uniting me to Albertine did she ever make any use, and I would not swear that my effort to make myself loved by Albertine did not — if not provoke in her friend secret stratagems destined to bring it to nought — at any rate arouse in her an anger which however she took good care to hide and against which even, in her delicacy of feeling, she may herself have fought. Of the countless refinements of goodness which Andrée shewed Albertine would have been incapable, and yet I was not certain of the underlying goodness of the former as I was to be, later on, of the latter’s. Shewing herself always tenderly indulgent to the exuberant frivolity of Albertine, Andrée would greet her with speeches, with smiles which were those of a friend, better still, she always acted towards her as a friend. I have seen her, day after day, in order to give the benefit of her own wealth, to bring some happiness to this penniless friend take, without any possibility of advantage to herself, more pains than a courtier would take who sought to win his sovereign’s favour. She was charmingly gentle always, charming in her choice of sweet, pathetic expressions, when you said to her what a pity it was that Albertine was so poor, and took infinitely more trouble on her behalf than she would have taken for a wealthy friend. But if anyone were to hint that Albertine was perhaps not quite so poor as people made out, a just discernible cloud would veil the light of Andrée’s eyes and brow; she seemed out of temper. And if you went on to say that after all Albertine might perhaps be less difficult to marry off than people supposed, she would vehemently contradict you, repeating almost angrily: “Oh dear, no; she will never get married! I am quite certain of it; it is a dreadful worry to me!” In so far as I myself was concerned, Andrée was the only one of the girls who would never have repeated to me anything not very pleasant that might have been said about me by a third person; more than that, if it were I who told her what had been said she would make a pretence of not believing it, or would furnish some explanation which made the remark inoffensive; it is the aggregate of these qualities that goes by the name of tact. Tact is the attribute of those people who, if we have called a man out in a duel, congratulate us and add that there was no necessity, really; so as to enhance still further in our own eyes the courage of which we have given proof without having been forced to do lo. They are the opposite of the people who, in similar circumstances, say: “It must have been a horrid nuisance for you, fighting a duel, but on the other hand you couldn’t possibly swallow an insult like that, there was nothing else to be done.” But as there, is always something to be said on both sides, if the pleasure, or at least the indifference shewn by our friends in repeating something offensive that they have heard said about us, proves that they do not exactly put themselves in our skin at the moment of speaking, but thrust in the pin-point, turn the knife-blade as though it were gold-beater’s skin and not human, the art of always keeping hidden from us what might be disagreeable to us in what they have heard said about our actions, or in the opinion which those actions have led the speakers themselves to form of us, proves that there is in the other kind of friends, in the friends who are so full of tact, a strong vein of dissimulation. It does no harm if indeed they are incapable of thinking evil, and if what is said by other people only makes them suffer as it would make us. I supposed this to be the case with Andrée, without, however, being absolutely sure

    We had left the little wood and had followed a network of overgrown paths through which Andrée managed to find her way with great skill. Suddenly, “Look now,” she said to me, “there are your famous Creuniers, and, I say, you are in luck, it’s just the time of day, and the light is the same as when Elstir painted them.” But I was still too wretched at having fallen, during the game of ‘ferret,’ from such a pinnacle of hopes. And so it was not with the pleasure which otherwise I should doubtless have felt that I caught sight, almost below my feet, crouching among the rocks, where they had gone for protection from the heat, of marine goddesses for whom Elstir had lain in wait and surprised them there, beneath a dark glaze as lovely as Leonardo would have painted, the marvellous Shadows, sheltered and furtive, nimble and voiceless, ready at the first glimmer of light to slip behind the stone, to hide in a cranny, and prompt, once the menacing ray had passed, to return to rock or seaweed beneath the sun that crumbled the cliffs and the colourless ocean, over whose slumbers they seemed to be watching, motionless lightfoot guardians letting appear on the water’s surface their viscous bodies and the attentive gaze of their deep blue eyes

    We went back to the wood to pick up the other girls and go home together. I knew now that I was in love with Albertine; but, alas! I had no thought of letting her know it. This was because, since the days of our games in the Champs-Elysées, my conception of love had become different, even if the persons to whom my love was successively assigned remained practically the same. For one thing, the avowal, the declaration of my passion to her whom I loved no longer seemed to me one of the vital and necessary incidents of love, nor love itself an external reality, but simply a subjective pleasure. And as for this pleasure, I felt that Albertine would do everything necessary to furnish it, all the more since she would not know that I was enjoying it

    As we walked home the image of Albertine, bathed in the light that streamed from the other girls, was not the only one that existed for me. But as the moon, which is no more than a tiny white cloud of a more definite and fixed shape than other clouds during the day, assumes her full power as soon as daylight dies, so when I was once more in the hotel it was Albertine’s sole image that rose from my heart and began to shine. My room seemed to me to have become suddenly a new place. Of course, for a long time past, it had not been the hostile room of my first night in it. All our lives we go on patiently modifying the surroundings in which we dwell; and gradually, as habit dispenses us from feeling them, we suppress the noxious elements of colour, shape and smell which were at the root of our discomfort. Nor was it any longer the room, still potent enough over my sensibility, not certainly to make me suffer, but to give me joy, the fount of summer days, like a marble basin in which, half way up its polished sides, they mirrored an azure surface steeped in light over which glided for an instant, impalpable and white as a wave of heat, a shadowy and fleeting cloud; not the room, wholly aesthetic, of the pictorial evening hours; it was the room in which I had been now for so many days that I no longer saw it. And now I was just beginning again to open my eyes to it, but this time from the selfish angle which is that of love. I liked to feel that the fine big mirror across one corner, the handsome bookcases with their fronts of glass would give Albertine, if she came to see me, a good impression of myself. Instead of a place of transit in which I would stay for a few minutes before escaping to the beach or to Rivebelle, my room became real and dear to me, fashioned itself anew, for I looked at and appreciated each article of its furniture with the eyes of Albertine

    A few days after the game of ‘ferret,’ when, having allowed ourselves to wander rather too far afield, we had been fortunate in finding at Maine-ville a couple of little “tubs” with two seats in each which would enable us to be back in time for dinner, the keenness, already intense, of my love for Albertine, had the following effect, first of all, that it was Rosemonde and Andrée in turn that I invited to be my companion, and never once Albertine, after which, in spite of my manifest preference for Andrée or Rosemonde, I led everybody, by secondary considerations of time and distance, cloaks and so forth, to decide, as though against my wishes, that the most practical policy was that I should take Albertine, to whose company I pretended to resign myself for good or ill. Unfortunately, since love tends to the complete assimilation of another person, while other people are not comestible by way of conversation alone, Albertine might be (and indeed was) as friendly as possible to me on our way home; when I had deposited her at her own door she left me happy but more famished for her even than I had been at the start, and reckoning the moments that we had spent together as only à prelude, of little importance in itself, to those that were still to come. And yet this prelude had that initial charm which is not to be found again. I had not yet asked anything of Albertine. She could imagine what I wanted, but, not being certain of it, would suppose that I was tending only towards relations without any definite purpose, in which my friend would find that delicious vagueness, rich in surprising fulfilments of expectations, which is true romance

    In the week that followed I scarcely attempted to see Albertine. I made a show of preferring Andrée. Love is born; one would like to remain, for her whom one loves, the unknown whom she may love in turn, but one has need of her, one requires contact not so much with her body as with her attention, her heart. One slips into a letter some spiteful expression which will force the indifferent reader to ask for some little kindness in compensation, and love, following an unvarying procedure, sets going with an alternating movement the machinery in which one can no longer either refrain from loving or be loved. I gave to Andrée the hours spent by the others at a party which I knew that she would sacrifice for my sake, with pleasure, and would have sacrificed even with reluctance, from a moral nicety, so as not to let either the others or herself think that she attached any importance to a relatively frivolous amusement. I arranged in this way to have her entirely to myself every evening, meaning not to make Albertine jealous, but to improve my position in her eyes, or at any rate not to imperil it by letting Albertine know that it was herself and not Andrée that I loved. Nor did I confide this to Andrée either, lest she should repeat it to her friend. When I spoke of Albertine to Andrée I affected a coldness by which she was perhaps less deceived that I by her apparent credulity. She made a show of believing in my indifference to Albertine, of desiring the closest possible union between Albertine and myself. It is probable that, on the contrary, she neither believed in the one nor wished for the other. While I was saying to her that I did not care very greatly for her friend, I was thinking of one thing only, how to become acquainted with Mme. Bontemps, who was staying for a few days near Balbec, and to whom Albertine was going presently on a short visit. Naturally I did not let Andrée become aware of this desire, and when I spoke to her of Albertine’s people, it was in the most careless manner possible. Andrée’s direct answers did not appear to throw any doubt on my sincerity. Why then did she blurt out suddenly, about that time: “Oh, guess who’ I’ve just seen — Albertine’s aunt!” It is true that she had not said in so many words: “I could see through your casual remarks all right that the one thing you were really thinking of was how you could make friends with Albertine’s aunt.” But it was clearly to the presence in Andrée’s mind of some such idea which she felt it more becoming to keep from me that the word ‘just’ seemed to point. It was of a kind with certain glances, certain gestures which, for all that they have not a form that is logical, rational, deliberately calculated to match the listener’s intelligence, reach him nevertheless in their true significance, just as human speech, converted into electricity in the telephone, is turned into speech again when it strikes the ear. In order to remove from Andree’s mind the idea that I was interested in Mme. Bontemps, I spoke of her from that time onwards not only carelessly but with downright malice, saying that I had once met that idiot of a woman, and trusted I should never have that experience again. Whereas I was seeking by every means in my power to meet her

    tried to induce Elstir (but without mentioning to anyone else that I had asked him) to speak to her about me and to bring us together. He promised to introduce me to her, though he seemed greatly surprised at my wishing it, for he regarded her as a contemptible woman, a born intriguer, as little interesting as she was disinterested. Reflecting that if I did see Mme. Bontemps, Andrée would be sure to hear of it sooner or later, I thought it best to warn her in advance. “The things one tries hardest to avoid are what one finds one cannot escape,” I told her. “Nothing in the world could bore me so much as meeting Mme. Bontemps again, and yet I can’t get out of it, Elstir has arranged to invite us together.” “I have never doubted it for a single instant,” exclaimed Andrée in a bitter tone, while her eyes, enlarged and altered by her annoyance, focussed themselves upon some invisible object. These words of Andree’s were not the most recent statement of a thought which might be expressed thus: “I know that you are in love with Albertine, and that you are working day and night to get in touch with her people.” But they were the shapeless fragments, easily pieced together again by me, of some such thought which I had exploded by striking it, through the shield of Andree’s self-control. Like her ‘just,’ these words had no meaning save in the second degree, that is to say they were words of the sort which (rather than direct affirmatives) inspires in us respect or distrust for another person, and leads to a rupture

    If Andrée had not believed me when I told her that Albertine’s relatives left me indifferent, that was because she thought that I was in love with Albertine. And probably she was none too happy in the thought

    She was generally present as a third party at my meetings with her friend. And yet there were days when I was to see Albertine by herself, days to which I looked forward with feverish impatience, which passed without bringing me any decisive result, without having, any of them, been that cardinal day whose part I immediately entrusted to the day that was to follow, which would prove no more apt to play it; thus there crumbled and collapsed, one after another, like waves of the sea, those peaks at once replaced by others

    About a month after the day on which we had played ‘ferret’ together, I learned that Albertine was going away next morning to spend a couple of days with Mme. Bontemps, and, since she would have to start early, was coming to sleep that night at the Grand Hotel, from which, by taking the omnibus, she would be able, without disturbing the friends with whom she was staying, to catch the first train in the morning. I mentioned this to Andrée. “I don’t believe a word of it,” she replied, with a look of annoyance. “Anyhow it won’t help you at all, for I’m quite sure Albertine won’t want to see you if she goes to the hotel by herself. It wouldn’t be ‘regulation,’” she added, employing an epithet which had recently come into favour with her, in the sense of ‘what is done.’ “I tell you this because I understand Albertine. What difference do you suppose it makes to me, whether you see her or not? Not the slightest, I can assure you!”

    We were joined by Octave who had no hesitation in telling Andrée the number of strokes he had gone round in, the day before, at golf, then by Albertine, counting her diabolo as she walked along, like a nun telling her beads. Thanks to this pastime she could be left alone for hours on end without growing bored. As soon as she joined us I became conscious of the obstinate tip of her nose, which I had omitted from my mental pictures of her during the last few days; beneath her dark hair the vertical front of her brow controverted — and not for the first time — the indefinite image that I had preserved of her, while its whiteness made a vivid splash in my field of vision; emerging from the dust of memory, Albertine was built up afresh before my eyes. Golf gives one a taste for solitary pleasures. The pleasure to be derived from diabolo is undoubtedly one of these. And yet, after she had joined us, Albertine continued to toss up and catch her missile, just as a lady on whom friends have come to call does not on their account stop working at her crochet. “I hear that Mme. de Villeparisis,” she remarked to Octave, “has been complaining to your father.” I could hear, underlying the word, one of those notes that were peculiar to Albertine; always, just as I had made certain that I had forgotten them, I would be reminded of a glimpse caught through them before of Albertine’s determined and typically Gallic mien. I might have been blind, and yet have detected certain of her qualities, alert and slightly provincial, from those notes, just as plainly as from the tip of her nose. These were equivalent and might have been substituted for one another, and her voice was like what we are promised in the photo-telephone of the future; the visual image was clearly outlined in the sound. “She’s not written only to your father, either, she wrote to the Mayor of Balbec at the same time, to say that we must stop playing diabolo on the ‘front’ as somebody hit her in the face with one.” “Yes, I was hearing about that. It’s too silly. There’s little enough to do here as it is.” Andrée did not join in the conversation; she was not acquainted, any more than was Albertine or Octave, with Mme. de Villeparisis. She did, however, remark: “I can’t think why this lady should make such a song about it. O’d Mme. de Cambremer got hit in the face, and she never complained.” “I will explain the difference,” replied Octave gravely, striking a match as he spoke. “It’s my belief that Mme. de Cambremer is a woman of the world, and Mme. de Villeparisis is just an upstart. Are you playing golf this afternoon?” And he left us, followed by Andrée. I was alone now with Albertine. “Do you see,” she began, “I’m wearing my hair now the way you like — look at my ringlet. They all laugh at me and nobody knows who’ I’m doing it for. My aunt will laugh at me too. But I shan’t tell her why, either.” I had a sidelong view of Albertine’s cheeks, which often appeared pale, but, seen thus, were flushed with a coursing stream of blood which lighted them up, gave them that dazzling clearness which certain winter mornings have when the stones sparkling in the sun seem blocks of pink granite and radiate joy. The joy that I was drawing at this moment from the sight of Albertine’s cheeks was equally keen, but led to another desire on my part, which was not to walk with her but to take her in my arms. I asked her if the report of her plans which I had heard were correct. “Yes,” she told me, “I shall be sleeping at your hotel to-night, and in fact as I’ve got rather a chill, I shall be going to bed before dinner. You can come and sit by my bed and watch me eat, if you like, and afterwards we’ll play at anything you choose. I should have liked you to come to the station to-morrow morning, but I’m afraid it might look rather odd, I don’t say to Andrée, who is a sensible person, but to the others who will be there; if my aunt got to know, I should never hear the last of it. But we can spend the evening together, at any rate. My aunt will know nothing about that. I must go and say good-bye to Andrée. So long, then. Come early, so that we can have a nice long time together,” she added, smiling. At these words I was swept back past the days in which I loved Gilberte to those in which love seemed to me not only an external entity but one that could be realised as a whole. Whereas the Gilberte whom I used to see in the Champs-Elysées was a different Gilberte from the one whom I found waiting inside myself when I was alone again, suddenly in the real Albertine, her whom I saw every day, whom I supposed to be stuffed with middle-class prejudices and entirely open with her aunt, there was incarnate the imaginary Albertine, she whom, when I still did not know her, I had suspected of casting furtive glances at myself on the ‘front,’ she who had worn an air of being reluctant to go indoors when she saw me making off in the other direction

    I went in to dinner with my grandmother. I felt within me a secret which she could never guess. Similarly with Albertine; to-morrow her friends would be with her, not knowing what novel experience she and I had in common; and when she kissed her niece on the brow Mme. Bontemps would never imagine that I stood between them, in that arrangement of Albertine’s hair which had for its object, concealed from all the world, to give me pleasure, me who had until then so greatly envied Mme. Bontemps because, being related to the same people as her niece, she had the same occasions to don mourning, the same family visits to pay; and now I found myself meaning more to Albertine than did the aunt herself. When she was with her aunt, it was of me that she would be thinking. What was going to happen that evening, I scarcely knew. In any event, the Grand Hotel, the evening, would no longer seem empty to me; they contained my happiness. I rang for the lift-boy to take me up to the room which Albertine had engaged, a room that looked over the valley. The slightest movements, such as that of sitting down on the bench in the lift, were satisfying, because they were in direct relation to my heart; I saw in the ropes that drew the cage upwards, in the few steps that I had still to climb, only a materialisation of the machinery, the stages of my joy. I had only two or three steps to take now along the corridor before coming to that room in which was enshrined the precious substance of that rosy form — that room which, even if there were to be done in it delicious things, would keep that air of permanence, of being, to a chance visitor who knew nothing of its history, just like any other room, which makes of inanimate things the obstinately mute witnesses, the scrupulous confidants, the inviolable depositaries of our pleasure. Those few steps from the landing to Albertine’s door, those few steps which no one now could prevent my taking, I took with delight, with prudence, as though plunged into a new and strange element, as if in going forward I had been gently displacing the liquid stream of happiness, and at the same time with a strange feeling of absolute power, and of entering at length into an inheritance which had belonged to me from all time. Then suddenly I reflected that it was wrong to be in any doubt; she had told me to come when she was in bed. It was as clear as daylight; I pranced for joy, I nearly knocked over Françoise who was standing in my way, I ran, with glowing eyes, towards my friend’s room. I found Albertine in bed. Leaving her throat bare, her white nightgown altered the proportions of her face, which, flushed by being in bed or by her cold or by dinner, seemed pinker than before; I thought of the colours which I had had, a few hours earlier, displayed beside me, on the ‘front,’ the savour of which I was now at last to taste; her cheek was crossed obliquely by one of those long, dark, curling tresses, which, to please me, she had undone altogether. She looked at me and smiled. Beyond her, through the window, the valley lay bright beneath the moon. The sight of Albertine’s bare throat, of those strangely vivid cheeks, had so intoxicated me (that is to say had placed the reality of the world for me no longer in nature, but in the torrent of my sensations which it was all I could do to keep within bounds), as to have destroyed the balance between the life, immense and indestructible, which circulated in my being, and the life of the universe, so puny in comparison. The sea, which was visible through the window as well as the valley, the swelling breasts of the first of the Maineville cliffs, the sky in which the moon had not yet climbed to the zenith, all of these seemed less than a featherweight on my eyeballs, which between their lids I could feel dilated, resisting, ready to bear very different burdens, all the mountains of the world upon their fragile surface. Their orbit no longer found even the sphere of the horizon adequate to fill it. And everything that nature could have brought me of life would have seemed wretchedly meagre, the sigh of the waves far too short a sound to express the enormous aspiration that was surging in my breast. I bent over Albertine to kiss her. Death might have struck me down in that moment; it would have seemed to me a trivial, or rather an impossible thing, for life was not outside, it was in me; I should have smiled pityingly had a philosopher then expressed the idea that some day, even some distant day, I should have to die, that the external forces of nature would survive me, the forces of that nature beneath whose godlike feet I was no more than a grain of dust; that, after me, there would still remain those rounded, swelling cliffs, that sea, that moonlight and that sky! How was that possible; how could the world last longer than myself, since it was it that was enclosed in me, in me whom it went a long way short of filling, in me, where, feeling that there was room to store so many other treasures, I flung contemptuously into a corner sky, sea and cliffs. “Stop that, or I’ll ring the bell!” cried Albertine, seeing that I was flinging myself upon her to kiss her. But I reminded myself that it was not for no purpose that a girl made a young man come to her room in secret, arranging that her aunt should not know — that boldness, moreover, rewards those who know how to seize their opportunities; in the state of exaltation in which I was, the round face of Albertine, lighted by an inner flame, like the glass bowl of a lamp, started into such prominence that, copying the rotation of a burning sphere, it seemed to me to be turning, like those faces of Michelangelo which are being swept past in the arrested headlong flight of a whirlwind. I was going to learn the fragrance, the flavour which this strange pink fruit concealed. I heard a sound, precipitous, prolonged, shrill. Albertine had pulled the bell with all her might

    * * *

    I had supposed that the love which I felt for Albertine was not based on the hope of carnal possession. And yet, when the lesson to be drawn from my experience that evening was, apparently, that such possession was impossible; when, after having had not the least doubt, that first day, on the beach, of Albertine’s being unchaste, and having then passed through various intermediate assumptions, I seemed to have quite definitely reached the conclusion that she was absolutely virtuous; when, on her return from her aunt’s, a week later, she greeted me coldly with: “I forgive you; in fact I’m sorry to have upset you, but you must never do it again,”— then, in contrast to what I had felt on learning from Bloch that one could always have all the women one liked, and as if, in place of a real girl, I had known a wax doll, it came to pass that gradually there aetached itself from her my desire to penetrate into her life, to follow her through the places in which she had spent her childhood, to be initiated by her into the athletic life; my intellectual curiosity to know what were her thoughts on this subject or that did not survive my belief that I might take her in my arms if I chose. My dreams abandoned her, once they had ceased to be nourished by the hope of a possession of which I had supposed them to be independent. Thenceforward they found themselves once more at liberty to transmit themselves, according to the attraction that I had found in her on any particular day, above all according to the chances that I seemed to detect of my being, possibly, one day, loved by her — to one or another of Albertine’s friends, and to Andrée first of all. And yet, if Albertine had not existed, perhaps I should not have had the pleasure which I began to feel more and more strongly during the days that followed in the kindness that was shewn me by Andrée. Albertine told no one of the check which I had received at her hands. She was one of those pretty girls who, from their earliest youth, by their beauty, but especially by an attraction, a charm which remains somewhat mysterious and has its source perhaps in reserves of vitality to which others less favoured by nature come to quench their thirst, have always — in their home circle, among their friends, in society — proved more attractive than other more beautiful and richer girls; she was one of those people from whom, before the age of love and ever so much more after it is reached, one asks more than they ask in return, more even than they are able to give. From her childhood Albertine had always had round her in an adoring circle four or five little girl friends, among them Andrée who was so far her superior and knew it (and perhaps this attraction which Albertine exerted quite involuntarily had been the origin, had laid the foundations of the little band). This attraction was still potent even at a great social distance, in circles quite brilliant in comparison, where if there was a pavane to be danced, they would send for Albertine rather than have it danced by another girl of better family. The consequence was that, not having a penny to her name, living a hard enough life, moreover, on the hands of M. Bontemps, who was said to be ‘on the rocks,’ and was anyhow anxious to be rid of her, she was nevertheless invited, not only to dine but to stay, by people who, in Saint-Loup’s sight, might not have had any distinction, but to Rosemonde’s mother or Andrée’s, women who though very rich themselves did not know these other and richer people, represented something quite incalculable. Thus Albertine spent a few weeks every year with the family of one of the Governors of the Bank of France, who was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of a great Railway Company. The wife of this financier entertained people of importance, and had never mentioned her ‘day’ to Andrée’s mother, who thought her wanting in politeness, but was nevertheless prodigiously interested in everything that went on in her house. Accordingly she encouraged Andrée every year to invite Albertine down to their villa, because, as she said, it was a real charity to offer a holiday by the sea to a girl who had not herself the means to travel and whose aunt did so little for her; Andrée’s mother was probably not prompted by the thought that the banker and his wife, learning that Albertine was made much of by her and her daughter, would form a high opinion of them both; still less did she hope that Albertine, good and clever as she was, would manage to get her invited, or at least to get Andrée invited, to the financier’s garden-parties. But every evening at the dinner-table, while she assumed an air of indifference slightly tinged with contempt, she was fascinated by Albertine’s accounts of everything that had happened at the big house while she was staying there, and the names of the other guests, almost all of them people whom she knew by sight or by name. True, the thought that she knew them only in this indirect fashion, that is to say did not know them at all (she called this kind of acquaintance knowing people ‘all my life’), gave Andrée’s mother a touch of melancholy while she plied Albertine with questions about them in a lofty and distant tone, speaking with closed lips, and might have left her doubtful and uneasy as to the importance of her own social position had she not been able to reassure herself, to return safely to the ‘realities of life,’ by saying to the butler: “Please tell the chef that he has not made the peas soft enough.” She then recovered her serenity. And she was quite determined that Andrée was to marry nobody but a man — of the best family, of course — rich enough for her too to be able to keep a chef and a couple of coachmen. This was the proof positive, the practical indication of ‘position.’ But the fact that Albertine had dined at the banker’s house in the country with this or that great lady, and that the said great lady had invited the girl to stay with her next winter, did not invalidate a sort of special consideration which Albertine shewed towards Andrée’s mother, which went very well with the pity, and even repulsion, excited by the tale of her misfortunes, a repulsion increased by the fact that M. Bontemps had proved a traitor to the cause (he was even, people said, vaguely Panamist) and had rallied to the Government. Not that this deterred Andrée’s mother, in her passion for abstract truth, from withering with her scorn the people who appeared to believe that Albertine was of humble origin. “What’s that you say? Why, they’re one of the best families in the country. Simonet with a single ‘n,’ you know!” Certainly, in view of the class of society in which all this went on, in which money plays so important a part, and mere charm makes people ask you out but not marry you, a ‘comfortable’ marriage did not appear to be for Albertine a practical outcome of the so distinguished patronage which she enjoyed but which would not have been held to compensate for her poverty. But even by themselves, and with no prospect of any matrimonial consequence, Albertine’s ‘successes’ in society excited the envy of certain spiteful mothers, furious at seeing her received like one of the family by the banker’s wife, even by Andrée’s mother, neither of whom they themselves really knew. They therefore went about telling common friends of those ladies and their own that both ladies would be very angry if they knew the facts, which were that Albertine repeated to each of them everything that the intimacy to which she was rashly admitted enabled her to spy out in the household of the other, a thousand little secrets which it must be infinitely unpleasant to the interested party to have made public. These envious women said this so that it might be repeated and might get Albertine into trouble with her patrons. But, as often happens, their machinations met with no success. The spite that prompted them was too apparent, and their only result was to make the women who had planned them appear rather more contemptible than before. Andrée’s mother was too firm in her opinion of Albertine to change her mind about her now. She looked upon her as a ‘poor wretch,’ but the best-natured girl living, and one who would do anything in the world to give pleasure

    If this sort of select popularity to which Albertine had attained did not seem likely to lead to any practical result, it had stamped Andrée’s friend with the distinctive marks of people who, being always sought after, have never any need to offer themselves, marks (to be found also, and for analogous reasons, at the other end of the social scale among the leaders of fashion) which consist in their not making any display of the successes they have scored, but rather keeping them to themselves. She would never say to anyone: “So-and-so is anxious to meet me,” would speak of everyone with the greatest good nature, and as if it had been she who ran after, who sought to know other people, and not they. If you spoke of a young man who, a few minutes earlier, had been, in private conversation with her, heaping the bitterest reproaches upon her because she had refused him an assignation, so far from proclaiming this in public, or betraying any resentment she would stand up for him: “He is such a nice boy!” Indeed it quite annoyed her when she attracted people, because that compelled her to disappoint them, whereas her natural instinct was always to give pleasure. So much did she enjoy giving pleasure that she had come to employ a particular kind of falsehood, found among utilitarians and men who have ‘arrived.’ Existing besides in an embryonic state in a vast number of people, this form of insincerity consists in not being able to confine the pleasure arising out of a single act of politeness to a single person. For instance, if Albertine’s aunt wished her niece to accompany her to a party which was not very lively, Albertine might have found it sufficient to extract from the incident the moral profit of having given pleasure to her aunt. But being courteously welcomed by her host and hostess, she thought it better to say to them that she had been wanting to see them for so long that she had finally seized this opportunity and begged her aunt to take her to their party. Even this was not enough: at the same party there happened to be one of Albertine’s friends who was in great distress. “I did not like the idea of your being here by yourself. I thought it might do you good to have me with you. If you would rather come away from here, go somewhere else, I am ready to do anything you like; all I want is to see you look not so sad.”— Which, as it happened, was true also. Sometimes it happened however that the fictitious object destroyed the real. Thus, Albertine, having a favour to ask on behalf of one of her friends, went on purpose to see a certain lady who could help her. But on arriving at the house of this lady — a kind and sympathetic soul — the girl, unconsciously following the principle of utilising a single action in a number of ways, felt it to be more ingratiating to appear to have come there solely on account of the pleasure she knew she would derive from seeing the lady again. The lady was deeply touched that Albertine should have taken a long journey purely out of friendship for herself. Seeing her almost overcome by emotion, Albertine began to like the lady still better. Only, there was this awkward consequence: she now felt so keenly the pleasure of friendship which she pretended to have been her motive in coming, that she was afraid of making the lady suspect the genuineness of sentiments which were actually quite sincere if she now asked her to do the favour, whatever it may have been, for her friend. The lady would think that Albertine had come for that purpose, which was true, but would conclude also that Albertine had no disinterested pleasure in seeing her, which was not. With the result that she came away without having asked the favour, like a man sometimes who has been so good to a woman, in the hope of winning her, that he refrains from declaring his passion in order to preserve for his goodness an air of nobility. In other instances it would be wrong to say that the true object was sacrificed to the subordinate and subsequently conceived idea, but the two were so far incompatible that if the person to whom Albertine endeared herself by stating the second had known of the existence of the first, his pleasure would at once have been turned into the deepest annoyance. At a much later point in this story, we shall have occasion to see this kind of incompatibility expressed in clearer terms. Let us say for the present, borrowing an example of a completely different order, that they occur very frequently in the most divergent situations that life has to offer. A husband has established his mistress in the town where he is quartered with his regiment. His wife, left by herself in Paris, and with an inkling of the truth, grows more and more miserable, and writes her husband letters embittered by jealousy. Very well; the mistress is obliged to go up to Paris for the day. The husband cannot resist her entreaties that he will go with her, and applies for short leave, which is granted. But as he is a good-natured fellow, and hates to make his wife unhappy, he goes to her and tells her, shedding a few quite genuine tears, that, driven to desperation by her letters, he has found the means of getting away from his duties to come to her, to console her in his arms. He has thus contrived by a single journey to furnish wife and mistress alike with proofs of his affection. But if the wife were to learn the reason for which he has come to Paris, her joy would doubtless be turned into grief, unless her pleasure in seeing the faithless wretch outweighed, in spite of everything, the pain that his infidelities had caused her. Among the men who have struck me as practising with most perseverance this system of what might be called killing any number of birds with one stone, must be included M. de Norpois. He would now and then agree to act as intermediary between two of his friends who had quarrelled, which led to his being called the most obliging of men. But it was not sufficient for him to appear to be doing a service to the friend who had come to him to demand it; he would represent to the other the steps which he was taking to effect a reconciliation as undertaken not at the request of the first friend but in the interest of the second, an attitude of the sincerity of which he had never any difficulty in convincing a listener already influenced by the idea that he saw before him the ‘most serviceable of men.’ In this fashion, playing in two scenes turn about, what in stage parlance is called ‘doubling’ two parts, he never allowed his influence to be in the slightest degree imperilled, and the services which he rendered constituted not an expenditure of capital but a dividend upon some part of his credit. At the same time every service, seemingly rendered twice over, correspondingly enhanced his reputation as an obliging friend, and, better still, a friend whose interventions were efficacious, one who did not draw bows at a venture, whose efforts were always justified by success, as was shewn by the gratitude of both parties. This duplicity in rendering services was — allowing for disappointments such as are the lot of every human being — an important element of M. de Norpois’s character. And often at the Ministry he would make use of my father, who was a simple soul, while making him believe that it was he, M. de Norpois, who was being useful to my father. Attracting people more easily than she wished, and having no need to proclaim her conquests abroad, Albertine kept silence with regard to the scene with myself by her bedside, which a plain girl would have wished the whole world to know. And yet of her attitude during that scene I could not arrive at any satisfactory explanation. Taking first of all the supposition that she was absolutely chaste (a supposition with which I had originally accounted for the violence with which Albertine had refused to let herself be taken in my arms and kissed, though it was by no means essential to my conception of the goodness, the fundamentally honourable character of my friend), I could not accept it without a copious revision of its terms. It ran so entirely counter to the hypothesis which I had constructed that day when I saw Albertine for the first time. Then ever so many different acts, all acts of kindness towards myself (a kindness that was caressing, at times uneasy, alarmed, jealous of my predilection for Andrée) came up on all sides to challenge the brutal gesture with which, to escape from me, she had pulled the bell. Why then had she invited me to come and spend the evening by her bedside? Why had she spoken all the time in the language of affection? What object is there in your desire to see a friend, in your fear that he is fonder of another of your friends than of you; why seek to give him pleasure, why tell him, so romantically, that the others will never know that he has spent the evening in your room, if you refuse him so simple a pleasure and if to you it is no pleasure at all? I could not believe, all the same, that Albertine’s chastity was carried to such a pitch as that, and I had begun to ask myself whether her violence might not have been due to some reason of coquetry, a disagreeable odour, for instance, which she suspected of lingering about her person, and by which she was afraid that I might be disgusted, or else of cowardice, if for instance she imagined, in her ignorance of the facts of love, that my state of nervous exhaustion was due to something contagious, communicable to her in a kiss. She was genuinely distressed by her failure to afford me pleasure, and gave me a little gold pencil-case, with that virtuous perversity which people shew who, moved by your supplications and yet not consenting to grant you what those supplications demand, are anxious all the same to bestow on you some mark of their affection; the critic, an article from whose pen would so gratify the novelist, asks him instead to dinner; the duchess does not take the snob with her to the theatre but lends him her box on an evening when she will not be using it herself. So far are those who do least for us, and might easily do nothing, driven by conscience to do something. I told Albertine that in giving me this pencil-case she was affording me great pleasure, and yet not so great as I should have felt if, on the night she had spent at the hotel, she had permitted me to embrace her. “It would have made me so happy; what possible harm could it have done you? I was simply astounded at your refusing to let me do it.” “What astounds me,” she retorted, “is that you should have thought it astounding. Funny sort of girls you must know if my behaviour surprises you.” “I am extremely sorry if I annoyed you, but even now I cannot say that I think I was in the wrong. What I feel is that all that sort of thing is of no importance, really, and I can’t understand a girl who could so easily give pleasure not consenting to do so. Let us be quite clear about it,” I went on, throwing a sop of sorts to her moral scruples, as I recalled how she and her friends had scarified the girl who went about with the actress Lea. “I don’t mean to say for a moment that a girl can behave exactly as she likes, or that there’s no such thing as immorality. Take, let me see now, yes, what you were saying the other day about a girl who is staying at Balbec and her relations with an actress; I call that degrading, so degrading that I feel sure it must all have been made up by the girl’s enemies, and that there can’t be any truth in the story. It strikes me as improbable, impossible. But to let a friend kiss you, and go farther than that even — since you say that I am your friend . . . ” “So you are, but I have had friends before now, I have known lots of young men who were every bit as friendly, I can assure you. There wasn’t one of them would ever have dared to do a thing like that. They knew they’d get their ears boxed if they tried it on. Besides, they never dreamed of trying, we would shake hands in an open, friendly sort of way, like good pals, but there was never a word said about kissing, and yet we weren’t any the less friends for that. Why, if it’s my friendship you are after, you’ve nothing to complain of; I must be jolly fond of you to forgive you. But I’m sure you don’t care two straws about me, really. Own up now, it’s Andrée you’re in love with. After all, you’re quite right; she is ever so much prettier than I am, and perfectly charming! Oh! You men!” Despite my recent disappointment, these words so frankly uttered, by giving me a great respect for Albertine, made a very pleasant impression on me. And perhaps this impression was to have serious and vexatious consequences for me later on, for it was round it that there began to form that feeling almost of brotherly intimacy, that moral core which was always to remain at the heart of my love for Albertine. A feeling of this sort may be the cause of the keenest pain. For in order really to suffer at the hands of a woman one must have believed in her completely. For the moment, that embryo of moral esteem, of friendship, was left embedded in me like a stepping-stone in a stream. It could have availed nothing, by itself, against my happiness if it had remained there without growing, in an inertia which it was to retain the following year, and still more during the final weeks of this first visit to Balbec. It dwelt in me like one of those foreign bodies which it would be wiser when all is said to expel, but which we leave where they are without disturbing them, so harmless for the present does their weakness, their isolation amid a strange environment render them

    My dreams were now once more at liberty to concentrate on one or another of Albertine’s friends, and returned first of all to Andrée, whose kindnesses might perhaps have appealed to me less strongly had I not been certain that they would come to Albertine’s ears. Undoubtedly the preference that I had long been pretending to feel for Andrée had furnished me — in the habit of conversation with her, of declaring my affection — with, so to speak, the material, prepared and ready, for a love of her which had hitherto lacked only the complement of a genuine sentiment, and this my heart being once more free was now in a position to supply. But for me really to love Andrée, she was too intellectual, too neurotic, too sickly, too much like myself. If Albertine now seemed to me to be void of substance, Andrée was filled with something which I knew only too well. I had thought, that first day, that what I saw on the beach there was the mistress of some racing cyclist, passionately athletic; and now Andrée told me that if she had taken up athletic pastimes, it was under orders from her doctor, to cure her neurasthenia, her digestive troubles, but that her happiest hours were those which she spent in translating one of George Eliot’s novels. The misunderstanding, due to an initial mistake as to what Andrée was, had not, as a matter of fact, the slightest importance. But my mistake was one of the kind which, if they allow love to be born, and are not recognised as mistakes until it has ceased to be under control, become a cause of suffering. Such mistakes — which may be quite different from mine with regard to Andrée, and even its exact opposite — are frequently due (and this was especially the case here) to our paying too much attention to the aspect, the manners of what a person is not but would like to be, in forming our first impression of that person. To the outward appearance affectation, imitation, the longing to be admired, whether by the good or by the wicked, add misleading similarities of speech and gesture. These are cynicisms and cruelties which, when put to the test, prove no more genuine than certain apparent virtues and generosities. Just as we often discover a vain miser beneath the cloak of a man famed for his bountiful charity, so her flaunting of vice leads us to suppose a Messalina a respectable girl with middle-class prejudices. I had thought to find in Andrée a healthy, primitive creature, whereas she was merely a person in search of health, as were doubtless many of those in whom she herself had thought to find it, and who were in reality no more healthy than a burly arthritic with a red face and in white flannels is necessarily a Hercules. Now there are circumstances in which it is not immaterial to our happiness that the person whom we have loved because of what appeared to be so healthy about her is in reality only one of those invalids who receive such health as they possess from others, as the planets borrow their light, as certain bodies are only conductors of electricity

    No matter, Andrée, like Rosemonde and Gisèle, indeed more than they, was, when all was said, a friend of Albertine, sharing her life, imitating her conduct, so closely that, the first day, I had not at once distinguished them one from another. Over these girls, flowering sprays of roses whose principal charm was that they outlined themselves against the sea, the same undivided partnership prevailed as at the time when I did not know them, when the appearance of no matter which of them had caused me such violent emotion by its announcement that the little band was not far off. And even now the sight of one of them filled me with a pleasure into which there entered, to an extent which I should not have found it easy to define, the thought of seeing the others follow her in due course, and even if they did not come that day, speaking about them, and knowing that they would be told that I had been on the beach

    It was no longer simply the attraction of those first days, it was a regular love-longing which hesitated among them all, so far was each the natural substitute for the others. My bitterest grief would not have been to be thrown over by whichever of the girls I liked best, but I should at once have liked best, because I should have fastened on to her the whole of the melancholy dream which had been floating vaguely among them all, her who had thrown me over. It would, moreover, in that event, be the loss of all her friends, in whose eyes I should speedily have forfeited whatever advantage I might possess, that I should, in losing her, have unconsciously regretted, having vowed to them that sort of collective love which the politician and the actor feel for the public for whose desertion of them after they have enjoyed all its favours they can never be consoled. Even those favours which I had failed to win from Albertine I would hope suddenly to receive from one or other who had parted from me in the evening with a word or glance of ambiguous meaning, thanks to which it was to her that, for the next day or so, my desire would turn. It strayed among them all the more voluptuously in that upon those volatile faces a comparative fixation of features had now begun, and had been carried far enough for the eye to distinguish — even if it were to change yet further — each malleable and floating effigy. To the differences that existed among them there was doubtless very little that corresponded in the no less marked differences in the length and breadth of those features, any of which might, perhaps, dissimilar as the girls appeared, almost have been lifted bodily from one face and imposed at random upon any other. But our knowledge of faces is not mathematical. In the first place, it does not begin with the measurement of the parts, it takes as its starting point an expression, a combination of the whole. In Andrée, for instance, the fineness of her gentle eyes seemed to go with the thinness of her nose, as slender as a mere curve which one could imagine as having been traced in order to produce along a single line the idea of delicacy divided higher up between the dual smile of her twin gaze. A line equally fine was engraved in her hair, pliant and deep as the line with which the wind furrows the sand. And in her it must have been hereditary; for the snow-white hair of Andrée’s mother was driven in the same way, forming here a swelling, there a depression, like a snowdrift that rises or sinks according to the irregularities of the soil. Certainly, when compared with the fine delineation of Andrée’s, Rosemonde’s nose seemed to present broad surfaces, like a high tower raised upon massive foundations. Albeit expression suffices to make us believe in enormous differences between things that are separated by infinitely little — albeit that infinitely little may by itself create an expression that is absolutely unique, an individuality — it was not only the infinitely little of its lines and the originality of its expression that made each of these faces appear irreducible to terms of any other. Between my friends’ faces their colouring established a separation wider still, not so much by the varied beauty of the tones with which it provided them, so contrasted that I felt when I looked at Rosemonde — flooded with a sulphurous rose colour, with the further contrast of the greenish light in her eyes — and then at Andrée — whose white cheeks received such an austere distinction from her black hair — the same kind of pleasure as if I had been looking alternately at a geranium growing by a sunlit sea and a camellia in the night; but principally because the infinitely little differences of their lines were enlarged out of all proportion, the relations between one and another surface entirely changed by this new element of colour which, in addition to being a dispenser of tints, is great at restoring, or rather at altering, dimensions. So that faces which were perhaps constructed on not dissimilar lines, according as they were lighted by the flaming torch of an auburn poll or high complexion, or by the white glimmer of a dull pallor, grew sharper or broader, became something else, like those properties used in the Russian ballet, consisting sometimes, when they are seen in the light of day, of a mere disc of paper, out of which the genius of a Bakst, according to the blood-red or moonlit effect in which he plunges his stage, makes a hard incrustation, like a turquoise on a palace well, or a swooning softness, as of a Bengal rose in an eastern garden. And so when acquiring a knowledge of faces we take careful measurements, but as painters, not as surveyors

    So it was with Albertine as with her friends. On certain days, slim, with grey cheeks, a sullen air, a violet transparency falling obliquely from her such as we notice sometimes on the sea, she seemed to be feeling the sorrows of exile. On other days her face, more sleek, caught and glued my desires to its varnished surface and prevented them from going any farther; unless I caught a sudden glimpse of her from the side, for her dull cheeks, like white wax on the surface, were visibly pink beneath, which made me anxious to kiss them, to reach that different tint which thus avoided my touch. At other times happiness bathed her cheeks with a clarity so mobile that the skin, grown fluid and vague, gave passage to a sort of stealthy and subcutaneous gaze, which made it appear to be of another colour but not of another substance than her eyes; sometimes, instinctively, when one looked at her face punctuated with tiny brown marks among which floated what were simply two larger, bluer stains, it was like looking at the egg of a goldfinch — or often like an opalescent agate cut and polished in two places only, where, from the heart of the brown stone, shone like the transparent wings of a sky-blue butterfly her eyes, those features in which the flesh becomes a mirror and gives us the illusion that it allows us, more than through the other parts of the body, to approach the soul. But most often of all she shewed more colour, and was then more animated; sometimes the only pink thing in her white face was the tip of her nose, as finely pointed as that of a mischievous kitten with which one would have liked to stop and play; sometimes her cheeks were so glossy that one’s glance slipped, as over the surface of a miniature, over their pink enamel, which was made to appear still more delicate, more private, by the enclosing though half-opened case of her black hair; or it might happen that the tint of her cheeks had deepened to the violet shade of the red cyclamen, and, at times, even, when she was flushed or feverish, with a suggestion of un-healthiness which lowered my desire to something more sensual and made her glance expressive of something more perverse and unwholesome, to the deep purple of certain roses, a red that was almost black; and each of these Albertines was different, as in every fresh appearance of the dancer whose colours, form, character, are transmuted according to the innumerably varied play of a projected limelight. It was perhaps because they were so different, the persons whom I used to contemplate in her at this period, that later on I became myself a different person, corresponding to the particular Albertine to whom my thoughts had turned; a jealous, an indifferent, a voluptuous, a melancholy, a frenzied person, created anew not merely by the accident of what memory had risen to the surface, but in proportion also to the strength of the belief that was lent to the support of one and the same memory by the varying manner in which I appreciated it. For this is the point to which we must always return, to these beliefs with which most of the time we are quite unconsciously filled, but which for all that are of more importance to our happiness than is the average person whom we see, for it is through them that we see him, it is they that impart his momentary greatness to the person seen. To be quite accurate I ought to give a different name to each of the ‘me’s’ who were to think about Albertine in time to come; I ought still more to give a different name to each of the Albertines who appeared before me, never the same, like — called by me simply and for the sake of convenience ‘the sea’— those seas that succeeded one another on the beach, in front of which, a nymph likewise, she stood apart. But above all, in the same way as, in telling a story (though to far greater purpose here), one mentions what the weather was like on such and such a day, I ought always to give its name to the belief that, on any given day on which I saw Albertine, was reigning in my soul, creating its atmosphere, the appearance of people like that of seas being dependent on those clouds, themselves barely visible, which change the colour of everything by their concentration, their mobility, their dissemination, their flight — like that cloud which Elstir had rent one evening by not introducing me to these girls, with whom he had stopped to talk, whereupon their forms, as they moved away, had suddenly increased in beauty — a cloud that had formed again a few days later when I did get to know the girls, veiling their brightness, interposing itself frequently between my eyes and them, opaque and soft, like Virgil’s Leucothea

    No doubt, all their faces had assumed quite new meanings for me since the manner in which they were to be read had been to some extent indicated to me by their talk, talk to which I could ascribe a value all the greater in that, by questioning them, I could prompt it whenever I chose, could vary it like an experimenter who seeks by corroborative proofs to establish the truth of his theory. And it is, after all, as good a way as any of solving the problem of existence to approach near enough to the things that have appeared to us from a distance to be beautiful and mysterious, to be able to satisfy ourselves that they have neither mystery nor beauty. It is one of the systems of hygiene among which we are at liberty to choose our own, a system which is perhaps not to be recommended too strongly, but it gives us a certain tranquillity with which to spend what remains of life, and also — since it enables us to regref nothing, by assuring us that we have attained to the best, and that the best was nothing out of the common — with which to resign ourselves to death

    I had now substituted, in the brains of these girls, for their supposed contempt for chastity, their memories of daily ‘incidents,’ honest principles, liable, it might be, to relaxation, but principles which had hitherto kept unscathed the children who had acquired them in their own respectable homes. And yet, when one has been mistaken from the start, even in trifling details, when an error of assumption or recollection makes one seek for the author of a malicious slander, or for the place where one has lost something, in the wrong direction, it frequently happens that one discovers one’s error only to substitute for it not the truth but a fresh error. I drew, so far as their manner of life and the proper way to behave with them went, all the possible conclusions from the word ‘Innocence’ which I had read, in talking familiarly with them, upon their faces. But perhaps I had been reading carelessly, with the inaccuracy born of a too rapid deciphering, and it was no more written there than was the name of Jules Ferry on the programme of the performance at which I had heard Berma for the first time, an omission which had not prevented me from maintaining to M. de Norpois that Jules Ferry, beyond any possibility of doubt, was a person who wrote curtain-raisers

    No matter which it might be of my friends of the little band, was not inevitably the face that I had last seen the only face that I could recall, since, of our memories with respect to a person, the mind eliminates everything that does not agree with our immediate purpose of our daily relations (especially if those relations are quickened with an element of love which, ever unsatisfied, lives always in the moment that is about to come)? That purpose allows the chain of spent days to slip away, holding on only to the very end of it, often of a quite different metal from the links that have vanished in the night, and in the journey which we make through life, counts as real only in the place in which we at any given moment are. But all those earliest impressions, already so remote, could not find, against the blunting process that assailed them day after day, any remedy in my memory; during the long hours which I spent in talking, eating, playing with these girls, I did not remember even that they were the same ruthless, sensual virgins whom I had seen, as in a fresco, file past between me and the sea

    Geographers, archaeologists may conduct us over Calypso’s island, may excavate the Palace of Minos. Only Calypso becomes then nothing more than a woman, Minos than a king with no semblance of divinity. Even the good and bad qualities which history teaches us to have been the attributes of those quite real personages, often differ widely from those which we had ascribed to the fabulous beings who bore the same names as they. Thus had there faded and vanished all the lovely mythology of Ocean which I had composed in those first days. But it is not altogether immaterial that we do succeed, at any rate now and then, in spending our time in familiar intercourse with what we have thought to be unattainable and have longed to possess. In our later dealings with people whom at first we found disagreeable there persists always, even among the artificial pleasure which we have come at length to enjoy in their society, the lingering taint of the defects which they have succeeded in hiding. But, in relations such as I was now having with Albertine and her friends, the genuine pleasure which was there at the start leaves that fragrance which no amount of skill can impart to hot-house fruits, to grapes that have not ripened in the sun. The supernatural creatures which for a little time they had been to me still introduced, even without any intention on my part, a miraculous element into the most commonplace dealings that I might have with them, or rather prevented such dealings from ever becoming commonplace at all. My desire had sought so ardently to learn the significance of the eyes which now knew and smiled to see me, but whose glances on the first day had crossed mine like rays from another universe; it had distributed so generously, so carefully, so minutely, colour and fragrance over the carnation surfaces of these girls who now, outstretched on the cliff-top, were simply offering me sandwiches or guessing riddles, that often, in the afternoon, while I lay there among them, like those painters who seek to match the grandeurs of antiquity in modern life, give to a woman cutting her toe-nail the nobility of the Spinario, or, like Rubens, make goddesses out of women whom they know, to people some mythological scene; at those lovely forms, dark and fair, so dissimilar in type, scattered around me in the grass, I would gaze without emptying them, perhaps, of all the mediocre contents with which my everyday experience had filled them, and at the same time without expressly recalling their heavenly origin, as if, like young Hercules or young Telemachus, I had been set to play amid a band of nymphs

    Then the concerts ended, the bad weather began, my friends left Balbec; not all at once, like the swallows, but all in the same week. Albertine was the first to go, abruptly, without any of her friends understanding, then or afterwards, why she had returned suddenly to Paris whither neither her work nor any amusement summoned her. “She said neither why nor wherefore, and with that she left!” muttered Françoise, who, for that matter, would have liked us to leave as well. We were, she thought, inconsiderate towards the staff, now greatly reduced in number, but retained on account of the few visitors who were still staying on, and towards the manager who was ‘just eating up money.’ It was true that the hotel, which would very soon be closed for the winter, had long since seen most of its patrons depart, but never had it been so attractive. This view was not shared by the manager; from end to end of the rooms in which we sat shivering, and and at the doors of which no page now stood on guard, he paced the corridors, wearing a new frock coat, so well tended by the hairdresser that his insipid face appeared to be made of some composition in which, for one part of flesh, there were three of cosmetics, incessantly changing his neckties. (These refinements cost less than having the place heated and keeping on the staff, just as a man who is no longer able to subscribe ten thousand francs to a charity can still parade his generosity without inconvenience to himself by tipping the boy who brings him a telegram with five.) He appeared to be inspecting the empty air, to be seeking to give, by the smartness of his personal appearance, a provisional splendour to the desolation that could now be felt in this hotel where the season had not been good, and walked like the ghost of a monarch who returns to haunt the ruins of what was once his palace. He was particularly annoyed when the little local railway company, finding the supply of passengers inadequate, discontinued its trains until the following spring. “What is lacking here,” said the manager, “is the means of commotion.” In spite of the deficit which his books shewed, he was making plans for the future on a lavish scale. And as he was, after all, capable of retaining an exact memory of fine language when it was directly applicable to the hotel-keeping industry and had the effect of enhancing its importance: “I was not adequately supported, although in the dining room I had an efficient squad,” he explained; “but the pages left something to be desired. You will see, next year, what a phalanx I shall collect.” In the meantime the suspension of the services of the B. C. B. obliged him to send for letters and occasionally to dispatch visitors in a light cart. I would often ask leave to sit by the driver, and in this way I managed to be out in all weathers, as in the winter that I had spent at Combray

    Sometimes, however, the driving rain kept my grandmother and me, the Casino being closed, in rooms almost completely deserted, as in the lowest hold of a ship when a storm is raging; and there, day by day, as in the course of a sea-voyage, a new person from among those in whose company we had spent three months without getting to know them, the chief magistrate from Caen, the leader of the Cherbourg bar, an American lady and her daughters, came up to us, started conversation, discovered some way of making the time pass less slowly, revealed some social accomplishment, taught us a new game, invited us to drink tea or to listen to music, to meet them at a certain hour, to plan together some of those diversions which contain the true secret of pleasure-giving, which is to aim not at giving pleasure but simply at helping us to pass the time of our boredom, in a word, formed with us, at the end of our stay at Balbec, ties of friendship which, in a day or two, their successive departures from the place would sever. I even made the acquaintance of the rich young man, of one of his pair of aristocratic friends and of the actress, who had reappeared for a few days; but their little society was composed now of three persons only, the other friend having returned to Paris. They asked me to come out to dinner with them at their restaurant. I think, they were just as well pleased that I did not accept. But they had given the invitation in the most friendly way imaginable, and albeit it came actually from the rich young man, since the others were only his guests, as the friend who was staying with him, the Marquis Maurice de Vaudémont, came of a very good family indeed, instinctively the actress, in asking me whether I would not come, said, to flatter my vanity: “Maurice will be so pleased.”

    And when in the hall of the hotel I met them all three together, it was M. de Vaudémont (the rich young man effacing himself) who said to me: “Won’t you give us the pleasure of dining with us?”

    On the whole I had derived very little benefit from Balbec, but this only strengthened my desire to return there. It seemed to me that I had not stayed there long enough. This was not what my friends at home were thinking, who wrote to ask whether I meant to stay there for the rest of my life. And when I saw that it was the name ‘Balbec’ which they were obliged to put on the envelope — just as my window looked out not over a landscape or a street but on to the plains of the sea, as I heard through the night its murmur to which I had before going to sleep entrusted my ship of dreams, I had the illusion that this life of promiscuity with the waves must effectively, without my knowledge, pervade me with the notion of their charm, like those lessons which one leams by heart while one is asleep

    The manager offered to reserve better rooms for me next year, but I had now become attached to mine, into which I went without ever noticing the scent of flowering grasses, while my mind, which had once found such difficulty in rising to fill its space had come now to take its measurements so exactly that I was obliged to submit it to a reverse process when I had to sleep in Paris, in my own room, the ceiling of which was low

    It was high time, indeed, to leave Balbec, for the cold and damp had become too penetrating for us to stay any longer in a hotel which had neither fireplaces in the rooms nor a central furnace. Moreover, I forgot almost immediately these last weeks of our stay. What my mind’s eye did almost invariably see when I thought of Balbec were the hours which, every morning during the fine weather, as I was going out in the afternoon with Albertine and her friends, my grandmother, following the doctor’s orders, insisted on my spending lying down, with the room darkened. The manager gave instructions that no noise was to be made on my landing, and came up himself to see that they were obeyed. Because the light outside was so strong, I kept drawn for as long as possible the big violet curtains which had adopted so hostile an attitude towards me the first evening. But as, in spite of the pins with which, so that the light should not enter, Françoise fastened them every night, pins which she alone knew how to unfasten; as in spite of the rugs, the red cretonne table-cover, the various fabrics collected here and there which she fitted in to her defensive scheme, she never succeeded in making them meet exactly, the darkness was not complete, and they allowed to spill over the carpet as it were a scarlet shower of anemone-petals, among which I could not resist the temptation to plunge my bare feet for a moment. And on the wall which faced the window and so was partially lighted, a cylinder of gold with no visible support was placed vertically and moved slowly along like the pillar of fire which went before the Hebrews in the desert. I went back to bed; obliged to taste without moving, in imagination only, and all at once, the pleasures of games, bathing, walks which the morning prompted, joy made my heart beat thunderingly like a machine set going at full speed but fixed to the ground, which can spend its energy only by turning upon its own axis

    I knew that my friends were on the ‘front,’ but I did not see them as they passed before the links of the sea’s uneven chain, far at the back of which, and nestling amid its bluish peaks like an Italian citadel, one could occasionally, in a clear moment, make out the little town of Rivebelle, drawn in minutest detail by the sun. I did not see my friends, but (while there mounted to my belvedere the shout of the newsboy, the ‘journalists’ as Françoise used to call them, the shouts of the bathers and of children at play, punctuating like the cries of sea-birds the sound of the gently breaking waves) I guessed their presence, I heard their laughter enveloped like the laughter of the Nereids in the smooth tide of sound that rose to my ears. “We looked up,” said Albertine in the evening, “to see if you were coming down. But your shutters were still closed when the concert began.” At ten o’clock, sure enough, it broke out beneath my windows. In the intervals in the blare of the instruments, if the tide were high, would begin again, slurred and continuous, the gliding surge of a wave which seemed to enfold the notes of the violin in its crystal spirals and to be spraying its foam over echoes of a submarine music. I grew impatient because no one had yet come with my things, so that I might rise and dress. Twelve o’clock struck, Françoise arrived at last. And for months on end, in this Balbec to which I had so looked forward because I imagined it only as battered by the storm and buried in fogs, the weather had been so dazzling and so unchanging that when she came to open the window I could always, without once being wrong, expect to see the same patch of sunlight folded in the corner of the outer wall, of an unalterable colour which was less moving as a sign of summer than depressing as the colour of a lifeless and composed enamel. And after Françoise had removed her pins from the mouldings of the window-frame, taken down her various cloths, and drawn back the curtains, the summer day which she disclosed seemed as dead, as immemorially ancient as would have been a sumptuously attired dynastic mummy from which our old servant had done no more than pre-cautionally unwind the linen wrappings before displaying it to my gaze, embalmed in its vesture of gold",Marcel Proust,1986,"[96, 89, 82, 53, 37, 17, 11, 10, 15, 19, 25, 30, 38, 46, 54]",15
216,If Looks Could Kill,"[Verse 1]
Something's wrong and it's not me for once
And I know you'll call me crazy
But I hate the way you look straight through me
What have I done that's so wrong?
Remember me, when I'm so far from your reach
When you'll know you had your chance
Take one more glance, and that's the end of our romance

[Chorus]
You've turned your back on me for the last time

[Verse 2]
Remember when we use to be friends?
Nothing could ever go wrong, or so we thought
But I guess you've changed a lot since we were young
Times will change, and there's nothing I can say
To right all of your wrongs
Just grow up, and pray we'll keep in touch

[Chorus]
You've turned your back on me for the last time

I still dream of the day that I watched you choke
They'll act like I'm so crazy
When they find you dead on my floor

And I pray that god saves us before we die

You can feel the punishment but you can't commit the sin
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

1. EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY
The STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over
scene, we SUPER TITLE:

NEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976

2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY
A live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the
edge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind
her.

CINDY
-- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just
agreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of
freeing the hostages.
(adjusting her hair)
We repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some
forty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers --
captive in the Statue of Liberty itself.

3. FERRYBOAT - DAY
The ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island --
has been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN,
who's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via
walkie-talkie.

SWAT CAPTAIN
Your demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their
way.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters
preparing for takeoff.

4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
The screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from
Laguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head.
A TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,
schoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand
by the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and
a fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.

RINGLEADER
Good.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and
we blow her brains out.

SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
(filter; from walkie-talkie)
Blow whose brains out?

5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
TIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the
jutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in
the whole of the statue's head.

RINGLEADER (O.S.)
(a nasty laugh)
Lady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!

6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY
MOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.

SWAT COP
Sons of bitches.

SWAT CAPTAIN
Relax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out
first.

SWAT COP II
Captain . . . what the hell is that?

All eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from
the clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head
of the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:

SWAT CAPTAIN
Shit.  Shit fire!!

SWAT COP
Sir!  What is it?

7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS
A magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,
blimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.

SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!

8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
In the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold
suited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting
inkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.

NIGHT OWL
Okay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?

He looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,
blond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:

VEIDT
(on monitor)
Let's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.

9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY
A line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a
thud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.

10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
TERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows
nothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his
walkie-talkie:

RINGLEADER
Hey.  We got a problem here --

He releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.

RINGLEADER
Come in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,
Goddammit !

11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT
The SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,
he glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic
frenzy.

SWAT COP
Ignorant bastards!  They've jammed us!

SWAT COP II
What do we do now?

SWAT CAPTAIN
We sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.

12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.
There's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he
swaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to
reveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.

Superhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather
breastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it
matches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.

13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of
the statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is
fumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone
haywire.

TERRORIST I
Base to head.  Base to head.  Come in!
(flustered)
I can't get shit!

TERRORIST II
What the hell is going on??

There's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --
just as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.

Panic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of
a long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to
his head.

TERRORIST I
I'M NOT JOKING!!

The COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED
SHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice
and he slumps to the floor, stone dead.

The TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too
stunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --

COMEDIAN
The joke's on you.

-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As
the saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.

14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor
of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --

15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to
the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL
FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.

While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point
behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS
and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the
statue's upraised TORCH.

The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the
far side of the torch.

RINGLEADER
I don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.

16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.

RORSCHACH
Got your flashgun?

CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and
goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits
behind.

17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.
He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,
then strolls over and jimmies it open.

ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.
This one's a WOMAN.

SILK SPECTRE
About time.  It stinks down there.

COMEDIAN
B-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.

As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched
wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME
underneath.

SILK SPECTRE
Why do I get all the glamour jobs?

COMEDIAN
A woman's work is never done.

18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY
The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,
CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their
guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a
TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.

RINGLEADER
I don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.

CAPT. METROPOLIS
Please.  There's something I'd like you to see first.

He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.
All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding
light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the
floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.

All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.
He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.

19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER
An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed
from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at
his throat.

COMEDIAN
Okay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?

20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
Everyone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the
TERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.

CAPT. METROPOLIS
Don't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.
(standing; to the crowd)
Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.

He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the
torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.

21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER
A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH
secures it to the tip of the torch.

22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT
SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.

SILK SPECTRE
Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .

COMEDIAN
Just barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their
balls off.

They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead
landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist
hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the
landing.

23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER
Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits
in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with
UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the
COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:

COMEDIAN
Well.  They look distracted.
(turning to face her)
Don't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?

SILK SPECTRE
Eddie -- !

Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He
turns.

One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself
over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A
SWITCH on the housing.

A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.

COMEDIAN
SHIT!

He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to
blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An
empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.

SILK SPECTRE
What about the --

COMEDIAN
FUCK 'EM!

There's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it
around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only
a second before following suit.

24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,
he FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as
well.

25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.
He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.

NIGHT OWL
Adrian!

VEIDT
Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.

NIGHT OWL
Well, good God, we can't just --

VEIDT
Mission aborted, Daniel!

NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.

26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT
On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.

27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER
The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS
throwing off sparks against the cable.

28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands
pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and
RORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off
the torch.

29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE
touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator
doors open, and the two of them dive through.

30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER
RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP
streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure
of Lady Liberty.

Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.

31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an
overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.

32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER
Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat
against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling
DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.

33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER
The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of
the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He
turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.

SWAT CAPTAIN
That's it.  I quit.

The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --

34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through
the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the
demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes
wondering what the hell happened to his date.

Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.
MANHATTAN.

Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --
are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge
blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:

COMEDIAN
ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?

In the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has
revoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police
have threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the
Watchmen are dropped.

On the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars

38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by
the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the
high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated
bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on
their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.

A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: ""NEW SKIRMISH ON
AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.""

CUSTOMER
Crazy reds don't know who they're messing with.

What happened over there?

NEWS VENDOR

39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT
A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from
the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare
with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.

PATROLMAN
STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!

We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of
reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the
city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:
his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his
plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears
a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the
back of a waiting ambulance.

DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and
buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the
investigation.

BURNS
Had a lot of blood in him.

HYDE
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.

BURNS
No idea who's behind this?

HYDE
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.

BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.

BURNS
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a
call from Washington.

HYDE
Washington?

BURNS
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.

HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after
the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.

40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a large placard: ""THE END IS NIGH.""  The bearer of the sign,
a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk
spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make
out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.

The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his
collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against
the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,
cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in
response and plugs on.

At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the
sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET
CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain
grate.

It's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its
surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to
midnight.

The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the
shattered window some forty stories above.

DISSOLVE TO:

41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted
corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading
""POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.""  At the far end is a single door,
SEALED OFF.

42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and
overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture
window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are
flapping wildly.

A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.

SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps
inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is
invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the
room.

The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,
gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The
flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS
and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.

The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains
of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky
glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for
his face.

He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and
ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should
be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.

We've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.

43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk
dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.
Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.
He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his
trenchcoat pocket.

44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,
and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.
RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive
suits.

He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on
the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.
THUMP.

He pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully
along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a
CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing
a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.

He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a
bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,
rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed
PHOTOGRAPH.

RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,
all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is
wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's
costume.

They're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.
METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH
himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we

45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner
store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with
the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated
-- old before his time.

He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough
to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.

46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
In an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in
progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in
knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG
sees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious
decision to move on.  Then --

VOICE
Hold up, papa-san!

The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and
spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they
march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,
almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we

CUT TO:

47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the
gimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place
in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.

It's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in
an alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of
fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--

-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,
transporting us back to:

48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
Real-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF
WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the
alley.

LOUDSPEAKER
HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --

The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the
LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair
some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of
the kids.

DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the
alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past
help.

49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The
security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's
apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.

DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs
it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for
the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most
peculiar sight:

DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach.

50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is
the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,
exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of
baked beans.

DREIBERG
How did you get in here?

Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,
utterly emotionless whisper:

RORSCHACH
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.

DREIBERG
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --
emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can
onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup
from a squeeze bottle.

DREIBERG (cont.)
I can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're
wanted on fourteen counts of murder.

RORSCHACH
At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.

He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it
to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his
fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Look familiar?

DREIBERG
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.

RORSCHACH
Human bean juice.
(beat)
The Comedian is dead.

DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.
His jaw goes slack.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --
beautiful view.
Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.

DREIBERG
Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?

RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.

DREIBERG (cont.)
Well, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he
must've had enemies.

RORSCHACH
So do I.  So do you.

DREIBERG
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just
paranoia.

RORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG
blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But
RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the
front door.

RORSCHACH
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with
a grudge.
(pause)
Thought you might want to spread the word.

DREIBERG
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?

RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He
opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.

RORSCHACH
You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.

He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo
from the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.

DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,
CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple
tunic and mask . . .

51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT
A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is
far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome
desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is
ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's
DREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and
pale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.

VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic
patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his
office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the
like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE
RINGS.

VEIDT
Veidt here.

52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT
DREIBERG
Adrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.
I had to call you before he --

VEIDT
Daniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?

DREIBERG
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.

VEIDT
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?

DREIBERG
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's
. . . I don't know, stalking us.

VEIDT
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.

The big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red
fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a
chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders
DREIBERG's words.

VEIDT (cont.)
Daniel, Rorschach is insane.

DREIBERG
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells
blood.

VEIDT
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs
-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.

DREIBERG
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at
this late date.

VEIDT
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected
you.  Haven't I?
(slight pause)
Do you need money?

DREIBERG
No.  I just wanted you to --

VEIDT
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good
night.

DREIBERG
Good night.

VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a
cigarette.  It's ""matchless""; you ignite it guy striking the tip of
the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a
long, slow drag.

CUT TO:

53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the
checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE
rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign
which reads ""ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.""

54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED
ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door
with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a
six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .

. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple
doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and
wait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.

The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned
woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK
SPECTRE.

LAURIE
Adrian.

VEIDT
Laurie!  Good to see you.

She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall
in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.

LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized
machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific
paraphernalia of every description.

VEIDT (cont.)
Nice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?

LAURIE
Don't rub it in.  I live here.

VEIDT
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?

LAURIE
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.

She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT
wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A
SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:

VEIDT
Hi, Jon.

DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
(a deep, booming voice)
Hello, Adrian.

DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under
any circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.
Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a
calibration atop his particle accelerator.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
I think I'm about to detect a gluino.

In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just
about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the
physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of
time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.

Any government would be glad to have him.

VEIDT
Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann
caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .

LAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.

LAURIE
Please, you guys, no shop talk.
(to DR. MANHATTAN)
Jon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?

DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable
six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist
-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:

LAURIE (cont.)
Good to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?

He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.

VEIDT
. . . Are we being monitored?

DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the
little red ""ON"" lights wink out.

DR. MANHATTAN
The bearer of bad news.

VEIDT
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.

LAURIE
Blake?  Dead?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the
funeral as a matter of protocol.

LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first
she's heard about it.

VEIDT
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to
think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen.

DR. MANHATTAN
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.

VEIDT
What's your theory?

DR. MANHATTAN
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern
me.

VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is
considerably less amused.

LAURIE
I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?

VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another
part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as
we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and
floats off to one side.

A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of
the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in
midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and
reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.

VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes
the conversation without missing a beat:

VEIDT
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.

DR. MANHATTAN
You mean Afghanistan?
(beat)
It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more
interesting.

The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The
cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws
itself shut.

VEIDT
Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as
usual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,
Jon.

DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds
his coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she
arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.

LAURIE
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --

VEIDT
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.

LAURIE
Please.

There's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his
shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing
with his superaccelerator.

VEIDT
He's a little farther gone every time.

LAURIE
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to
someone human.
(beat)
He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I
mean -- he even scares the research teams.

VEIDT
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed
the world.

LAURIE
(embarrassed)
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's
doing his work --

VEIDT
What about you?

LAURIE
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.
(pause)
I'll ring for the guards.

She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,
concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest
pocket for a cigarette case:

VEIDT
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.
(handing her a cigarette)
Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give
Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.

LAURIE
Maybe I'll do that.

VEIDT
I'm sorry about Blake.

He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS
appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.

LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman
lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and
WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.

CUT TO:

55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,
popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow
stairway which dips well below street level.

56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT
The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS
hover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS
stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and
grind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.

Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE
off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of
vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the
bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing
glasses.

RORSCHACH
Harry.

HARRY
(petrified)
R-Rorschach.

RORSCHACH
Phone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?

He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH
picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS
and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.

He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:

RORSCHACH
Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had
help.
(wandering through the room)
Thought maybe you could fill me in.

ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as
RORSCHACH strolls past.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?
(moving on)
Johnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?

Behind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively
toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,
yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?

NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH
extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --

-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He
closes a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and
SNAPS IT.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Edward Blake.  Who killed him?

No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH
grabs his index finger and repeats the process.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Who killed Edward Blake?

NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to
the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let
fly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.

VOICE
JESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!

RORSCHACH
THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?

By now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.
Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It
catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of
glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the
ceiling.

SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He
looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
So many vermin . . . so little time.

He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it
contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long
enough to HISS at the crowd:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be
around.


CUT TO:

57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN
The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller
research complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and
LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over
to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is
empty.

LAURIE
(muttering; groggy)
Jon . . . ?

A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE
closes her eyes and sighs.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm here, Laurie.

LAURIE
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?

DR. MANHATTAN
Not yet, there's plenty of time.

A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.
DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.

LAURIE
Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?

The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,
toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.

DR. MANHATTAN
Would you like me to stay?

LAURIE
Mm hmm.

DR. MANHATTAN
I could stay and go.

LAURIE
. . . And just how would you manage that?

She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its
downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is
massaging LAURIE's thigh.

Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly
wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.

DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the
foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.

LAURIE
AAAAAAAAAA!!

DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie?  Are you --

DR. MANHATTAN II
Don't be upset.

This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's
fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a
dressing gown.

LAURIE
Jon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one
person again, please?

The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical
gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.

DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --

DR. MANHATTAN II
-- you would find it erotic.

LAURIE
All right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy
in this place, I --

While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance
through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,
she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an
experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through
the door . . .

58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER
. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:

LAURIE
You've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your
stupid experiments --

DR. MANHATTAN III
Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.

LAURIE
So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how
could you do this?

DR. MANHATTAN III
You seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?
(pause)
I thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.

LAURIE
That's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you
can --

She doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered
the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:

DR. MANHATTANS I & II
Laurie, please --

LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back
slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.

LAURIE
Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I
could really use the time alone.

She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &
II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original
DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his
equipment.

FADE THROUGH TO:

1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard
at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly
beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely
wasted on her preoccupied date.

At the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:

LAURIE
The government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I
guess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.
(mock-macho)
I have to keep him in line.

She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to
laugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has
wandered off into a far corner of the room.

LAURIE (cont.)
Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?

DREIBERG
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think
anyone's out to get us -- do you?

LAURIE
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no
Mother Teresa.

DREIBERG
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .

LAURIE
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the
government or do time.

DREIBERG
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty
tricks -- political assassinations --

Now he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then
leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:

LAURIE
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us
made other choices.

DREIBERG
(shaking his head in disgust)

Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors
. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.

LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.

DREIBERG (cont.)
What's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?

LAURIE
I'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could
see yourself right now.
(raising her glass)
Well, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .
and we're not.

DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.

1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,
which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters
of brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.

DREIBERG
The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I
mean, we were heroes!

LAURIE
Damn straight.

DREIBERG
Damn straight!  We were heroes.

LAURIE
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.

DREIBERG
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the
world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .

LAURIE
(smiling)
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?
What was his name . . .

DREIBERG
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd
beat him up?

LAURIE
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?

DREIBERG
(deadpan)
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an
elevator shaft.

LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to
her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA
PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a
stentorian VOICE over scene:

CHAPLAIN (V.O.)
In the midst of life we are in death . . .

CUT TO:

59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY
AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.

CHAPLAIN
. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall
change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --

TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of
mourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the
attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons
of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off
with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.

CHAPLAIN (cont.)
-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all
things unto himself.

A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.
MANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish
miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the
distance, and he glances off at:

60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT
SENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the
cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has
been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like
wildfire.

MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the
cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due
respect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:
gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their
hands full managing the crowd.

A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to
join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the
VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.

It's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled
marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,
and he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,
Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze
plaque bears the inscription:

IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS
WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES
TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM

Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four
hundred of them.

61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet
home.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her
through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind
her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.

62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT
LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,
fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the
card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.

She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls
up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps
out.

LAURIE
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.

ADAMSON
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.

LAURIE
Why?  What's the problem?

ADAMSON
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.

LAURIE
(chuckling)
I would like to use the bathroom --

As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.

ADAMSON
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.

LAURIE
What?!

ADAMSON
Please.

The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The
GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.

ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she
sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.

The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging
from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION
SUITS.

63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to
a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard
at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white
gown:

NURSE
Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.

LAURIE
What -- ?

DOCTOR
Drink this.

The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She
stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.

DOCTOR
Drink it.

64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT
TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are
shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of
a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens
on:

65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
We're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A
donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,
foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to
the anteroom.

Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head
wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right
as she wonders just what the hell is going on.

66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
A MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.

LAURIE (O.S.)
That's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.

LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table
surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent
SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken
from a thick sheaf.

LAURIE (cont.)
Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The
quantum-whatever.

SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the
Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE
hesitates.

LAURIE (cont.)
That's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.
(long pause)
Rorschach . . .

SCHMIDT
Their real names, please.

LAURIE
I don't know their real names.

SCHMIDT
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.

LAURIE
I don't know their real names!

SCHMIDT
You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on
the answers you give.
(holding up the sheaf of photos)
These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --

LAURIE
Then why don't you ask him?!?

Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby
window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced
torturers, they understand the value of patience.

LAURIE (cont.)
I want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.

One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out
for LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door
opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.

He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and
tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with
curiosity:

LAURIE (cont.)
Someone had better tell me what's going on here!

SCHMIDT
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file
are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else
in common as well.
(beat)
They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.

LAURIE
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?

All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes
bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she
takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.

SCHMIDT
I'm terribly sorry.

LAURIE
What does this mean?  What does it --

SCHMIDT
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can
see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.

LAURIE
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible
joke to make me --

She scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to
his comrades, and heads for the door.

SCHMIDT
Take a day or two.  If you ""remember"" any names . . . do give us a
call.

The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches
for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,
she buries her face in her hands.

67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a
two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been
watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.

ADAMSON
Poor kid.

SCHMIDT
We'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.

ADAMSON
To hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc
Manhattan.

SCHMIDT
What do you mean?

ADAMSON
She's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows
which way he'll jump.

DISSOLVE TO:

68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY
DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing
a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie
with an irregular mauve pattern.

The tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie
magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal
gold stripes.

Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into
a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for
decoration.

It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the
mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.

69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY
TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green
room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.

DIRECTOR
We're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is
that big blue son of a --

He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just
rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's
face.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Am I late?

DIRECTOR
No problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm
Kent Turner, the director. . .

The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a
hallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.

LIAISON
Dr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to
steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll
just play it cool --

DIRECTOR
Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give
us something a little darker . . . ?

DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.

DR. MANHATTAN
Will this do?

DIRECTOR
Perfect.

LIAISON
Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --

But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by
a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are
hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON
hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The ""ABC NEWS
SPECIAL REPORT"" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC
underneath.

70. INSERT - TV MONITOR
Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for
their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right
and takes in an extraordinary sight.

A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through
the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the
greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts
of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation
crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:
""VIETNAM.  1965.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific
mishap.  For more than twenty years the ""Manhattan Option"" has been
the linchpin of America's conventional strategy --

We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad
thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds
a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.

His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey
gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM
hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met
with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:
""CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a
one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding
the Communist menace in check.

DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from
American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake
hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a
three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic
accord.  Title: ""NICARAGUA.  1979.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, ""Yes, Virginia,
there is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.""

71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop
of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded
news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:

BRINKLEY
For this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by
correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,
I'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.
(turning)
Now let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better
known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.

Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at
BRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.

BRINKLEY (cont.)
I suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,
where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now
since you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .
. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that
you intervene?

DR. MANHATTAN
I will not intervene in Afghanistan.

A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.

72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.

73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.
BRINKLEY ignores them:

BRINKLEY
You're saying you would refuse a direct request?

DR. MANHATTAN
There will be no request.  I will not intervene.

BRINKLEY
Well, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can
actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the
hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?

74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
He's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on
DR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE
in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:

LIAISON
I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.

75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
DR. MANHATTAN
I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.
(long pause)
I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will
not intervene.

He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.

BRINKLEY
Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll
open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?

REPORTER
Dr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read
you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.
Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?

DR. MANHATTAN
All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.

ROTH
Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.
Are you aware that these ""friends"" and ""associates"" of yours have all
been diagnosed with terminal cancer?

The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He
gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face
an unreadable mask.

76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone

LIAISON
Oh Jesus.
(barking into phone)
I want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I
have to!

77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN
ROTH
I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly
diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a
connection?

By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make
himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message
from the booth, touches his headset and announces:

BRINKLEY
I'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief
message --

Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,
flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.

LIAISON
THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!

The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,
PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB
THE SET.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause
cancer??

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't wish to answer any questions.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
You see the future!  Did you know in advance --

LIAISON
The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP
ASIDE!!

The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but
the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this
information --

DR. MANHATTAN
Please get out of my way.

The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.
SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN
lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:

DR. MANHATTAN
I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!

In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no
microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.
MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.

BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,
there's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,
leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.

CUT TO:

78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is
overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post
quarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised
when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.

DR. MANHATTAN
Where's Laurie?

ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and
he's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely
necessary.

ADAMSON
She's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .

DR. MANHATTAN
There's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the
results positive?

ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Don't bother.  I already know what you'll say.

He watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His
mind is already a million miles away.

ADAMSON
Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .
could you cure her?

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know.  I only know that I won't.
(long pause)
There'd be no point.  It's finally begun.

ADAMSON
""Begun?""  What's begun?

DR. MANHATTAN
I've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.
(pause)
You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I
cared for . . .

ADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down
his spine nonetheless.

DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.

And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves
behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at
the Major's feet.

ADAMSON
Good Lord --

CUT TO:

79. EXT. OUTER SPACE
-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few
hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily
apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily
beautiful
-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white
clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing
our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.

It's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on
nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.
Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to
leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.

80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT
Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so
barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,
until we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined
quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,
half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than
husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a
rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.

A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden
RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue
light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift
in the sky and descends gently to earth.

The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once
more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town
of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was
once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long
mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.

A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We
MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and

DISSOLVE TO:

81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY
It's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN
-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie
and a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing
a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:

JANEY SLATER (O.S.)
Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they
could at least make us a decent hamburger.

JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten
with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple
of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just
close enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's
probably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush
JON has on her.

JON
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna
head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.

JANEY
With lots of ketchup?

Smiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a
bottle on his french fries.

JON
Nothing wrong with ketchup.

JANEY
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug
like you doing in a place like this?

JON
Anything for science, I guess.
(long, hesitant pause)
Janey, there's something --

JANEY
(simultaneously)
We should get back --
(realizing she's cut him off)
What?

JON
Nothing.  What were you going to say?

JANEY
We should get back to the lab.
(staring at him; chuckling)
You okay, Jon?

He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he
pipes up:

JON
Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.

The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads
for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after
JANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.

His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up
behind her.

JANEY
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --

JON
(blurting it out)
Janey, will you marry me?

She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the
pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the
verdict.

JANEY
Jon -- what?

JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes
locked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the
canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the
door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and
one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled
JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.

There's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private
trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.

WALLY
Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.

JANEY
Oh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --

JON
I can fix it.

JANEY
-- What?

JON
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better
than ever.

He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.

WALLY
Take him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.

Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY
hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her
with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his
answer.

But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.
He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --

JON
Here.  I'll trade you.

-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.
With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but
he's already gone.

She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.

82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY
JON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center
of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S
TOOLS.

It's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the
central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal
into its housing and gives it a light tap.

With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,
remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed
with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST
CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of
it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like
anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.

He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and
walks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK
from the direction of the test chamber.

Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,
seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON
eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to
the reinforced steel door of the chamber.

Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a
low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it
hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the
concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.

JON
C'mon, little guy, outta here . . .

The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in
hand.

JON (cont.)
. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.

He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch
inside.

He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.
Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the
doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of
the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete
block, reaches for the watch --

-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.

White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete
block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of
the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.

Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --
TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.

He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps
sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams
shut.

83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT
1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One
of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of
MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the
facilities.

SCIENTIST
-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the
intrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few
concrete blocks all to hell.

GENERAL
(joking, but worried)
No danger of . . . fallout, is there?

SCIENTIST
No sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why
we waited outside.

The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a
dull red.

The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant
THUMPING.

The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect
unison.

GENERAL
What's the matter?

SCIENTIST
Sweet Jesus -- !

We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of
the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the
terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,
screaming soundlessly.

Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,
punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes
to a belated and painfully obvious realization:

GENERAL
Say, there's a man in there!!

The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One
SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --

SCIENTIST I
Stay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!

-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:

SCIENTIST II
Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.
chamber!!

The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.

GENERAL
Well -- why doesn't someone let him out??

SCIENTIST III
It's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence
starts.
(to SCIENTIST II)
What's the word?

SCIENTIST II
(covering the phone)
They're sending a crew to the generator building --

SCIENTIST IV
TWENTY SECONDS!

In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions ""IN
CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.""  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the
canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the
glass, and grabs the ax.

SCIENTIST I
Wally!  What are you doing?

WALLY
The power cables!!

And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY
SLATER.

JANEY
Am I late for the --

She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the
lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back
through the door.

SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!

But she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to
take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils
have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.

JANEY
What in the name of -- where's Jon?

SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Please!  Go!!

WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a
sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a
wall.

Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white
light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look
at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.

JANEY
Jon.

84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his
face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,
which he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .
. .

. . . and everything in the room goes blue.

85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT
The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to
tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind
them.

JANEY
Jon . . .
(shrieking)
JON!!!

86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of
unbelievable agony.

A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a
photographic negative -- stands in his place.

Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The
iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to
pieces.

And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,
and we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of
the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,
who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.

DISSOLVE TO:

87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall
behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago
at 11:48 PM.

For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches
the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the
door of the canteen.

88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.

89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into
the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous
thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal
cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous
system.

They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in
a haze of shimmering blue light.

90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.

91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A
partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS
for several seconds before vanishing altogether.

92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.

93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.

JANEY
I can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it
feels haunted.

WALLY
It'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.
(tugging at his ear)
Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?

Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.
Odder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.
Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish
phenomenon.

UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without
warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW
suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .

. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,
nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and
utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.

JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go
to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.

JANEY
JON-N-N-N!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,
stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and
begins to dig.

A couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,
tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and
Janey Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new
engagement ring.

His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.

95. SERIES OF SHOTS
Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:

-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;

-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue
light;

-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.
There's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a
terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .

-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom
cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.

96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN
Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in
the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at
first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue
starburst a mile above the ground.

97. EXT. OUTER SPACE
All at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth
at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on
toward Mars.

The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame
as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.
Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:
vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.
Herschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre
planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling
two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular
ridge.

Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a
happy-face.

Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian
atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we

The late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference.
As the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on
his angered face:

DR. MANHATTAN
I said leave me alone!!

Then there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same
positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on
the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.

PULL BACK TO:

99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT
A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.
She's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the
big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy
furnished studio.

TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)
-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported
a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania
Avenue!

TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
Well, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --

LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,
SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.

SCHMIDT
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.

LAURIE
Am I free to go?

SCHMIDT
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move
it.

LAURIE
(fed up; exploding)
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit
--

SCHMIDT
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan
border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living
soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic
weapons has finally flipped out.

LAURIE
Jon??  You mean he's --

SCHMIDT
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard
has apparently left the planet.

100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY
The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:

DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH
Russian Tanks Advance
President Vows ""Maximum Force""
WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?

And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS
VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:

NEWS VENDOR
I'll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks,
bombs, ICBM's!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a
bitch --

CUSTOMER
Anyone ever tell you you're full of shit?

NEWS VENDOR
Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!

VOICE
New Frontiersman, please.

The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old
friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign.
He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under
the counter.

NEWS VENDOR
Here you go, pal.  Two bucks.
(beat)
Well, I see the world ain't ended yet.

The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  ""EXPOSED: RED

STREET CRAZY

101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A
DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight
WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and
off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging
tipsy giggles.

102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT
A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN
ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;
his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --
we'll call him MOLOCH.

MOLOCH
Now.  What was milady drinking?

LUCY
Gin.  Straight up --
(mock-ladylike)

-- with a little twist of lime.

She laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest
joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:

MOLOCH
I think I can oblige.

103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The
contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen
floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a
disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in
the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.

LUCY
Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?

On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.
He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen
table.

RORSCHACH
Moloch.  Did you miss me?

LUCY
Willie!  Jesus!  What's going on?

RORSCHACH
(glancing up)
Who's the welfare mother?

MOLOCH
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong
guy.

RORSCHACH
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.

MOLOCH
You're making a big --

RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against
the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.

RORSCHACH
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.

MOLOCH
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?

LUCY
Willie, what's he talking about?

RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.
RORSCHACH kneels beside him.

MOLOCH
Look, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for
ten years.  I --

RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him
close.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:

RORSCHACH
Turned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.
(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)
Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.

He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar
bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as
MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's
behind it?

MOLOCH
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with
--

RORSCHACH
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.

MOLOCH
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --

RORSCHACH
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.

LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as
RORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when
he stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Word of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.

-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously
at MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking
about.

104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY
The familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a
big round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world
looming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a
MILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight
POINTER,
highlighting areas of strategic importance.

ANALYST
Our projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there
it's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.

GENERAL
Respectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're
quizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.

MOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which
bears the seal of the President of the United States.

PRESIDENT
First strike.
(long pause)
I'd like to view the simulation.

The ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.

ANALYST
Optimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of
their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.

On the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the
Pacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf --
blossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION
SYMBOLS as they strike their targets.

PRESIDENT
What about our end?

ANALYST
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that
twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.

On the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.

ANALYST (cont.)
Britain down -- Germany down --

PRESIDENT
What kind of time frame are we talking about?

ANALYST
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified
command bunker at the time of the launch order.

RADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington,
Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

PRESIDENT
. . . Of course.

By now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a
dedicated optimist, turns to announce:

ANALYST
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the
farm belt.

PRESIDENT
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter""
theory?

ANALYST
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .
may depend on a quirk of the weather.

PRESIDENT
The weather.  I see.
(pause)
Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum
strike conditions.

The SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:

SECRETARY LIDDY
Dick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan
may decide to return.

With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the
table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined
and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than
that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at
74.

PRESIDENT (cont.)
Good God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of
retirement.

A private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an
examination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the
doorway.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.

LAURIE
Not at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.

106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK
A greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near
the entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken
tandoori.

DREIBERG
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a
couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .
(pause)
How about you, Laurie?

LAURIE
(lying -- with forced cheer)
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the
hell out.
(shrugging)
No expense account.  No place to live.

DREIBERG
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each
other, someone might put two and two together . . .

LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.

LAURIE
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're
right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the
Watchmen.

DREIBERG
Maybe not, but why take chances?

LAURIE
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent
all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --
I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own
life, and --

-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a
damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts
to get up.

LAURIE
I'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find
myself a cheap room.

DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the
door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and
chases her down:

DREIBERG
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .
.
LAURIE
Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --

DREIBERG
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely
right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

LAURIE
You're sure?

He nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the
restaurant.

THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the
street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of
frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of
ketchup.

He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down
question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he
opens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.

107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET
A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,
then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls
casually down the alleyway.

He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the
crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a
small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a
shifting INKBLOT MASK.

108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:
flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.
It's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative ""aah"" as
DREIBERG ushers her in.

LAURIE
This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.

DREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands
there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.

LAURIE (cont.)
Are you . . . waiting for a tip?

DREIBERG
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I
mean, if you need some aspirin, or --

LAURIE
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really
sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?

She gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her
unpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.

As he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE
unbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door
shut.

DREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds
his hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.

111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --
LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off
valiantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.

An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into
frame; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP
overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and
snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.

Early morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in
an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and
crewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.

MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA
DINER.

114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and
pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the
nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges
of his EYELIDS.

His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;
bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it
up . . .

There's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.

A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and
sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.

He GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and
holds the stall door shut.

RORSCHACH
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational
drugs.

MOLOCH
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got
something for you.

A long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.

MOLOCH (cont.)
There's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on
a case, trying to track 'em down.

It's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all
I've been able to find out.

RORSCHACH
Drug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.

Let it go time.  In future -- just say no.

With that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits
there a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't
open.

MOLOCH
HEY!!

RORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the
adjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we

process of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure
who's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.

JUSTINE
Now Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.
Are you the world's smartest man?

VEIDT
Oh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.

A round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!

JUSTINE
You're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty
basic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday
lives.

If you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?

VEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls
out his gold cigarette case.

VEIDT
Sphinx brand.

When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .
humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good
in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,
that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs
as you smoke it?

In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?

JUSTINE
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your
old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --

JUSTINE
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.

VEIDT
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --

VEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.
He glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.

VEIDT (cont.)
-- we agreed specifically --

MORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting
curious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.

VEIDT (cont.)
Excuse me a second.

He goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley
JUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.

116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY
VEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with
his mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:

One last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --
no visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his
dignity.

VEIDT (cont.)
How the hell did you get in here?

The curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He
looks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass
window.

RORSCHACH
New information.

VEIDT

Ever see one of these before?

RORSCHACH
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked
up.

VEIDT
What is that ungodly smell?

RORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark
HISS.

RORSCHACH
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .

VEIDT
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a
roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.

And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us
all look bad.

LAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full
glass of wine and thrusts it at him.

LAURIE
Daniel -- drink this.  Immediately.
(smiling)
I swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.

Sucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.

DREIBERG
Okay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think
of you as Dr. Manhattan's --

He catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.

LAURIE
His what?

DREIBERG
His . . . whatever.

LAURIE
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?

She spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward

dismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.

DREIBERG
Good Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball
game.

LAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much
interest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo
cabinet.

LAURIE
That's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.
(smiling)
God!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.

She's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it
are row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's
items.

DREIBERG
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I
listen to -- it never came out on crystal.

LAURIE
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.

Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these

LAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar
COMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and
gazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.

Oh look.  It's Adrian's ad.

No reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,

around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,
the WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her

He creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.

121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH
staring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND
BULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and
spins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --

TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
For the smooth young face he'll never forget --

122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the
TV ad.

TV ANNOUNCER
-- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.

DREIBERG
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?

LAURIE
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm
thirty-eight years old!

DREIBERG
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide
it?

LAURIE
I like the way you look.
(beat)
It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.
But you, Daniel, you look . . .

DREIBERG
Old?

LAURIE
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.
(standing up)
Here, you pick one.

DREIBERG
. . . What?

LAURIE
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.

Her tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,
with a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.

123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:

LOUDSPEAKER
RORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO
COME OUT.

He goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street
outside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A
CTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.

LOUDSPEAKER
YOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!

He's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES
-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.

124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller
tune, ""S'posin'.""  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces
illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile
she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt
pocket.

Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making
him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her
hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so
that he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on
his mouth.

The PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:

""S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .
Do you think that you could love me too . . .""

125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
SONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a
horrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying
a plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --
ordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around
under the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,
rubbing alcohol, Drano.

Almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the
burners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.

""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .
Would it impress you . . .""

126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
A contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.

""Or would it distress you?  Hmm?""

127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and
rubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --
resting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the
front door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the
hallway just outside the living room.

The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH
strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --
creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the
puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF
BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.

""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .""

128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in
disarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,
unable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going
well.

""S'posin' I declare it
Would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .""

He wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her
breast.

129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through
the kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.

He empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he
ducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.

130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
RORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper
into its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from
the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov
cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.

The COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit
the floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.

RORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is
coming up with back way behind him.

131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
Charred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.

132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
A GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE
hails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:

""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . .
Would it impress you? . . .""

133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it
anymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and
sits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she
doesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,
embracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.

"". . . Or would it distress you?""

134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.
By now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU
COPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.

He still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for
his last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,
where it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.

""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .""

The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He
steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their
weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.

The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as
RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.

135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
RORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the
face.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a
blimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN
FIRE peppers the roof.

""S'posin' I declare it.
Would you take my love and share it? . . .""

RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE
ESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front
of the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on
the street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and
tries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed
AIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.

""I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.""

The song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL
OF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street
below.

136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
Three stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and
lies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on
him instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle
butts.

COPS
GET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!

RORSCHACH
GNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!

In seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face
topped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar
face . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand
with his placards announcing the end of the world.

COP
Christ.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears
elevator shoes!

RORSCHACH
NO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!

He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off
to a nearby van.

COP II
So that's the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.

RORSCHACH
GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!

The van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS
arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.

CUT TO:

137. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He
stares up at the ceiling, still troubled.

DREIBERG
I'm sorry, Laurie.  I --

LAURIE
It's all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold
me.

For a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His
gaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.

LAURIE
Daniel.  What --

On the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL
reaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.

TV ANCHOR
. . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked
vigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent
confrontation at a downtown tenement . . .

The news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.

LAURIE
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.

DREIBERG
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get
to trial.

Now the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and
the acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.

TV ANCHOR
. . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a
history of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described
Kovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:

LANDLORD (ON TV)
All kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that
place when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --

LAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low
whistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to
pace the room.

LAURIE
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.
(beat)
I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel?
What's wrong?

DREIBERG
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.

He stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?

138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING
The familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID
-- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement
nearby, reading a comic book.

The NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic
little number entitled ""COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.""

NEWS VENDOR
Hey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for
that.

KID
No way.  This one sucks.

A CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the
newsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.

DR. LONG
Gazette, please.

The NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover
bears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS,
with the banner headline: ""CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER.""

NEWS VENDOR
'Dyou see this?  This guy's a customer of mine!
(shaking his head)
I mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You
never know.

LONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he
wanders off down the street.

139. STUDY - NIGHT
DR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk
with a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of
RORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the
NYPD:

NAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph
ADDRESS: Transient
BORN: 3/21/43
MOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick)
FATHER'S NAME: Unknown

By now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA,
wanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When
she rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his
seat.

DR. LONG
Oh!  Sorry.  I didn't hear you.

SYLVIA
How much longer?
(staring down at the desk)
It's that vigilante, isn't it.  That --

DR. LONG
Rorschach
(correcting himself)
Kovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten.
We pulled his record from the juvenile home --

Without looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA's
direction.

DR. LONG (cont.)
No father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child
abuse . . .
(swiveling to face her)
Classic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes,
these ""Watchmen"" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out
just what makes them do it.

SYLVIA
Malcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.

SYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS
FIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair.
They're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and
crotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title ""MY
DREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.""

It's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a
shiver.

SYLVIA (cont.)
Why don't you come to bed?

DR. LONG
(totally engrossed)
I'd like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive
material.
(grabbing a transcript)

Mother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one
word of comment: ""Good.""

SYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly,
and gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG
goes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.

DR. LONG (cont.)
Still, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an
extraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him.
(nodding his head)
I can reach him.

CUT TO:

140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
A bare, windowless chamber, 10' by 10'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in
folding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor
reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.

DR. LONG
Now, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look
at each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All
right?

RORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up
the first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.

RORSCHACH
Butterfly.

LONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Some nice flowers.

LONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third
card.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
A doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.

He shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of
frustration.

DR. LONG
Walter --

RORSCHACH
Don't call me that.

DR. LONG
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to
hear.

RORSCHACH
Wrong answers?

DR. LONG
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest
response, I can't help you.
(pause)
I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.

RORSCHACH
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.

LONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this.
He shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under
the table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.

DR. LONG
Well, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide
to cooperate.

TWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to
leave.  He pauses in the doorway.

RORSCHACH
Doctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what
makes me sick.
(beat)
You'll find out.  -- You'll find out.

CUT TO:

141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY
A huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns,
fountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden.
JUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the
central escalator and swing into action.

JUSTINE
Adrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?

He's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and
secretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the
cameras.

VEIDT
No comment.

JUSTINE
Did you know he was back on the streets?

VEIDT
I did not.  Now get out of my way!

JUSTINE
Isn't it true that you --

He keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he
STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a
pillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.

ASSASSIN
VEIDT!

VEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and
comes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's
agility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY
in his hands.

He swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a
FOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.

As the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and
slams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King
Tut.

VEIDT
Son of a bitch.  Who sent you?

Arms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's
hair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.

SECURITY GUARD
Stand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!

VEIDT
He's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you
scum, I want to know who sent you!

The ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down
into the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.

VEIDT
Goddammit . . .

SECURITY GUARD
Who'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?

VEIDT
I don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.

142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK
TIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.

NEWSCASTER
-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating
fears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside
St. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from
morning Mass --

A PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,
reaches for the receiver.

DREIBERG
Yeah.
(beat)
Adrian!  What's up?

143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG
VEIDT
In have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it
on the news.
(beat)
Someone tried to kill me today.

For a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether
surprised.

DREIBERG
Who?

VEIDT
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm
starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?

DREIBERG
She's with me.

VEIDT
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.
(beat)
Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until
all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.

DREIBERG
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.

He hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.
LAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off
her hair.

LAURIE
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?

DREIBERG
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.
(beat)
. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.

He doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks
up on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away
from him and steadies herself against a bureau.

DREIBERG
-- What is it.

LAURIE
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't
around.

DREIBERG
Laurie --

LAURIE
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --

DREIBERG
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.

His sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,
fed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over
behind her.

LAURIE
I shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told
you --

But before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from
behind.

DREIBERG
Laurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than
anything else in the world.

CUT TO:

144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
CONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving
area.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward
the dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby
tables:

VOICE
Hey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --

VOICE II
Rorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --

Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH
picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The
smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.

GOON I
Didn't know he was such a tiny little thing.

GOON II
Little?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.

RORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A
SERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.

GOON III
I'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .
.

GOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.

GOON III (cont.)
Notched up some big names over the years.

Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of
his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III
follows.

The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving
counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings
a KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and
tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,
into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.

Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH
uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON
II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby
burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with
HOT COOKING FAT.

All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two
disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked
and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in
with billy clubs drawn.

As the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It
sounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.

CUT TO:

145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT
A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --
delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of
the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are
totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal
doors.

At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,
then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of
RORSCHACH.

TRUSTY
Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'
man.
(beat)
Their friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .
this whole place blows.

RORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The
TRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.

TRUSTY (cont.)
I'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --

RORSCHACH
I'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.

With that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.

CUT TO:

146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a
square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED
WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.

Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across
the table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of
inkblots as before, the ""butterfly"" leading off.  But this time, the
subject has decided to cooperate:

RORSCHACH
A whore fucking.

DR. LONG
Who is she?  Do you know her?

Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the ""nice
flowers"":

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Man's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.

LONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Doggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --
(pause; then, smiling)
-- with his skull split open.

DR. LONG
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?

RORSCHACH
Why, doctor.  I did.
(beat)
He was a bad dog.

RORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass
tacks.

DR. LONG
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In
your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?

RORSCHACH
God isn't there to do it.

DR. LONG
We don't know that.

RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.

DR. LONG
So the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?
(no response)
You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why
would you want to kill a dog?

With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:

RORSCHACH
One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.

147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
Ruined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for
the distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues
OVER SCENE:

RORSCHACH (V.O.)
'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no
word.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to
intervene.

The lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up
his collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a
ramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.

He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO
HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen
object.

148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,
flicks on a flashlight.

Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The
light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders
over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and
on the floor, a ROPE.

There's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,
sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a
charred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with
balloons and teddy bears.

He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden
CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding
paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's
knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh
WINDOW.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Dogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had
gone.

149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
The German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the
dogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB
OF BONE.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Decided to wait for the owner . . .

150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Keys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN
enters and whistles to the dogs.

FAT MAN
Fred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--

RORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.

151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the
story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his
reply, asks:

DR. LONG
Then what happened?

RORSCHACH
. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had
to break in.

152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's
handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a
GROCERY SACK.

He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off
his glove and reaches into the sack.

FAT MAN
What -- what are you d--

RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER
into his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he
spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,
throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's
done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER
BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.

FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,
and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs
inside.

Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.

153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things
up.

RORSCHACH
When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their
skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.
(leaning forward)
See, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed
her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,
he did't seem to mind.

DR. LONG
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --

RORSCHACH
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make
it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.
(slight smile)
What else can I illuminate?

LONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the
PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he
points a finger at LONG's inkblot.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .
just a man's face.
(pause)
See it now?

The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a
couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a
second he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he
STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern
on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.

LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the
Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.

DISSOLVE TO:

154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK
A rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls
up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to
the padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.

After a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.

LAURIE
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?

DREIBERG
Memory lane.

He opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.

155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER
Inside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.

LAURIE
Daniel . . .

DREIBERG
Gimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.

She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull
it back to reveal . . .

THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit
tarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.
DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around
to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.

LAURIE
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.

DREIBERG
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.

156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on
the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,
reliving days gone by.

LAURIE
Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?

DREIBERG
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some
cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.

LAURIE
Antarctica??

DREIBERG
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come
along.
(pause)
I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a
bad place to sit out a war.

LAURIE
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be
left.

DREIBERG
You and me.

He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her
gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the
cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly
rejected.

DREIBERG
. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there
anyway.

Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just
opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES
-- their old superhero togs.

LAURIE
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.

DREIBERG
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.
(chuckling)
The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping
people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't
know.  It all seems so abstract.

LAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing
herself in a small mirror above a sink.

LAURIE
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.

DREIBERG
What are you up to?

LAURIE
Don't look.  Turn around.

Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the
cabin.

DREIBERG
This'd better not be what I think it is.

LAURIE
Okay!

DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite
imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns
shock:

DREIBERG (cont.)
My God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender
of the weak!

LAURIE
In the flesh.

She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,
and strokes his thinning hair.

LAURIE (cont.)
Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.

DREIBERG
Saving the world?  I guess I do.
(smiling)
Maybe we can still save ourselves . . .

DISSOLVE TO:

157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK
A massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned
out; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met
by CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous
BOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and
hawks, they're all frightened as hell.

Things are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.
The end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to
happen.

MAN ON STAGE
You know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're
sitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right --
a first strike!

VOICE IN CROWD
You think the reds ain't doing the same thing?

MAN ON STAGE
Then for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But
we can't stop it!!

VOICE IN CROWD II
It's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!

VOICE IN CROWD III
Dr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!

VOICE IN CROWD IV
It's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!

A HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:

HECKLER
Russia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us
no mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!

MAN ON STAGE
You think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the
end of the world!!

The two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the
stage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start
swinging rifle butts.

As PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of
HOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --
outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials
""CTU""

158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
CTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.

CTU CAPTAIN
I've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.

159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
PANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their
midst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.

LOUDSPEAKER
CEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.

A couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,
turn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling
rocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.

CUT TO:

160. INT. BARN - DUSK
DREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,
wiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:

DREIBERG
Guess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?

No reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.

161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
LAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her
face is distraught, agonized.

LAURIE
Daniel, you ought to take a look at this.

Onscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the
CTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs
below.

DREIBERG
What the hell -- ?

LAURIE
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.

DREIBERG
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.

He turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.

LAURIE
They're just mowing 'em down.
(pause)
This is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we

CUT TO:

162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>
We're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE
OWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,
like the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws
closer, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out
NIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.

There's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless
motions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as
the Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy
equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --

-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE
TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the
action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in
full-color and real-time --

163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the
Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.
Seaport!

164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.

DREIBERG
Okay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.

On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.

165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT
A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.

CTU RADAR MAN
Sir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .

The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --

166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT
-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured
ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets
sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against
the water.

167. ANGLE ON CROWD
pointing at the skies in disbelief.

VOICE IN CROWD
LOOK!  UP THERE!

VOICE IN CROWD II
Oh my God, it's --


168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG
He barks into a microphone:

DREIBERG
Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --

169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the
OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:

OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
-- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!

CTU LOUDSPEAKER
UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
BABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.

The crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But
a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the
strange sight overhead.

VOICE IN CROWD
. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!

EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,
clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging
immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West
showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
into position.

170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.

DREIBERG
We're gonna have to shave this one close.

An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle
FULL-FORWARD.

171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS
CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond
before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES
FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD
CHEERS.

172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the
aft view from the ship.

LAURIE
They're following us.

DREIBERG
All right.  Mission accomplished.

He's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the
ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.

173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU
SHIPS rip past on either side.

174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT
ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The
OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE
blows a HOLE in its facade.

175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.

176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar
readout:

LAURIE
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!

DREIBERG
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.

LAURIE
(checking the monitor)
They're practically on us . . .

DREIBERG
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

He punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled ""TURBO.""

177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP
The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving
the CTU craft in the dust.

178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT
A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,
and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.

A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The
less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and
EXPLODES

The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last
moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP
ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles
for the airborne route.

179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER
The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the
cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.

There's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges
UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS
against the roof of the tunnel.

180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.

DREIBERG
Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.

181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an
almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its
wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --
but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward
on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the
water.

182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
They're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of
intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.

LAURIE
We lost him.

He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she
shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.

LAURIE (cont.)
Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.

FADE THROUGH TO:

183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving
line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall
and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of
him.

TRUSTY
Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.

The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes
through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,
it's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named
T-BONE.

CON IN LINE
Otis went down.

T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of
SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the
biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:
LITTLE BIGGER.

T-BONE
Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.

LITTLE BIGGER
Fuckin' Rorschach.
(nodding to himself)
This joint goes up.  Tonight.

184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship
emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale
blue moonlight.

185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then
disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour
of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is
singing ""You're My Thrill.""

Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the
controls.

The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the
width of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it
right.

It's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.
The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the
cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.

LAURIE
Better.  Much better.

DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile
instead.

LAURIE (cont.)
I bet I know what made the difference this time.

DREIBERG
What?

LAURIE
(smirking)
The costumes.  Am I right?

DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite
himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.

LAURIE (cont.)
Come on.  Admit it!

DREIBERG
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.

LAURIE
Yes you are.

DREIBERG
(drily)
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.
(pause; then, seriously)
Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.

LAURIE
That's because --

DREIBERG
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's
about to end.
(a weird smile)
I feel like I could save it.

He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to
the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship
hard right.

LAURIE
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?

DREIBERG
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .
(turning to face her)
I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.

LAURIE
. . . What??

DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches
for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.

186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through
the clouds above the city.

CUT TO:

187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON
-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL
as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:
disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,
throwing food.

188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are
riveted to a monitor over the controls:

DREIBERG
I think we're just a trifle late.

LAURIE
Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .

The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below
them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire
with the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.

DREIBERG
I know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen
times.

189. INT. CELL - NIGHT
SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs
drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.

190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT
Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past
sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR
MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the
psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,
and T-BONE.

Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop
outside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.

LITTLE BIGGER
Find an outlet for this thing
(shouting)
Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!

RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying
a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's
door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.

CARLOS
See this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .
and pickle 'em!!
(chortling)
Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!

HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place
at the panel in the door:

T-BONE
Lemme see.  Lemme see!

LITTLE BIGGER
Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.
(to T-BONE)
What's he doin' now?

No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed
tightly to the panel.

LITTLE BIGGER (cont.)
You deaf?  I said, what's he --

He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over
backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON
quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye
socket.

RAFE
BOSS!  JESUS!

LITTLE BIGGER
Son of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE
A GRAPE.
(to RAFE)
Light the torch.

RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of
RORSCHACH's cage.

191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the
inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.

CUT TO:

192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic
EARMUFFS.

DREIBERG
Okay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof
running . . .

He throws a switch on the control panel.

193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH
splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop
their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as
the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .

194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT
The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S
FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the
wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his
TOILET.

Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its
mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is
FLOODED.

195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER
RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.

RAFE
Okay, boss, that oughta do it.

They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER
come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.

LITTLE BIGGER
WHAT THE --

RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but
there's no trace of RORSCHACH.

CARLOS
Rorschach.  Company's calling . . .

RAFE
Where is the fuckin' runt?

CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his
fist.

196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
In answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.
He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of
the LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .

. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,
monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide
and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.

CARLOS
YOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --

From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor
BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --

-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --

-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do
a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --

-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock
DIM and DIE.

LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down
off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies
of the dead.

RORSCHACH
Your move . . . runt.

The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor
as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.

197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to
get their bearings.

LAURIE
Where are we?  What happened to the lights?

DREIBERG
Generators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .
. .

Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND
CORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a
SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.

DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a
familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.

DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach??

RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second
and a half -- then keeps on walking.

198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He
throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.
Desperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.

RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,
LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross
corridor.

LAURIE
Rorschach!  Is that you??

He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and
dispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand
at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.

LAURIE
What's he doing?

DREIBERG
I think he's going to the john.

LAURIE
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and
he stops to take a --

Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a
paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a
""howdy.""

DREIBERG
. . . That was quick.

RORSCHACH
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.
(beat)
Let's get out of here.

CUT TO:

199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT
A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.

Air Force One is coming in for a landing.

200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER
Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling
about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.

SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and
what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal
ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an
imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating
a long stay.

PRESIDENT NIXON
Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?

SECRETARY LIDDY
She's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right
away.

LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless
corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.

SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)
Weatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour
window.

PRESIDENT NIXON
Fourteen hours, huh?

SECRETARY LIDDY
Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.

CUT TO:

201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
LAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen
. . .

NEWSCASTER
-- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place
the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --

. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control
console, occupied by other matters.

DREIBERG
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his
mangy cat on me.

DREIBERG
What new information?

RORSCHACH
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan
somehow involved . . .
(scratching his chin)

Strange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.

There's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,
highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.

DREIBERG
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.

LAURIE
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?

Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at
the monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the
screen:

NEWSCASTER
. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was
unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the
Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.

RORSCHACH
""Ozone layer""?

DREIBERG
(rolling his eyes)
Christ.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??

CUT TO:

202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of
pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous
strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered
around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is
one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.

203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT
The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian
style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad
figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered
LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.
One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a
silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back
of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.

LACKEY
Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.

VEIDT
Feed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.

They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him
to:

204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT
The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated
REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,
RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.

VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal
a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,
picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more
informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,
a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in
and his eyes begin to rove.

205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL
PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,
sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled ""LONDON.""
VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense
logo . . .

BBC NEWSCASTER
-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as
possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter
can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --

FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to
the right, to the monitor labelled ""WASHINGTON D.C.""  Sound up:

NEWSCASTER
-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have
already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen
insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing
negotiations --

FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the
bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic
retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new
angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are
clear.  FLICK --

-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're
watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from
twenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas
canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to
propose.

206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT
eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.

CUT TO:

207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.
On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.

208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of
the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,
gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,
POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.

DREIBERG
They've got my building surrounded.
(looking up at her)
They must've been following you all along.

She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the
accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.

DREIBERG (cont.)
So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.

LAURIE
Welcome back, Night Owl.

DREIBERG
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?

RORSCHACH
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.

DREIBERG
What do you mean, frame-up?

RORSCHACH
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --

DREIBERG
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to
get back at us?
(spreading his hands)
What about all those poor shits with cancer?

TIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting
distress.

RORSCHACH
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive
propaganda scheme . . .

DREIBERG
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --

LAURIE
(interrupting him)
It's not.

RORSCHACH
Not what?

LAURIE
Not ""propaganda.""
(pause; then, blurting it out --)
Christ, I'm one of them!  I've got it.

DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face
bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her
grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can
think of anything to say.

Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the ""case,"" breaks the
silence.

RORSCHACH
Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.

209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he
pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily
at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers
above.

210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.

LAURIE
I should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between
us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --

DREIBERG
It doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.

He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up
with tears.

LAURIE
I love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get
myself together, okay?

211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.
RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of
satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees
DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.

Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.

212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona
resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.

LAURIE
Jon.  What are you doing here?

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.

LAURIE
Collect me?

DR. MANHATTAN
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.
You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .

LAURIE
Jon, no -- I can't --

DR. MANHATTAN
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us
can do anything to change it.

DREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside
the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.
MANHATTAN's hand.

DREIBERG
LAURIE!  DON'T --

Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and
LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.

Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can
do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.

RORSCHACH
Where's Laurie?

DREIBERG
I don't think she's coming with us.

DISSOLVE TO:

213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT
A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian
surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later
LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,
then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red
sands.

DR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a
problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at
the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back
and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by
a HALO OF OXYGEN.

DR. MANHATTAN
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.

LAURIE
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --

Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she
stops in her tracks.

Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a
PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren
sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,
surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and
pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering
crystalline castle.

DR. MANHATTAN
I live here now.

He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after
him.

CUT TO:

214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the
glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.

RORSCHACH
Heading south.  What's the plan?

DREIBERG
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're
hightailing it down to Adrian's.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --

DREIBERG
(exploding)
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to
end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't
matter.

RORSCHACH
Coward.  Giving up.

DREIBERG
SHUT UP, Rorschach.

RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.

RORSCHACH
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.
(pause)
Sorry about Laurie.

DREIBERG
(choked voice)
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well
enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.

CUT TO:

215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals
around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the
enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING
-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.

LAURIE
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me
you're sleeping with Dreiberg.

LAURIE
You -- you know about me and Dan?

He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.

DR. MANHATTAN
Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll
finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.

LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.

LAURIE
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?
(flustered)
Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks
at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of
atoms.

DR. MANHATTAN
(startled)
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?

LAURIE
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.

DR. MANHATTAN
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even
my responses.
(nodding)
We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --
Thirty seconds.

She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle
of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles
below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent
WIND whips across their faces.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way
out toward the edge of the universe.
(staring out at the landscape)
Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?

She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and
fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and
frightened.

LAURIE
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me
once?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.

LAURIE
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be
being with me.

DR. MANHATTAN
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't
know what did.

LAURIE
But you knew that I'd -- die.

DR. MANHATTAN
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to
dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .
(pause)
You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.

LAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.

LAURIE
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've
always known.

DR. MANHATTAN
(nodding)
Always.  Ever since the day I died.

He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the
forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in
her hands.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me
these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be
destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless
agent of its destruction?

LAURIE
(sobbing)
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!

DR. MANHATTAN
Because --

LAURIE
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.
(angrily)
Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six
hundred years.

That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the
shoulders:

LAURIE
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to
die I want to be with -- other people.

DR. MANHATTAN
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a
universe to explore.  I'll be alone.
(reaching for her hand)
You're the last human being I'll ever see.

CUT TO:

216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south
Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and
begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .

217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.
Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad
tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:

RORSCHACH
What happened?

DREIBERG
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some
kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.

RORSCHACH
What caused it?

DREIBERG
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --
(apprehensively)
-- outside of a nuclear blast.

DISSOLVE TO:

218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT
VEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible
through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.

219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.

A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.

220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.

221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
Through the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.

DREIBERG
I¹m taking her down.
(frantically throwing switches)
Radar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --

The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.

222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.

A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.

223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.

As he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.

224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:

VOICE
Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.

DREIBERG
Adrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.

Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.

DREIBERG (cont.)
Adrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!

He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.

RORSCHACH
. . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.

225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.

The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.

226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT
DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.

DREIBERG
Can¹t move . . . we¹re done for.

RORSCHACH
Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.

RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Veidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.

227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT
VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.

TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.

VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX
growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's
neck: quiet, girl.

RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN
FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening
scene.  Suddenly . . .

RORSCHACH
VEIDT!

VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;
it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG
backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward
him, TEETH BARED.

VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a
futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --
part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.

DREIBERG
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?

RORSCHACH
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.

DREIBERG
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --

VEIDT
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of
course . . .

DREIBERG
The missing scientists.

VEIDT
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked
at Gila Flats.

RORSCHACH
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .

VEIDT
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save
the world.

228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.
RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping
at his heels.

VEIDT
Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers
-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.
(tapping his chest)
It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill
him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my ""assassination"" --
that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting
rid of Dr. Manhattan.

DREIBERG
What??

VEIDT
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.

RORSCHACH
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.

VEIDT
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.
(smiling)
He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a
little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates
cancer.

DREIBERG
Laurie?  You're responsible for --

VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls
out a smoke and strikes it against the box.

VEIDT (cont.)
One thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate
than it is to cure.

DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the
stun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and
LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.

VEIDT
Let's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you
without a moment's thought.

They've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200
SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them
inside.

RORSCHACH
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.

VEIDT
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking
at.

229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand
corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila
Flats, reassembling a WATCH.

DREIBERG
What is this?  It looks like Jon.

VEIDT
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.
Manhattan.

DREIBERG
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?

VEIDT
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.

CUT TO:

230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,
LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's
hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On
Mars.

DR. MANHATTAN
I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a
mystery I'd like to penetrate.

LAURIE
Jon, I do not want to hear it.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .

LAURIE
(shaking her head)
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.

DR. MANHATTAN
You're the only human being I care for.

LAURIE
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter
a bit.
(pause)
I want you to cure me.

DR. MANHATTAN
I won't do that.

LAURIE
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.

DR. MANHATTAN
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.

LAURIE
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you
-- then do it.

Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her
chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.

Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.
MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the
hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .

A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN
INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian
landscape altogether.

With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see
the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great
white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the
Martian desert gradually materialize around them.

The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like
statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.

LAURIE
What -- am I --

DR. MANHATTAN
Cured, yes.

Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a
handrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart
attack.

LAURIE
Jon, what is it?  What's the matter?

When he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with
DREAD.

DR. MANHATTAN
Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on
me.  -- I can't remember the future.

Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around
him.

LAURIE
Jon.  Let's go back to Earth.

CUT TO:

231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT
VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.
room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring
machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.

Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON
OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into
its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching
him from twenty-four years in the future.

VEIDT
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.
(pause)
Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.

DREIBERG
What is it?  How does it work?

VEIDT
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow
backward in time.
(smiling)
There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing
parallel to our own --

DREIBERG
Adrian -- you've lost it.

VEIDT
(pointing at the tachyon bubble)
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
(pause)

In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it
survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.

He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.

VEIDT (cont.)
The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.
(wild-eyed)
Do you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!

232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT
DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.

LAURIE
We¹re too late.

DR. MANHATTAN
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .

LAURIE
Jon -- what??

DR. MANHATTAN
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.

233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.

VEIDT
At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.

He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.

VEIDT
It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.
(turning to face them)
In a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.

DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.

RORSCHACH
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.

DREIBERG
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.

VEIDT
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?

DREIBERG
And what if you¹re wrong?

VEIDT
I¹m not.

DREIBERG
What if you¹re wrong??

VEIDT
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!
(shouting)
I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!

234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.

DR. MANHATTAN
That¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.

LAURIE
Jon, where are we?

DR. MANHATTAN
Veidt¹s complex.

235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT

Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:

VEIDT
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years
chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .
as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.

DREIBERG
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist
bullshit is going to save the world?

VEIDT
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.

He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.
Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.

236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS
In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears
a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .

237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon
bubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up
--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the
trigger . . .

. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.
VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .

. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with
LAURIE at his side.

DR. MANHATTAN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?

VEIDT
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.

DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees
himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of
the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's
surprised.

In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to
sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN
THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.

VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He
shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and
points his STUN GUN directly at her --

-- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.

VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --

VEIDT
NO!!!!

-- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.

DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.

LAURIE
What was he doing?

DREIBERG
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --

DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.

DR. MANHATTAN
He was right.

RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.

DR. MANHATTAN
He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.

DR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.

LAURIE
Jon --

DR. MANHATTAN
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.

LAURIE
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?

DR. MANHATTAN
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!

He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz
around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the
room dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the
world into his own massive frame.

DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished . . .

The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to
happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the
test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the
tiny
hole in time.

He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS
into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND
STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.

238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter
bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling
gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.

DR. MANHATTAN
Don't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.

A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps
forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.

For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame
surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.
MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the
chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across
the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he
spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding
FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging
with nothingness . . .

. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue
light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's
alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.

239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER
The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of
his awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation
panel.

SCIENTIST
What in the name of God . . .

The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,
sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As
she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he
looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .

JON
Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --

SCIENTIST II
LOOK!!

The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .
. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular
RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are
three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and
RORSCHACH.

240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT
DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the
astounded SCIENTISTS.

LAURIE
What happened -- ?

DREIBERG
He saved himself.  He changed the past.

LAURIE
Where did he go?

Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to
THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For
a moment everything's back to normal --

-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to
DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.

A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around
them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge
into . . .

241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT
DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an
otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time
could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this
would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;
their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they
know it, they find themselves deposited --

242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT
-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them
materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,
slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the
same, knocking over a fire hydrant.

LAURIE
Dan, is this -- is this New York??

DREIBERG
Those cars.  What year is this??

LAURIE
Everything's changed --

It's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's
our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,
the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of
whack . . .

RORSCHACH
Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.

BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the
obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of
course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden
presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:
Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?

RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too
close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to
several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection
altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a
shrill WHISTLE.

DREIBERG
Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!

243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT
The same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our
world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: ""RUSSIAN SUMMIT
TALKS COLLAPSE.""  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR
is gapin at the ruckus on the street.

NEWS VENDOR
Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.

His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to
the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.

KID
Shit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!

NEWS VENDOR
What are you talkin' about?

KID
Superheroes!  Check it out!

He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to
join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares
down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- ""WATCHMEN"" --
then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the
street.

KID
All right!  They must be on a case.

244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed
with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived
to clear the streets and restore order.

COP I
Break it up!  Stand back!

COP II
Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --

DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.
They don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The
taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant
to advance.

LAURIE
Dan -- what do we do now?

DREIBERG
(panicked)
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --

LAURIE
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't
they -- ?

RORSCHACH
They'd better.

And on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and

FADE OUT.

234,With You All The Way,"[Verse 1: DeQuarius Slaton]
Girl, if ever the going got rough
You never
Were the type to think of backing down
So when you got more than your share
In a minute, I knew your heart was in it
I knew that it would make you be your best
Put you to the test
But if sometimes it seems not worth the battle
That's when you'll see
You can count on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm with you all the way
I'll never give up this dream
Although it may seem
There's no way out today (Oh, girl)
Yes, I'm with you all the way
Whatever places love might put us through
Remember I'm with you
With you all the way

[Verse 2: DeQuarius]
When you see me
Your eyes say that you need me
But there's another feeling they can't hide
And it hurts so deep inside
To think maybe before I'd let you down
Won't you hear me out now
Believe me somehow

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm with you all the way
I'll never give up the dream
Although it may seem
There's no way out today (Oh, girl)
Yes, I'm with you all the way
Whatever places love might put us through
Remember I'm with you
With you all the way

I thought I'd never know just where to start
Delivering this promise from my heart
Holding you here in my arms

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)

236,Crush On You,"[Verse 1: Legacy]
Look, I went over pick-up lines in front of mirrors all the time?
Mandatory cause I st-st-stuttered every time I tried
If it's only when it's fit for you I bet that I'm a guy
You my heart, if you leave me then I bet that I'm a die
See Wiz said I had to get you from your man
And Biz told me that you said he's just a friend
Drug dealer heard he spits cheese with the hobos
His checks keep bouncing
That's b's on a pogo
Why don't you say no to Rumo
You either date me or Juno you want a lame is for Pluto
I wanna make a new move for your benefits
It isn't that hard to pick
My sex outta this world she call me Martian dick
I don't mean to diss yo man but I like you shit has been wet
Since I was ten I was tryna get a chance
She won't even give me that it's weird, you know that
Think I came off wrong, here I'll start over

Like wassup, I don't really mean to be rude

Shit ,what you waiting for check yes or check no
Uh, it started out I had a party at my house

Another chick talkin' bout she got a blunt rolled up
And so I did the done got it
Cause I'm bouta make it happen and she had another friend
So I'm bouta got it crackin'
Smoke a blunt outside no lighter bustin' matches
And I only hit the blunt cause I knew she was givin action
You can't pass on that bro plus she was bomb
And she got some nice hips, the girls get it from momma
Hit the sex room then we gotta change up the genre
This girl gone wild, I think I'm lovin' her persona
She like to wear Prada, Louie V and Gabbana
Street clothes over lingerie on the bottom
I can't stop starin', adrenaline rush
But I had to suck it up and tell this cutie wassup

Like wassup, I don't really mean to be rude
But last time I seen you with dude
I heard ya'll broke up bummer

[Verse 3: YG]
Babe, what's your name, where you goin', baby, can I come?
Let you empty out my bank account, insufficient funds
I you know you wanna hang like wet clothes
She whispered in my ear like let's go
We can hop in the Beamer or Lexus
I'm tryna buss and I ain't talkin' 'bout the metro
I'm nasty, yup, I don't give a fuck
It's a target on your pussy, bet I hit it up
Can't stop, won't stop like the young bounds
I got some thing me and you can do for fun, fun
So what's the deal, is you with the business?
She can't take the dick she won't let a nigga finish
She back it up, back it up and take a pose
She doin' shit that make me wanna take her home
I'm like get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, girl
I smack her on the ass and tell her to get it some more

Stood there boldly
Sweatin' in the sun
Felt like a million
Felt like number one
The height of summer
I'd never felt that strong
Like a rock

I was eighteen
Didn't have a care
Working for peanuts
Not a dime to spare
But I was lean and
Solid everywhere
Like a rock

My hands were steady
My eyes were clear and bright
My walk had purpose
My steps were quick and light
And I held firmly
To what I felt was right
Like a rock

[Verse 4]
Like a rock, I was strong as I could be
Like a rock, nothin' ever got to me
Like a rock, I was something to see
Like a rock

[Verse 5]
And I stood arrow straight
Unencumbered by the weight
Of all these hustlers and their schemes
I stood proud, I stood tall
High above it all
I still believed in my dreams

[Verse 6]
Twenty years now
Where'd they go?
Twenty years
I don't know
I sit and I wonder sometimes
Where they've gone

[Verse 7]
And sometimes late at night
When I'm bathed in the firelight
The moon comes callin' a ghostly white
And I recall
I recall

Like a rock, standin' arrow straight
Like a rock, chargin' from the gate
Like a rock, carryin' the weight

We'd be breaking out, instead of falling in

That keep the unseen from your skin

I can't wait, no I can't wait

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin-a?
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin'
To look sexy, but even if she was, so what?
Motherfucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that let's me know that she's a human being
And being human's hard—on the boulevard
Girl, you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm André, Benjamin André to be exact
You'd hope to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced us at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes, you're getting booed if your shit do not get down
And yes, you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your Speakerboxxx?
""Pink and Blue"", you're lollygaggin', you're slow pokin'
You got me open, you're playin' wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if Anita Baker brings the joy
Your kind are the Tyner, meanin' the real McCoy

Sir Luscious is the real deal but even he gets antsy

But patience is a virtue to being anxious, just might hurt you

Should I play it cool or be the one to make the first move?

[Verse 1]
Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke

Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh

It's not enough, to say I want ya
Cause I'll say anything

If you say go, I would stop everything oh

246,I Wanna Be A Cowboy,"Riding on the range
I've got my hat - on
I've got my boots - dusty

I've got my saddle

I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy

(woman's voice)
Riding on the chuck wagon
Following my man
His name is Ted
Can you believe that?
Camping on the prairie
Plays havoc with my hair
Makes me feel quite dirty
Though we all do sometimes

I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy
And you can be my cowgirl
I wanna be a cowboy

Looking like a hero
Six-gun at my side
Chewing my tobacco
Out on the horizon
I see a puff of smoke
Indians on the warpath

247,A Different Corner,"[Verse 1]
I'd say love was a magical thing
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there
I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare
Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared

[Verse 2]
Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care
I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love
And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear",George Michael,1986,"[94, 80, 60, 44, 28, 16, 7, 7, 7, 10, 15, 21, 26, 37, 44, 57]",16
248,I'm Your Man,"[Verse 1]
If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner
Take my hand
Or if you want to strike me down in anger
Here I stand
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver
Climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
I'm your man

[Verse 3]
Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
Ah but a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
And I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please (Please)
I'm your man

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
And if you've got to sleep
A moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while
Across the sand
I'm your man

249,The Finest,"[Intro: MF Doom]
As the life cycle goes on ... goes on
And you learn to hold on (hold on)
To things like the mic ... the mic
And you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device
But who is (The finest)

[Verse 1: Tommy Gunn + MF Doom]
Tommy Tashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor
Time and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor
Tommy Tashuma, no time for humor
As soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead, you trying to find Pumas
Sooner the better, even knitted a sweater already
Keep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather
We ready to do whatever, yo' Doom you with it?
You know it like a poet, my brother
Hey, Gunn you wit it? Whatever... [the finest!]

[Verse 2: MF Doom]
I know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off
To bust a shell off, to dick-riders: ""Get the hell off""
Made a call to a client, he must've had his cell off
A show-off, he has the same bike Puff fell off
I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts
Which niggas is wack 'til they last two tracks
Matter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell
The tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell

[Verse 3: Tommy Gunn]
When die, he gon' die like a soldier die:
Holding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold
Smoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach
Blowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die
He gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky

[Verse 4: MF Doom]
Yup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup
This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up
I need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up
Niggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up

[Verse 5: Megalon]
Stands up and hold 'em high, do or die
He got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes
Got the weed, rolling lah
Not sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply
Within the prophecies hold the lie

[Verse 6: MF Doom]
He bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me, OD
Ghetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me
A OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed me
Sci-Fly, whole style stuck up
Used to talk to myself, I told him, ""Shut the fuck up!""
Buckle up, cause it's about to be rough
He said, ""Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed""
Then we squashed it, I let em know: ""Watch it --
We only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit""
Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance
For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor

[Verse 7: Megalon + MF Doom]
I pull ya' top up, got clout, crack rock, what?
Now it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up
On the dance floor: you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up
Baby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete
Damn, I just shook your hand and can't stand you already
Can't stand you, understand you deadly
But my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy
Yo' Doom, you ready?
Yeah! Yo' Gunn, you with it?
Whatever

[Verse 8: MF Doom]
Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day
Remind me of the same style I flipped on ""Hey!""
Yikes! Who can fuck with the likes
Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's
Metal grill, with many styles, better still
Feel like number 26 on a roulette wheel
And deal, and run rings around rhymers
And run rings like number runners whose old-timers

[Verse 9: Megalon]
Shorty in the all black, she think she all that
I called her, she said, ""Don't call back!""
She called me, now what you call that?
Let's go back, I sold crack
Hold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that
Fuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at?

[Verse 10: MF Doom]
Suffering succotash! This hooker broke into his last buck of cash
He love her, motherfuck her ass
Metal feet dented your car fender
My agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender
Is unbeknownst to you -- who could get body blown?
MF like Mike Fran Corleone
And got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at?
An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act
Raised by a pack a wild womens like Sweetback
Front? I'mma be back! (Like brothers in the street act)
(Surrounded by a bunch a bad bitches like Sweetback)
(Fuck with me I'll be back)
Like niggas in the streets act (streets act!)

If she knew what she wants

If she knew what she needs
(He could give her that too)
If she knew what she wants
(But he can't see through her)
If she knew what she wants
He'd be giving it to her
Giving it to her

But she wants everything
(He can pretend to give her everything)
Or there's nothing she wants

But she's open to change
Then one day she's satisfied
And the next I'll find her crying

Giving it to her (giving it to her)

[Bridge]
Some have a style
That they work hard to refine
So they walk a crooked line
But she won't understand
Why anyone would have to try
To walk a line when they could fly

[Verse 2]
No sense thinking I could rehabilitate her
When she's fine, fine, fine
She's got so many ideas traveling around in her head
She doesn't need nothing from mine

If she knew what she wants

If she knew what she needs
(He'd be givin' it too)
If she knew what she wants

If she knew what she wants
He'd be giving it to her
Giving it to her

But she wants everything

Or there's nothing she wants

He's crazy for this girl
(But she don't know what she's looking for)
If she knew what she wants
He'd be giving it to her

On the road
Holding on to the end of the rope

Were you left behind to find your way home?
To cries and lie
Six feet deep in lies
Can you hold your ""now""?
Where were you when the lights went down?
And I--I will be right beside you

Look inside
See the misery deep in your eyes
Have you lost yourself?
Are you out of tears for the times you cried?
A heart of stone
Cold and left alone
Can you hold me now?
Will you still be here when the lights go down?
And I--I will be right beside you

You're not alone

254,Mountains,"Far over the Misty Mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day
To seek our pale enchanted gold

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, on twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun

Far over the Misty Mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day
To claim our long-forgotten gold

Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold, where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves

The pines were roaring on the heights
The wind was moaning in the night
The fire was red, it flaming spread
The trees like torches blazed with light

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale
The dragon's ire, more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail

The mountain smoked beneath the moon
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom
They fled the hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon

Far over the Misty Mountains grim
To dungeons deep and caverns dim
We must away, ere break of day
To win our harps and gold from him!

The wind was on the withered heath
But in the forest stirred no leaf
There shadows lay be night or day
And dark things silent crept beneath

The wind came down from mountains cold
And like a tide it roared and rolled
The branches groaned, the forest moaned
And leaves were laid upon the mould

The wind went on from West to East;
All movement in the forest ceased
But shrill and harsh across the marsh
Its whistling voices were released

The grasses hissed, their tassels bent
The reeds were rattling--on it went
O'er shaken pool under heavens cool
Where racing clouds were torn and rent

It passed the Lonely Mountain bare
And swept above the dragon's lair
There black and dark lay boulders stark
And flying smoke was in the air

It left the world and took its flight
Over the wide seas of the night
The moon set sail upon the gale
And stars were fanned to leaping light

Under the Mountain dark and tall
The King has come unto his hall!
His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread
And ever so his foes shall fall!

The sword is sharp, the spear is long
The arrow swift, the Gate is strong
The heart is bold that looks on gold
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells

On silver necklaces they strung
The light of stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, from twisted wire
The melody of harps they wrung

The mountain throne once more is freed!
O! Wandering folk, the summons heed!
Come haste! Come haste! Across the waste!
The king of friend and kin has need

Now call we over the mountains cold
'Come back unto the caverns old!
Here at the gates the king awaits
His hands are rich with gems and gold

The king has come unto his hall
Under the Mountain dark and tall
The Wyrm of Dread is slain and dead
And ever so our foes shall fall

Farewell we call to hearth and hall!
Though wind may blow and rain may fall
We must away, ere break of day
Far over the wood and mountain tall

To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell
In glades beneath the misty fell
Through moor and waste we ride in haste
And whither then we cannot tell

With foes ahead, behind us dread
Beneath the sky shall be our bed
Until at last our toil be passed
Our journey done, our errand sped

We must away! We must away!
We ride before the break of day!",J. R. R. Tolkien,1986,"[92, 54, 37, 25, 23, 24, 27, 33, 44, 49, 58]",11

Told me that things was dubs I swear to you they was tens
Whatever she had it all and shockingly had no kids
It was 2010, introduced through my nig
Hey how you doing? where you been?
Baby my name is Trizz i'm trying to go to the crib, possibly get it in
She told me she wasn't with it but said we could still be friends
Two years later i'm seeing this bitch again
Hair fucked up walking with two of her kids
Ain't that some shit? Thirsty ass bitch ain't seen me in 2 years and tryna ride in my whip
Bitches ain't shit, it's funny how bitches get
I gave her some bus fare, two dollars and fifty cents
My personal fairy tale on bitches and how it is
They could be doing well and instantly turn to shit
Look at this bitch

How you go from 3 cars, four jobs, ass looking like Minaj
To a fucking ford Taurus and you live in a garage
Had all the new shoes, two purses and the bomb
Now its like you have SARS and the tissue on it scarred
Captain Piccard I was higher than the stars
When I 87 bust in to your crib without a heart
Right around the corner from the Arby's, god golly
Now you had too many molly, it done ruined your little body
Remember you told me that your momma was going to get you a Bugatti
You ain't mobbing in no Rarri, let's go for calamari
Take me out to the movies and touch all over my body
All you do is fucking beg, now you hella fucking sorry
Pity date, I tried to reminisce on your pretty face
Titties late sagging, plus your pussy like a city-state
So many niggas at to the birthday party trying to hit the cake

Used to see you on Sundays but now you pass church
I pray for you hope you get it right girl
Used to love the green but now your nose all in white girl
I know its hard but it's life girl
But you can have the same shit too if you strive girl

Wouldn't fuck me cause a nigga was a little too chubby

Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Verse 2]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing along

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me

The hardest part is beginning
By the time you find where you belong

When you want somebody bad enough
Well I want you now
And wherever you go
I'm gonna love ya till

Yours would never be broken
If anybody had a heart like mine

The clothes you wear
They only see what you show them
Let them talk baby I don't care
They don't know where we're goin'
I love you so much
And I have for so long
How could anybody doubt it
Oh just one little touch
This love is so strong
Baby how can we live without it
If everyone had a heart
Yours would never be broken
If anybody had a heart like mine
When you love somebody
You may stumble you may fall
But if you love somebody hard enough
Maybe you can get it all
If everyone had a heart
Yours would never be broken
If anybody had a heart like mine
Anybody in the world
If everyone had a heart
Yours would never be broken

262,Greatest Love Of All,"I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

[Chorus]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I made it up as I went along

I'm gonna miss you for the rest of my life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

You never know what you've got 'til it's gone

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)

Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you

About family and struggle and it takin' forever
About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed

Voici le vrai blase du temps : Chuck Liddell
Mâche un bout de vie et recrache un bout de vide
Clash un crew de filles, relis quelques pages d'un doux d'Ovide
Trace un trou d'office, l'homme moderne n'est qu'un fou docile
Pire qu'un faux dossier, ""Liberté"" n'est plus qu'un mot grossier

Sous des parquets de verre tous tes paquets de mecs

272,In The Shape Of A Heart,"It was a ruby that she wore
On a chain around her neck
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart
It was a time I won't forget
For the sorrow and regret
And the shape of a heart
And the shape of a heart

I guess I never knew
What she was talking about
I guess I never knew
What she was living without

People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove
Speak in terms of belief and belonging
Try to fit some name to their longing
People speak of love

There was a hole left in the wall
From some ancient fight
About the size of a fist
Or something thrown that had missed
And there were other holes as well
In the house where our nights fell
Far too many to repair
In the time that we were there

People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Reach out to each other through the push and shove
Speak in terms of a life and the learning
Try to think of a word for the burning

You keep it up
You try so hard
To keep a life from coming apart
And never know
What breaches and faults are concealed
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart

It was the ruby that she wore
On a stand beside the bed
In the hour before dawn
When I knew she was gone
And I held it in my hand
For a little while
Dropped it into the wall
I let it go and heard it fall

I guess I never knew
What she was talking about
I guess I never knew
What she was living without

People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove
Speak in terms of a life and the living
Try to find the word for forgiving

You keep it up
You try so hard
To keep a life from coming apart
And never know
The shallows and the unseen reefs
That are there from the start
In the shape of a heart

I'm gonna keep my body tight

Looking a little bit closer now
I've got something to say to you
And if your body touches me, I just don't know what I might do
And so hold me honey, hit on the bed

He does a lot of nice things for me""

But what has he done for you lately?

282,Rain On The Scarecrow,"Scarecrow on a wooden cross
Blackbird in the barn
Four hundred empty acres
That used to be my farm
Grew up like my daddy did
My grandpa cleared this land
When I was five
I walked the fence while Grandpa held my hand

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
There`s no legacy for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

The crops we grew last summer
Weren`t enough to pay the loans
Couldn`t buy the seed to plant this spring
And the Farmers' Bank foreclosed
Called my old friend Schepman
Up to auction off the land
He said:
""John, it`s just my job
And I hope you understand.""

Hey, calling it your job, ole hoss
Sure don`t make it right
But if you want me to
I`ll say a prayer for your soul tonight

And grandma`s on the front porch swing
With a Bible in her hand
Sometimes I hear her singing
Take me to the Promised Land
When you take away a man`s dignity
He can`t work his fields and cows

There`ll be
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

There`s 97 crosses
Planted in the courthouse yard
Ninety-seven families who
Lost ninety-seven farms

I think about my grandpa
My neighbors and my name
And some nights
I feel like dying
Like that scarecrow in the rain

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
They`re just memories for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

You are all you need
And that is everything
So don't hesitate

Sitting down with my girls
Trying figure out what I'm gonna do
Never though I'd see the day
When the question mark was hanging over you

And it ain't nothing that somebody said
There's no where or when
No when, no where

Time and time again
Yeah, cause

Something's going on
Can't put my finger on it
Something's going on

When we're kissing
Something's missing
Call it female intuition

Monday night
You're looking slick
Well, who's it for
If it ain't for me?

Called you up on Tuesday
And you say
You're busy trying to cook and clean
What you mean?

And lately
You've been switching up your phone
From loud to vibrate
Is that why you've been missing all my calls
Did you plan it that way
That way?

Roads that go nowhere

294,Land Of La La,"[Verse 1]
You were brought up in a small town
Where everyone greeted with a morning smile
I mean the place was so free from crime
You could leave your front door open
And if your eyes were drawn from a lack of food
Or your pockets were short on cash
There was always someone close at hand
That you could always run to
You could have been a doctor
And you could have been a nurse
But these things weren't good enough for you
So you decided to pack up all you own
And get a one-way ticket there
To a place where all the successful people went
In order for them to do

[Chorus]
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
Land of la la
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey
The land of la la

[Verse 2]
You get off the bus, pick up a paper
And look through the classified
So that you might find a place
Suitable for you to move into
Then you turn around to pick up the duffle bag
That you brought along
But much to your surprise you find
Your bag has taken off walking
You dig in your wallet
To get your last dime
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper
You're much too prideful
But pride has no defense
When all you've got in your possession
Is the wallet in your hands

[Chorus]
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Only the strong can survive
Living in the land of la la

L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, living in the land of la la

[Outro over refrain]
You might get everything you want
But not want everything you get
Being in la la land is like nowhere else
Living in the land, one hell of a land, a land full of lost angels
Movie stars and great big cars and Perrier and fun all day
And that's enough to make anybody go wild
In the land of la la
He's a big boy now, she's a strong girl
But only the strong can survive

I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)
(Kisses, kisses)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted (Yah)
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

301,Fire With Fire,"[Verse One]
You have let them arch your back and
Swallowed the toxicity
Hold your own, don't wait and see now
You've let them make you feel bad about
Every little thing you've done
Judge of all things, maker of none

Just kill them with kindness

[Chorus]
Cause you will always be much too strong for someone else
You will always be much too tall for someone else
Don't you try to apologize
Black Star, that's what you are
No one stills the fire in your heart
Fire with fire now

[Verse Two]
You allowed it, you condoned it
You are holding all the cards
All you need is some simple words now
""No"" is a good one, ""hell no"" is better
Open doors by shutting one
It seems impossible until it's done now

Just kill them with kindness

[Chorus]
You will always be much too strong for someone else
You will always be much too tall for someone else
Don't you try to apologize
Black Star, that's what you are
No one stills the fire in your heart

303,Feel It Again,"I used to dance at the devil's feet
He made me feel like I never want to go home

Oh
I thought he'd save my soul
Sipping at the bottom of an empty glass
No I don't remember going to hell and back
But I know

Oh
I was out of control
I don't wanna do this anymore
Gotta pick myself up off the floor

Let it rain
Let it pour
Let the tears come down like a waterfall
I'd rather live with the pain than die
Feeling nothing at all

Throw another penny in the wishing well
One for the road and I tell myself to go home

Oh
It's better than being alone
Heart as cold as a block of ice
Playing with fire and I don't think twice
But I know

Oh
I'm sippin' away my soul
I don't wanna do this anymore
Gotta pick myself up off the floor

Let it rain
Let it pour
Let the tears come down like a waterfall
I'd rather live with the pain than die
Feeling nothing at all
So come on
Let it in
'Cause you can't feel love till you jump right in
So whenever it hits me I'm ready to feel it again

304,Where Do The Children Go,"Surrender into the night
Silently take my hand
Nobody knows what's inside us
Nobody understands
They handed us down a dream
To live in this lonely town
But nobody hears the music
Only the echo of a hollow sound

Where do the children go
Between the bright night and the darkest day
Where do the children go
And who's that deadly piper who leads them away

Together we make our way
Passengers on a train
Whisper a secret forever
Promises in the rain
We're leaving it all behind
While castles are falling down
We're going where no one can find us
And if there's a heaven
We'll find it somehow

Where do the children go
Between the bright night and the darkest day
Where do the children go
And who's that deadly piper who leads them away",The Hooters,1986,"[97, 75, 65, 51, 38, 41, 44, 48, 52, 57, 66, 78]",12
305,I Still Want You,"[Verse 1]
You said you'd be by my side
But now you're gone
Were you lying?
Were you lying to me?
All those times
You said you were mine, mine, mine
Were you lying?
Were you lying to me?

[Chorus]
'Cause I still love you
And I still want you back
But I couldn't put myself
Couldn't put myself through that again
And I still want you
Oh, I want you so bad
Don't know why you’ve got my heart
But I'd like to have it back

[Verse 2]
All those kisses and I love you's
Oh, you didn't mean them
You didn't mean them did you?
All those stories and promises
You didn't keep them
You didn't keep them, did you?

[Chorus]
Yet I still love you
Yet I still want you back
But I wouldn't put myself
Wouldn't put myself through that again
Yet I still want you
Oh, I want you so bad
Don't know why you've got my heart
But I'd like to have it back

[Bridge]
And it's making me sick to the stomach
Imagining you and her in bed
Whispering sweet words to one another
When the night has finally come to an end
And it's making me sick to the stomach
Imagining you and her in bed
Whispering sweet words to one another
When the night has finally come to an end

[Chorus]
Why do I still love you?
Why do I still want you back?
Why would I ever put myself
Ever put myself through that again
Why do I still want you?
Why do I want you so bad?
Don't know why you've got my heart
But I'd like to have it back

It hurts me so bad

306,Pretty In Pink,"Caroline laughs and it's raining all day
She loves to be one of the girls
She lives in the place in the side of our lives
Where nothing is ever put straight

She turns herself round
And she smiles and she says
""This is it, that's the end of the joke""
And loses herself in her dreaming and sleep
And her lovers walk through in their coats

Pretty in pink, isn't she?
Pretty in pink, isn't she?

All of her lovers, all talk of her notes
And the flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy?
And isn't she pretty in pink?

The one who insists he was first in the line
Is the last to remember her name?
He's walking around in this dress that she wore
She is gone but the joke's the same

Pretty in pink, isn't she?
Pretty in pink, isn't she?

Caroline talks to you softly sometimes
She says, ""I love you and too much""
She doesn't have anything you want to steal
Well, nothing you can touch

She waves, she buttons your shirt
The traffic is waiting outside
She hands you this coat
She gives you her clothes, these cars collide

Pretty in pink, isn't she?
Pretty in pink, isn't she?",The Dresden Dolls,1986,"[99, 60, 48, 41, 42, 45, 49, 54, 63, 76, 90]",11
307,Divided Hearts,"You're looking through your window
Into the neon light
You try to forget him
But the feeling keeps you up all night
Flashback, flashback, flashback
Only come from an abstract mind

I look back
I see you in your frame
I only wish I could climb through
But the wall around it stops me all the same
Flashback, flashback
Only come from an abstract mind

Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
Why do they break
We watch them fall to pieces on the ground

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
Why do they break
And we are left with our divided hearts, oh

A standing conversation
Down at the Pink Café
You tellin' me you got reason
But I just can't hear a single word you say
Flashback, flashback
Only color the abstract mind

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts
(Two divided hearts)
Why do they break
We watch them fall to pieces on the ground

(One divided heart)
Divided hearts

The chance we take
And we are left with our divided hearts, oh

308,Stay True,"[Intro: Self-Provoked]
Yo, look

[Verse 1: Self-Provoked]
Finally I'm free I'm seeing shit more clear
Let go of fake friends, they be looking at me weird
Like I became big-headed 'cause of all this music shit
Nah, I just see you for the fool you is
Friends come and friends go
Some turn foes, some try to fuck your ex-hoe
Some remain smart and just let go
I walk a narrow path towards the light
Don't step on other's toes, don't try and start fights (No)
My satellite is picky, it ain't picking up yo' signal (Why?)
I see through you like a stabbed you with a pitch fork, I risk for
For the people I care about
You know moral [?] writers complain about life
'Cause you ain't living it right
Ain't towards progression, steady speakin' on lies
I stay-stay humble with a cookie that don't crumble
You remain-main focused 'bout that shit that bring us trouble

[Chorus]
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
Stay true to the heart

[Verse 2]
Finally I leave this people where they sleep, black sheep, not counting sheep
People tryna cloud me but me, I gotta be free like dreams of those who slept
I walk alone with some homies that I've kept
Not dealin' feelings, I ain't even 'bout to break a sweat
Over this bullshit scent, need change I give em cents
Mind like the moon still beautiful with dense
Positive I keep, like a picture in a locket
'Cause homies turn to foes
I watch 'em tryna knock it
I hope you hear me when I'm knockin' in yo' noggin' when I say all of the lights is shaded
Too much bullshit, that's why I get faded
Too much love dawg, just wait until they hate it
But I ain't even trippin', I'm pushing when I'm kickin'
Collecting water, when it's raining there's a positive to everything
Anything's worth creating, just know
They'll try to break it, they wanna see you failing
So keep that mind right, ignore the bullshit, rather daydream
When life gives you lemons just try and create a painting
Knowing that they're waiting, just so they can ruin it
Block that shit out like sunlight through an eclipse
Life is beautiful, it just depends on how you really live
Be real with yo self, 'cause they don't really give a shit
All you gotta do is trip on far you really get
All you gotta do is trip on far you really get
It's life

[Chorus]
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
But I'll stay faded, love it or hate it
Thinking that I changed but they're the ones changing
Maybe it's the things that I got on my mind
Maybe it's the way that I'm living my life
Stay true to the heart",Bobby Bucher,1986,"[94, 94]",2

312,Never As Good As The First Time,"Never as good
No, baby

Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right

Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you

So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember

Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

It's never as good as the first time
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
It's like the weather
One day chicken, next day feathers

The rose we remember
The thorns we forget
We'd love and leave
We never spend a minute on regret

It is a possibility, the more we know the less we see
Second time, is not quite what it seems
Natural as the way we came to be
The second time, won't live up to the dream

It's never as good as the first time (Never as good)
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
It's natural as the way we came to be
The second time is not quite what it seems

As the first time

313,American Storm,"Headin' out on some uncharted path
You soon turn back
It happens time and time again
You never seem to reach the end
Someone's out there on the street tonight
When things go wrong
He'll guarantee to make them right
If the price is right

Every time I look you're fallin' fallin'
Beaten by the wind
Every time I turn around he's there again

It's like a full force gale
An American storm
You're buried far beneath a mountain of cold
And you never get warm
It's like a wall of mirrors
You charge `em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass
But you never bleed
You never feel the need

Everybody casts a certain light
A special gift
It's theirs to use for wrong or right
When you face the night
More and more we choose the easy way
We take no risks
We figure out which games to play
And how to make 'em pay

Suddenly the pressure's fallin' fallin'
Skies have all turned grey
Suddenly the storm is heading straight your way

It's like a full force gale
Atop a mountain of cold
You tell your story again and again
And it never gets old
It's like a wall of mirrors
You charge 'em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass
But you never bleed
You face a full force gale
An American storm

‘Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, ""Forgive me""
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin'– nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a ""Stop the Violence"" rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishin'; get yo' ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up yo' cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
‘Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, ‘cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', ""Kuniva, yo, yo!""
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

[Verse 6: Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Outro: Eminem]
Ha-ha! Suck my motherfuckin' dick!

Here we are, the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meeting up together
'Cause soon as I looked at you, it would show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can never no, no, no, no, we can't leave a trace

Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously alone by the phone

How could something so wrong be so right?
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight, yeah
Living two lives, just ain't easy at all

Your shadows so close if you are still in love

330,These Dreams,"Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist
Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak 'n dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist
The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life

340,This Could Be The Night,"All of these nights that we've been a-dating
All of these nights that we've been awaiting
Something tells me that the time is getting right
Each time we kiss it takes a little bit longer
And my love for you gets a little bit stronger
And I feel like I'm a-sitting on dynamite

So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more

When it comes to lovin' she's a natural master
And each time she's there, well my heart beats faster
Deep down inside I know the best is yet to come
Oh, gonna pick her up about a quarter to seven
I know we're gonna take a little trip to heaven
And if it's love she wants then I'm gonna give her some

So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more

So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more

This could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more

341,Night Moves,"{intro}

I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high

{hook}

Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods
I used her she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share

Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime
In the sweet summer time, summer time

{Bridge}

And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

344,Shot in the Dark,"[Verse 1]
Out on the streets I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them, I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

[Chorus]
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right

[Verse 2]
Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reasons
I wouldn't listen, I learned how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason
But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

[Chorus]
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right

They'll remember, they'll surrender

One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No  bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide

It's just a dream I had in mind
It’s just a dream I had in mind

[Verse 2]
I  flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do now

Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love
Ooh tell me

Thinking about what it used to be

Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red

[Pre-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
Please, won't you push me for the last time
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you is no fucking fun
You want a martyr, I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done

You told me think about it, well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor

Will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up

You make me sick, I make it worse by drinking late

Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain

Blow the smoke in diamond shape
Dying is a gift so close your eyes
And rest in peace

Giving hope and making more chances

Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much

As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm
I'm just a regular kid, at my crib
Doin' regular shit, burnin' 5 spliffs
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'm a pour another cup and roll another zone
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me, hit me on Twitter
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name
Waitin' at the station till it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin bout
Pour a little liquor then I drink it down

[Hook]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone
Said it's just another night on my own

It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank god for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gate
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and
Burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do it's nothin' new

'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro

Say mr. whispers! Here come the click of dice
Roulette and blackjacks - gonna build us a paradise
Larger than life and twice as ugly

Maybe these luxuries can only compensate
For all the cards you were dealt at the hands of fate

So tell me
Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire
Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire!
Millionaire! Billionaire! Trillionaire!

Hardly surprising if you might consider
Loyalties go to the highest of bidders
What's my opinion? I'd give you ten to one
Give me a million, a franchise on fun
But there are millions who often get nowhere
And there's just one secret I think you should share

Maybe these luxuries can only compensate
For all the cards you were dealt at the hands of fate

So tell me
Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire
Tell me! tell me! How to be a millionaire!

But him and me, we pulled on through

I love real good, and I love you

And Americans love to watch it on TV
There's gays, lesbians, stripper nymphos
Teenage prostitutes, husbands gone psycho
The haters hate it 'cause it's too hot for TV
But America rules, nasty as we wanna be
Always #1 across the land
So don't hate Jerry 'cause he's the man!
With more fight time than HBO
And even Don King should promote talk shows
It't the best thing in years to hit the TV
'Cause America's rowdy-rowdy like Master P
Players everywhere love a good talk show
'Cause the hoochies get naked like a 2 Live show
So always represent the American way:
Freedom of speech and always gettin' paid!

The ghetto got me caught up in some talk show shhhhh
Now I'm on TV to find that my girl was a trick
She did my main man, plus my own band
I had to take a stand and beat the trick bad
Two sisters, that were doin' the two brothers
Now they fight 'cause they was doin' each other
The girl posin' nude used to be a dude
Outcasted from the family, now they startin' a feud
The man cheatin' on his wife got caught last night
'Cause the girl he was kissin' was a transvestite
Got caught on TV where it's too late to fight
Now the whole world knows about his secret life
50-year-old mom, dressed him like a hoochie
The hoodrat pulls a gat on the groupie
Too hot for TV, too much for the movies
Some lady smacked Jerry, say what? Sue me!

[Kid Ice] No matter how you feel, the stories are real
Showin' the world how Americans feel
With home-grown topics and a final thought
They even got hoochies without their bras
Of all the talk shows he's the best by far ...
{Instrumental where there should be a verse}
So set your VCR's if you got to go
'Cause you're living in America with the Springer show!
[Marquis] At the sound of the bell that goes Aw Hell!
Another knock down, another video sale
All problems solved, all matters scarred
A girl got knocked out her chair upside the wall
More hair-pullin', nail-bitin' and people fightin'
I love this show because it's so excitin'
The people believe what they really see
On tabloid TV, even me!

I believe I can get your diamonds

You'll leave it all to me and overnight
I'll arrive in a burst of light
Hold on, you can hold me tight
Don't worry, I'll get you out alive

Run so hard to get to you?
Would sell my soul to get me through? (Day by day)
It seems like all I ever do
Is run to you, run to you
Will you make me right?
Will it make me right?
Will you take this underdog
And put her on the side?

382,That's What Friends Are For,"[Verse 1: Dionne Warwick with Elton John]
And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you
And if I should ever go away
Well then, close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick with Elton John]
Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder & Elton John]
Well, you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so, by the way, I thank you
Oh, and then, for the times when we're apart
Well then, close your eyes and know
These words are comin' from my heart
And then if you can remember, oh

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
In good times, in bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
Oh, that's what friends are for, oh

[Chorus: Gladys Knight]
Oh, keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for

[Chorus: Elton John, Dionne Warwick, & all]
Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me, oh, for sure
'Cause I tell you that's what friends are for
For good times and for bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore, oh
That's what friends are for

It's too bad not to know
I don't know
I hurt you so
Baby, talk to me

I'm so sad
I can't wait
Baby, please don't hesitate
Baby, talk to me

[Hook:]
You never try to
Talk your feelings through
Communications start from me to you

We have to talk it through
To clear the air
We've got to talk to
Show the love we share

Baby talk
I know without a doubt

Baby, talk to me

We can see all this through
Talk will help love me and you
Baby, talk to me

It's hard to tell
When things start going wrong
We'll have to talk now
Before too long

So, honey, let's not throw our love away
Let's try to work it out
Before too late

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
You don't have to worry, baby
You don't have to fear
Tell me all the things you feel
And I will make you care

You just need to tell me, baby
What I need to say
I need to let you love me, baby
In that special way

You just need to tell me, baby
What I need to say
I need to let you love me, baby
In that special way

389,Le Bel Age (The Best Years),"                                      PLACE-NAMES: THE PLACE

MY FIRST VISIT TO BALBEC — FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF M. DE CHARLUS AND OF ROBERT DE SAINT-LOUP — DINNER WITH BLOCH AND HIS FAMILY

   I had arrived at a state almost of complete indifference to Gilberte when, two years later, I went with my grandmother to Balbec. When I succumbed to the attraction of a strange face, when it was with the help of some other girl that I hoped to discover gothic cathedrals, the palaces and gardens of Italy, I said to myself sadly that this love of ours, in so far as it is love for one particular creature, is not perhaps a very real thing, since if the association of pleasant or unpleasant trains of thought can attach it for a time to a woman so as to make us believe that it has been inspired by her, in a necessary sequence of effect to cause, yet when we detach ourselves, deliberately or unconsciously, from those associations, this love, as though it were indeed a spontaneous thing and sprang from ourselves alone, will revive in order to bestow itself on another woman. At the time, however, of my departure for Balbec, and during the earlier part of my stay there, my indifference was still only intermittent. Often, our life being so careless of chronology, interpolating so many anachronisms in the sequence of our days, I lived still among those — far older days than yesterday or last week — in which I loved Gilberte. And at once not seeing her became as exquisite a torture to me as it had been then. The self that had loved her, which another self had already almost entirely supplanted, rose again in me, stimulated far more often by a trivial than by an important event. For instance, if I may anticipate for a moment my arrival in Normandy, I heard some one who passed me on the sea-front at Balbec refer to the ‘Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and his family.’ Now, seeing that as yet I knew nothing of the influence which that family was to exercise over my life, this remark ought to have passed unheeded; instead, it gave me at once an acute twinge, which a self that had for the most part long since been outgrown in me felt at being parted from Gilberte. Because I had never given another thought to a conversation which Gilberte had had with her father in my hearing, in which allusion was made to the Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and to his family. Now our love memories present no exception to the general rules of memory, which in turn are governed by the still more general rules of Habit. And as Habit weakens every impression, what a person recalls to us most vividly is precisely what we had forgotten, because it was of no importance, and had therefore left in full possession of its strength. That is why the better part of our memory exists outside ourselves, in a blatter of rain, in the smell of an unaired room or of the first crackling brushwood fire in a cold grate: wherever, in short, we happen upon what our mind, having no use for it, had rejected, the last treasure that the past has in store, the richest, that which when all our flow of tears seems to have dried at the source can make us weep again. Outside ourselves, did I say; rather within ourselves, but hidden from our eyes in an oblivion more or less prolonged. It is thanks to this oblivion alone that we can from time to time recover the creature that we were, range ourselves face to face with past events as that creature had to face them, suffer afresh because we are no longer ourselves but he, and because he loved what leaves us now indifferent. In the broad daylight of our ordinary memory the images of the past turn gradually pale and fade out of sight, nothing remains of them, we shall never find them again. Or rather we should never find them again had not a few words (such as this ‘Secretary to the Ministry of Posts’) been carefully locked away in oblivion, just as an author deposits in the National Library a copy of a book which might otherwise become unobtainable

   But this suffering and this recrudescence of my love for Gilberte lasted no longer than such things last in a dream, and this time, on the contrary, because at Balbec the old Habit was no longer there to keep them alive. And if these two effects of Habit appear to be incompatible, that is because Habit is bound by a diversity of laws. In Paris I had grown more and more indifferent to Gilberte, thanks to Habit. The change of habit, that is to say the temporary cessation of Habit, completed Habit’s task when I started for Balbec. It weakens, but it stabilises; it leads to disintegration but it makes the scattered elements last indefinitely. Day after day, for years past, I had begun by modelling my state of mind, more or less effectively, upon that of the day before. At Balbec, a strange bed, to the side of which a tray was brought in the morning that differed from my Paris breakfast tray, could not, obviously, sustain the fancies upon which my love for Gilberte had fed: there are cases (though not, I admit, commonly) in which, one’s days being paralysed by a sedentary life, the best way to save time is to change one’s place of residence. My journey to Balbec was like the first outing of a convalescent who needed only that to convince him that he was cured

   The journey was one that would now be made, probably, in a motorcar, which would be supposed to render it more interesting. We shall see too that, accomplished in such a way, it would even be in a sense more genuine, since one would be following more nearly, in a closer intimacy, the various contours by which the surface of the earth is wrinkled. But after all the special attraction of the journey lies not in our being able to alight at places on the way and to stop altogether as soon as we grow tired, but in its making the difference between departure and arrival not as imperceptible but as intense as possible, so that we are conscious of it in its totality, intact, as it existed in our mind when imagination bore us from the place in which we were living right to the very heart of a place we longed to see, in a single sweep which seemed miraculous to us not so much because it covered a certain distance as because it united two distinct individualities of the world, took us from one name to another name; and this difference is accentuated (more than in a form of locomotion in which, since one can stop and alight where one chooses, there can scarcely be said to be any point of arrival) by the mysterious operation that is performed in those peculiar places, railway stations, which do not constitute, so to speak, a part of the surrounding town but contain the essence of its personality just as upon their sign-boards they bear its painted name

   But in this respect as in every other, our age is infected with a mania for shewing things only in the environment that properly belongs to them, thereby suppressing the essential thing, the act of the mind which isolated them from that environment. A picture is nowadays ‘presented’ in the midst of furniture, ornaments, hangings of the same period, a secondhand scheme of decoration in the composition of which in the houses of to-day excels that same hostess who but yesterday was so crassly ignorant, but now spends her time poring over records and in libraries; and among these the masterpiece at which we glance up from the table while we dine does not give us that exhilarating delight which we can expect from it only in a public gallery, which symbolises far better by its bareness, by the absence of all irritating detail, those innermost spaces into which the artist withdrew to create it

   Unhappily those marvellous places which are railway stations, from which one sets out for a remote destination, are tragic places also, for if in them the miracle is accomplished whereby scenes which hitherto have had no existence save in our minds are to become the scenes among which we shall be living, for that very reason we must, as we emerge from the waiting-room, abandon any thought of finding ourself once again within the familiar walls which, but a moment ago, were still enclosing us. We must lay aside all hope of going home to sleep in our own bed, once we have made up our mind to penetrate into the pestiferous cavern through which we may have access to the mystery, into one of those vast, glass-roofed sheds, like that of Saint-Lazare into which I must go to find the train for Balbec, and which extended over the rent bowels of the city one of those bleak and boundless skies, heavy with an accumulation of dramatic menaces, like certain skies painted with an almost Parisian modernity by Mantegna or Veronese, beneath which could be accomplished only some solemn and tremendous act, such as a departure by train or the Elevation of the Cross

   So long as I had been content to look out from the warmth of my own bed in Paris at the Persian church of Balbec, shrouded in driving sleet, no sort of objection to this journey had been offered by my body. Its objections began only when it had gathered that it would have itself to take part in the journey, and that on the evening of my arrival I should be shewn to ‘my’ room which to my body would be unknown. Its revolt was all the more deep-rooted in that on the very eve of my departure I learned that my mother would not be coming with us, my father, who would be kept busy at the Ministry until it was time for him to start for Spain with M. de Norpois, having preferred to take a house in the neighbourhood of Paris. On the other hand, the spectacle of Balbec seemed to me none the less desirable because I must purchase it at the price of a discomfort which, on the contrary, I felt to indicate and to guarantee the reality of the impression which I was going there to seek, an impression the place of which no spectacle of professedly equal value, no ‘panorama’ which I might have gone to see without being thereby precluded from returning home to sleep in my own bed, could possibly have filled. It was not for the first time that I felt that those who love and those who find pleasure are not always the same. I believed myself to be longing fully as much for Balbec as the doctor who was treating me, when he said to me, surprised, on the morning of our departure, to see me look so unhappy, “I don’t mind telling you that if I could only manage a week to go down and get a blow by the sea, I shouldn’t wait to be asked twice. You’ll be having races, regattas; you don’t know what all!” But I had already learned the lesson — long before I was taken to hear Berma — that, whatever it might be that I loved, it would never be attained save at the end of a long and heart-rending pursuit, in the course of which I should have first to sacrifice my own pleasure to that paramount good instead of seeking it there

   My grandmother, naturally enough, looked upon our exodus from a somewhat different point of view, and (for she was still as anxious as ever that the presents which were made me should take some artistic form) had planned, so that she might be offering me, of this journey, a ‘print’ that was, at least, in parts ‘old,’ that we should repeat, partly by rail and partly by road, the itinerary that Mme. de Sévigné followed when she went from Paris to ‘L’Orient’ by way of Chaulnes and ‘the Pont-Audemer.’ But my grandmother had been obliged to abandon this project, at the instance of my father who knew, whenever she organised any expedition with a view to extracting from it the utmost intellectual benefit that it was capable of yielding, what a tale there would be to tell of missed trains, lost luggage, sore throats and broken rules. She was free at least to rejoice in the thought that never, when the time came for us to sally forth to the beach, should we be exposed to the risk of being kept indoors by the sudden appearance of what her beloved Sévigné calls a ‘beast of a coachload,’ since we should know not a soul at Balbec, Legrandin having refrained from offering us a letter of introduction to his sister. (This abstention had not been so well appreciated by my aunts Céline and Flora, who, having known as a child that lady, of whom they had always spoken until then, to commemorate this early intimacy, as ‘Renée de Cambremer,’ and having had from her and still possessing a number of those little presents which continue to ornament a room or a conversation but to which the feeling between the parties no longer corresponds, imagined that they were avenging the insult offered to us by never uttering again, when they called upon Mme. Legrandin, the name of her daughter, confining themselves to a mutual congratulation, once they were safely out of the house: “I made no reference to you know whom!” “I think that went home!”)

   And so we were simply to leave Paris by that one twenty-two train which I had too often beguiled myself by looking out in the railway timetable, where its itinerary never failed to give me the emotion, almost the illusion of starting by it, not to feel that I already knew it. As the delineation in our mind of the features of any form of happiness depends more on the nature of the longings that it inspires in us than on the accuracy of the information which we have about it, I felt that I knew this train in all its details, nor did I doubt that I should feel, sitting in one of its compartments, a special delight as the day began to cool, should be contemplating this or that view as the train approached one or another station; so much so that this train, which always brought to my mind’s eye the images of the same towns, which I bathed in the sunlight of those post-meridian hours through which it sped, seemed to me to be different from every other train; and I had ended — as we are apt to do with a person whom we have never seen but of whom we like to believe that we have won his friendship — by giving a distinct and unalterable cast of countenance to the traveller, artistic, golden-haired, who would thus have taken me with him upon his journey, and to whom I should bid farewell beneath the Cathedral of Saint-Lo, before he hastened to overtake the setting sun

   As my grandmother could not bring herself to do anything so ‘stupid’ as to go straight to Balbec, she was to break the journey half-way, staying the night with one of her friends, from whose house I was to proceed the same evening, so as not to be in the way there and also in order that I might arrive by daylight and see Balbec Church, which, we had learned, was at some distance from Balbec-Plage, so that I might not have a chance to visit it later on, when I had begun my course of baths. And perhaps it was less painful for me to feel that the desirable goal of my journey stood between me and that cruel first night on which I should have to enter a new habitation, and consent to dwell there. But I had had first to leave the old; my mother had arranged to ‘move in,’ that afternoon, at Saint-Cloud, and had made, or pretended to make, all the arrangements for going there directly after she had seen us off at the station, without needing to call again at our own house to which she was afraid that I might otherwise feel impelled at the last moment, instead of going to Balbec, to return with her. In fact, on the pretext of having so much to see to in the house which she had just taken and of being pressed for time, but in reality so as to spare me the cruel ordeal of a long-drawn parting, she had decided not to wait with us until that moment of the signal to start at which, concealed hitherto among ineffective comings and goings and preparations that lead to nothing definite, separation is made suddenly manifest, impossible to endure when it is no longer possibly to be avoided, concentrated in its entirety in one enormous instant of impotent and supreme lucidity

   For the first time I began to feel that it was possible that my mother might live without me, otherwise than for me, a separate life. She was going to stay with my father, whose existence it may have seemed to her that my feeble health, my nervous excitability complicated somewhat and saddened. This separation made me all the more wretched because I told myself that it probably marked for my mother an end of the successive disappointments which I had caused her, of which she had never said a word to me but which had made her realise the difficulty of our taking our holidays together; and perhaps also the first trial of a form of existence to which she was beginning, now, to resign herself for the future, as the years crept on for my father and herself, an existence in which I should see less of her, in which (a thing that not even in my nightmares had yet been revealed to me) she would already have become something of a stranger, a lady who might be seen going home by herself to a house in which I should not be, asking the porter whether there was not a letter for her from me

   I could scarcely answer the man in the station who offered to take my bag. My mother, to comfort me, tried the methods which seemed to her most efficacious. Thinking it to be useless to appear not to notice my unhappiness, she gently teased me about it:

    “Well, and what would Balbec church say if it knew that people pulled long faces like that when they were going to see it? Surely this is not the enraptured tourist Ruskin speaks of. Besides, I shall know if you rise to the occasion, even when we are miles apart I shall still be with my little man. You shall have a letter to-morrow from Mamma.”

    “My dear,” said my grandmother, “I picture you like Mme. de Sévigné, your eyes glued to the map, and never losing sight of us for an instant.”

   Then Mamma sought to distract my mind, asked me what I thought of having for dinner, drew my attention to Françoise, complimented her on a hat and cloak which she did not recognise, in spite of their having horrified her long ago when she first saw them, new, upon my great-aunt, one with an immense bird towering over it, the other decorated with a hideous pattern and jet beads. But the cloak having grown too shabby to wear, Françoise had had it turned, exposing an ‘inside’ of plain cloth and quite a good colour. As for the bird, it had long since come to grief and been thrown away. And just as it is disturbing, sometimes, to find the effects which the most conscious artists attain only by an effort occurring in a folk-song, on the wall of some peasant’s cottage where above the door, at the precisely right spot in the composition, blooms a white or yellow rose — so the velvet band, the loop of ribbon which would have delighted one in a portrait by Chardin or Whistler, Françoise had set with a simple but unerring taste upon the hat, which was now charming

   To take a parallel from an earlier age, the modesty and integrity which often gave an air of nobility to the face of our old servant having spread also to the garments which, as a woman reserved but not humbled, who knew how to hold her own and to keep her place, she had put on for the journey so as to be fit to be seen in our company without at the same time seeming or wishing to make herself conspicuous — Françoise in the cherry-coloured cloth, now faded, of her cloak, and the discreet nap of her fur collar, brought to mind one of those miniatures of Anne of Brittany painted in Books of Hours by an old master, in which everything is so exactly in the right place, the sense of the whole is so evenly distributed throughout the parts that the rich and obsolete singularity of the costume expresses the same pious gravity as the eyes, lips and hands

   Of thought, in relation to Françoise, one could hardly speak. She knew nothing, in that absolute sense in which to know nothing means to understand nothing, save the rare truths to which the heart is capable of directly attaining. The vast world of ideas existed not for her. But when one studied the clearness of her gaze, the lines of nose and lips, all those signs lacking from so many people of culture in whom they would else have signified a supreme distinction, the noble detachment of a chosen spirit, one was disquieted, as one is by the frank, intelligent eyes of a dog, to which, nevertheless, one knows that all our human concepts must be alien, and was led to ask oneself whether there might not be, among those other humble brethren, our peasant countrymen, creatures who were, like the great ones of the earth, of simple mind, or rather, doomed by a harsh fate to live among the simple-minded, deprived of heavenly light, were yet more naturally, more instinctively akin to the chosen spirits than most educated people, were, so to speak, all members, though scattered, straying, robbed of their heritage of reason, of the celestial family, kinsfolk, that have been lost in infancy, of the loftiest minds to whom — as is apparent from the unmistakable light in their eyes, although they can concentrate that light on nothing — there has been lacking, to endow them with talent, knowledge only

   My mother, seeing that I had difficulty in keeping back my tears, said to me: “‘Regulus was in the habit, when things looked grave. . . . ’ Besides, it isn’t nice for Mamma! What does Mme. de Sévigné say? Your grandmother will tell you: ‘I shall be obliged to draw upon all the courage that you lack.’” And remembering that affection for another distracts one’s selfish griefs, she endeavoured to beguile me by telling me that she expected the removal to Saint-Cloud to go without a hitch, that she liked the cab, which she had kept waiting, that the driver seemed civil and the seats comfortable. I made an effort to smile at these trifles, and bowed my head with an air of acquiescence and satisfaction. But they helped me only to depict to myself with more accuracy Mamma’s imminent departure, and it was with an agonised heart that I gazed at her as though she were already torn from me, beneath that wide-brimmed straw hat which she had bought to wear in the country, in a flimsy dress which she had put on in view of the long drive through the sweltering midday heat; hat and dress making her some one else, some one who belonged already to the Villa Montretout, in which I should not see her

   To prevent the choking fits which the journey might otherwise give me the doctor had advised me to take, as we started, a good stiff dose of beer or brandy, so as to begin the journey in a state of what he called ‘euphoria,’ in which the nervous system is for a time less vulnerable. I had not yet made up my mind whether I should do this, but I wished at least that my grandmother should admit that, if I did so decide, I should have wisdom and authority on my side. I spoke therefore as if my hesitation were concerned only with where I should go for my drink, to the bar on the platform or to the restaurant-car on the train. But immediately, at the air of reproach which my grandmother’s face assumed, an air of not wishing even to entertain such an idea for a moment, “What!” I said to myself, suddenly determining upon this action of going out to drink, the performance of which became necessary as a proof of my independence since the verbal announcement of it had not succeeded in passing unchallenged, “What! You know how ill I am, you know what the doctor ordered, and you treat me like this!”

   When I had explained to my grandmother how unwell I felt, her distress, her kindness were so apparent as she replied, “Run along then, quickly; get yourself some beer or a liqueur if it will do you any good,” that I flung myself upon her, almost smothering her in kisses. And if after that I went and drank a great deal too much in the restaurant-car of the train, that was because I felt that otherwise I should have a more violent attack than usual, which was just what would vex her most. When at the first stop I clambered back into our compartment I told my grandmother how pleased I was to be going to Balbec, that I felt that everything would go off splendidly, that after all I should soon grow used to being without Mamma, that the train was most comfortable, the steward and attendants in the bar so friendly that I should like to make the journey often so as to have opportunities of seeing them again. My grandmother, however, did not appear to feel the same joy as myself at all these good tidings. She answered, without looking me in the face:

    “Why don’t you try to get a little sleep?” and turned her gaze to the window, the blind of which, though we had drawn it, did not completely cover the glass, so that the sun could and did slip in over the polished oak of the door and the cloth of the seat (like an advertisement of a life shared with nature far more persuasive than those posted higher upon the walls of the compartment, by the railway company, representing places in the country the names of which I could not make out from where I sat) the same warm and slumberous light which lies along a forest glade

   But when my grandmother thought that my eyes were shut I could see her, now and again, from among the large black spots on her veil, steal a glance at me, then withdraw it, and steal back again, like a person trying to make himself, so as to get into the habit, perform some exercise that hurts him

   Thereupon I spoke to her, but that seemed not to please her either. And yet to myself the sound of my own voice was pleasant, as were the most imperceptible, the most internal movements of my body. And so I endeavoured to prolong it. I allowed each of my inflexions to hang lazily upon its word, I felt each glance from my eyes arrive just at the spot to which it was directed and stay there beyond the normal period. “Now, now, sit still and rest,” said my grandmother. “If you can’t manage to sleep, read something.” And she handed me a volume of Madame de Sévigné which I opened, while she buried herself in the Mémoires de Madame de Beausergent. She never travelled anywhere without a volume of each. They were her two favourite authors. With no conscious movement of my head, feeling a keen pleasure in maintaining a posture after I had adopted it, I lay back holding in my hands the volume of Madame de Sévigné which I had allowed to close, without lowering my eyes to it, or indeed letting them see anything but the blue window-blind. But the contemplation of this blind appeared to me an admirable thing, and I should not have troubled to answer anyone who might have sought to distract me from contemplating it. The blue colour of this blind seemed to me, not perhaps by its beauty but by its intense vivacity, to efface so completely all the colours that had passed before my eyes from the day of my birth up to the moment in which I had gulped down the last of my drink and it had begun to take effect, that when compared with this blue they were as drab, as void as must be retrospectively the darkness in which he has lived to a man born blind whom a subsequent operation has at length enabled to see and to distinguish colours. An old ticket-collector came to ask for our tickets. The silvery gleam that shone from the metal buttons of his jacket charmed me in spite of my absorption. I wanted to ask him to sit down beside us. But he passed on to the next carriage, and I thought with longing of the life led by railwaymen for whom, since they spent all their time on the line, hardly a day could pass without their seeing this’ old collector. The pleasure that I found in staring at the blind, and in feeling that my mouth was half-open, began at length to diminish. I became more mobile; I even moved in my seat; I opened the book that my grandmother had given me and turned its pages casually, reading whatever caught my eye. And as I read I felt my admiration for Madame de Sévigné grow

   It is a mistake to let oneself be taken in by the purely formal details, idioms of the period or social conventions, the effect of which is that certain people believe that they have caught the Sévigné manner when they have said: “Tell me, my dear,” or “That Count struck me as being a man of parts,” or “Haymaking is the sweetest thing in the world.” Mme. de Simiane imagines already that she is being like her grandmother because she can write: “M. de la Boulie is bearing wonderfully, Sir, and is in excellent condition to hear the news of his death,” or “Oh, my dear Marquis, how your letter enchanted me! What can I do but answer it?” or “Meseems, Sir, that you owe me a letter, and I owe you some boxes of bergamot. I discharge my debt to the number of eight; others shall follow. . . . Never has the soil borne so many. Apparently for your gratification.” And she writes in this style also her letter on bleeding, on lemons and so forth, supposing it to be typical of the letters of Madame de Sévigné. But my grandmother who had approached that lady from within, attracted to her by her own love of kinsfolk and of nature, had taught me to enjoy the real beauties of her correspondence, which are altogether different. They were presently to strike me all the more forcibly inasmuch as Madame de Sévigné is a great artist of the same school as a painter whom I was to meet at Balbec, where his influence on my way of seeing things was immense. I realised at Balbec that it was in the same way as he that she presented things to her readers, in the order of our perception of them, instead of first having to explain them in relation to their several causes. But already that afternoon in the railway carriage, as I read over again that letter in which the moonlight comes: “I cannot resist the temptation: I put on all my bonnets and veils, though there is no need of them, I walk along this mall, where the air is as sweet as in my chamber; I find a thousand phantasms, monks white and black, sisters grey and white, linen cast here and there on the ground, men enshrouded upright against the tree-trunks,” I was enraptured by what, a little later, I should have described (for does not she draw landscapes in the same way as he draws characters?) as the Dostoievsky side of Madame de Sévigné‘s Letters

   When, that evening, after having accompanied my grandmother to her destination and spent some hours in her friend’s house, I had returned by myself to the train, at any rate I found nothing to distress me in the night which followed; this was because I had not to spend it in a room the somnolence of which would have kept me awake; I was surrounded by the soothing activity of all those movements of the train which kept me company, offered to stay and converse with me if I could not sleep, lulled me with their sounds which I wedded — as I had often wedded the chime of the Combray bells — now to one rhythm, now to another (hearing as the whim took me first four level and equivalent semi-quavers, then one semi-quaver furiously dashing against a crotchet); they neutralised the centrifugal force of my insomnia by exercising upon it a contrary pressure which kept me in equilibrium and on which my immobility and presently my drowsiness felt themselves to be borne with the same sense of refreshment that I should have had, had I been resting under the protecting vigilance of powerful forces, on the breast of nature and of life, had I been able for a moment to incarnate myself in a fish that sleeps in the sea, driven unheeding by the currents and the tides, or in an eagle outstretched upon the air, with no support but the storm

   Sunrise is a necessary concomitant of long railway journeys, just as are hard-boiled eggs, illustrated papers, packs of cards, rivers upon which boats strain but make no progress. At a certain moment — when I was counting over the thoughts that had filled my mind, in the preceding minutes, so as to discover whether I had just been asleep or not (and when the very uncertainty which made me ask myself the question was to furnish me with an affirmative answer), in the pale square of the window, over a small black wood I saw some ragged clouds whose fleecy edges were of a fixed, dead pink, not liable to change, like the colour that dyes the wing which has grown to wear it, or the sketch upon which the artist’s fancy has washed it. But I felt that, unlike them, this colour was due neither to inertia nor to caprice but to necessity and life. Presently there gathered behind it reserves of light. It brightened; the sky turned to a crimson which I strove, gluing my eyes to the window, to see more clearly, for I felt that it was related somehow to the most intimate life of Nature, but, the course of the line altering, the train turned, the morning scene gave place in the frame of the window to a nocturnal village, its roofs still blue with moonlight, its pond encrusted with the opalescent nacre of night, beneath a firmament still powdered with all its stars, and I was lamenting the loss of my strip of pink sky when I caught sight of it afresh, but red this time, in the opposite window which it left at a second bend in the line, so that I spent my time running from one window to the other to reassemble, to collect oh a single canvas the intermittent, antipodean fragments of my fine, scarlet, ever-changing morning, and to obtain a comprehensive view of it and a continuous picture

   The scenery became broken, abrupt, the train stopped at a little station between two mountains. Far down the gorge, on the edge of a hurrying Stream, one could see only a solitary watch-house, deep-planted in the water which ran past on a level with its windows. If a person can be the product of a soil the peculiar charm of which one distinguishes in that person, more even than the peasant girl whom I had so desperately longed to see appear when I wandered by myself along the Méséglise way, in the woods of Roussainville, such a person must be the big girl whom I now saw emerge from the house and, climbing a path lighted by the first slanting rays of the sun, come towards the station carrying a jar of milk. In her valley from which its congregated summits hid the rest of the world, she could never see anyone save in these trains which stopped for a moment only. She passed down the line of windows, offering coffee and milk to a few awakened passengers. Purpled with the glow of morning, her face was rosier than the sky. I felt in her presence that desire to live which is reborn in us whenever we become conscious anew of beauty and of happiness. We invariably forget that these are individual qualities, and, substituting for them in our mind a conventional type at which we arrive by striking a sort of mean amongst the different faces that have taken our fancy, the pleasures we have known, we are left with mere abstract images which are lifeless and dull because they are lacking in precisely that element of novelty, different from anything we have known, that element which is proper to beauty and to happiness. And we deliver on life a pessimistic judgment which we suppose to be fair, for we believed that we were taking into account when we formed it happiness and beauty, whereas in fact we left them out and replaced them by syntheses in which there is not a single atom of either. So it is that a well-read man will at once begin to yawn with boredom when anyone speaks to him of a new ‘good book,’ because he imagines a sort of composite of all the good books that he has read and knows already, whereas a good book is something special, something incalculable, and is made up not of the sum of all previous masterpieces but of something which the most thorough assimilation of every one of them would not enable him to discover, since it exists not in their sum but beyond it. Once he has become acquainted with this new work, the well-read man, till then apathetic, feels his interest awaken in the reality which it depicts. So, alien to the models of beauty which my fancy was won't to sketch when I was by myself, this strapping girl gave me at once the sensation of a certain happiness (the sole form, always different, in which we may learn the sensation of happiness), of a happiness that would be realised by my staying and living there by her side. But in this again the temporary cessation of Habit played a great part. I was giving the milk-girl the benefit of what was really my own entire being, ready to taste the keenest joys, which now confronted her. As a rule it is with our being reduced to a minimum that we live, most of our faculties lie dormant because they can rely upon Habit, which knows what there is to be done and has no need of their services. But on this morning of travel, the interruption of the routine of my existence, the change of place and time, had made their presence indispensable. My habits, which were sedentary and not matutinal, played me false, and all my faculties came hurrying to take their place, vying with one another in their zeal, rising, each of them, like waves in a storm, to the same unaccustomed level, from the basest to the most exalted, from breath, appetite, the circulation of my blood to receptivity and imagination. I cannot say whether, so as to make me believe that this girl was unlike the rest of women, the rugged charm of these barren tracts had been added to her own, but if so she gave it back to them. Life would have seemed an exquisite thing to me if only I had been free to spend it, hour after hour, with her, to go with her to the stream, to the cow, to the train, to be always at her side, to feel that I was known to her, had my place in her thoughts. She would have initiated me into the delights of country life and of the first hours of the day. I signalled to her to give me some of her coffee. I felt that I must be noticed by her. She did not see me; I called to her. Above her body, which was of massive build, the complexion of her face was so burnished and so ruddy that she appeared almost as though I were looking at her through a lighted window. She had turned and was coming towards me; I could not take my eyes from her face which grew larger as she approached, like a sun which it was somehow possible to arrest in its course and draw towards one, letting itself be seen at close quarters, blinding the eyes with its blaze of red and gold. She fastened on me her penetrating stare, but while the porters ran along the platform shutting doors the train had begun to move. I saw her leave the station and go down the hill to her home; it was broad daylight now; I was speeding away from the dawn. Whether my exaltation had been produced by this girl or had on the other hand been responsible for most of the pleasure that I had found in the sight of her, in the sense of her presence, in either event she was so closely associated with it that my desire to see her again was really not so much a physical as a mental desire, not to allow this state of enthusiasm to perish utterly, not to be separated for ever from the person who, although quite unconsciously, had participated in it. It was not only because this state was a pleasant one. It was principally because (just as increased tension upon a cord or accelerated vibration of a nerve produces a different sound or colour) it gave another tonality to all that I saw, introduced me as an actor upon the stage of an unknown and infinitely more interesting universe; that handsome girl whom I still could see, while the train gathered speed, was like part of a life other than the life that I knew, separated from it by a clear boundary, in which the sensations that things produced in me were no longer the same, from which to return now to my old life would be almost suicide. To procure myself the pleasure of feeling that I had at least an attachment to this new life, it would suffice that I should live near enough to the little station to be able to come to it every morning for a cup of coffee from the girl. But alas, she must be for ever absent from the other life towards which I was being borne with ever increasing swiftness, a life to the prospect of which I resigned myself only by weaving plans that would enable me to take the same train again some day and to stop at the same station, a project which would have the further advantage of providing with subject matter the selfish, active, practical, mechanical, indolent, centrifugal tendency which is that of the human mind; for our mind turns readily aside from the effort which is required if it is to analyse in itself, in a general and disinterested manner, a pleasant impression which we have received. And as, on the other hand, we wish to continue to think of that impression, the mind prefers to imagine it in the future tense, which while it gives us no clue as to the real nature of the thing, saves us the trouble of recreating it in our own consciousness and allows us to hope that we may receive it afresh from without

   Certain names of towns, Vezelay or Chartres, Bourses or Beauvais, serve to indicate, by abbreviation, the principal church in those towns. This partial acceptation, in which we are so accustomed to take the word, comes at length — if the names in question are those of places that we do not yet know — to fashion for us a mould of the name as a solid whole, which from that time onwards, whenever we wish it to convey the idea of the town — of that town which we have never seen — will impose on it, as on a cast, the same carved outlines, in the same style of art, will make of the town a sort of vast cathedral. It was, nevertheless, in a railway-station, above the door of a refreshment-room, that I read the name — almost Persian in style — of Balbec. I strode buoyantly through the station and across the avenue that led past it, I asked my way to the beach so as to see nothing in the place but its church and the sea; people seemed not to understand what I meant. Old Balbec, Balbec-en-Terre, at which I had arrived, had neither beach nor harbour. It was, most certainly, in the sea that the fishermen had found, according to the legend, the miraculous Christ, of which a window in the church that stood a few yards from where I now was recorded the discovery; it was indeed from cliffs battered by the waves that had been quarried the stone of its navfc and towers. But this sea, which for those reasons I had imagined as flowing up to die at the foot of the window, was twelve miles away and more, at Balbec-Plage, and, rising beside its cupola, that steeple, which, because I had read that it was itself a rugged Norman cliff on which seeds were blown and sprouted, round which the sea-birds wheeled, I had always pictured to myself as receiving at its base the last drying foam of the uplifted waves, stood on a Square from which two lines of tramway diverged, opposite a Café which bore, written in letters of gold, the word ‘Billiards’; it stood out against a background of houses with the roofs of which no upstanding mast was blended. And the church — entering my mind with the Café, with the passing stranger of whom I had had to ask my way, with the station to which presently I should have to return — made part of the general whole, seemed an accident, a by-product of this summer afternoon, in which its mellow and distended dome against the sky was like a fruit of which the same light that bathed the chimneys of the houses was ripening the skin, pink, glowing, melting-soft. But I wished only to consider the eternal significance of the carvings when I recognised the Apostles, which I had seen in casts in the Trocadéro museum, and which on either side of the Virgin, before the deep bay of the porch, were awaiting me as though to do me reverence. With their benign, blunt, mild faces and bowed shoulders they seemed to be advancing upon me with an air of welcome, singing the Alleluia of a fine day. But it was evident that their expression was unchanging as that on a dead man’s face, and could be modified only by my turning about to look at them in different aspects. I said to myself: “Here I am: this is the Church of Balbec. This square, which looks as though it were conscious of its glory, is the only place in the world that possesses Balbec Church. All that I have seen so far have been photographs of this church — and of these famous Apostles, this Virgin of the Porch, mere casts only. Now it is the church itself, the statue itself; these are they; they, the unique things — this is something far greater.”

   It was something less, perhaps, also. As a young man on the day of an examination or of a duel feels the question that he has been asked, the shot that he has fired, to be a very little thing when he thinks of the reserves of knowledge and of valour that he possesses and would like to have displayed, so my mind, which had exalted the Virgin of the Porch far above the reproductions that I had had before my eyes, inaccessible by the vicissitudes which had power to threaten them, intact although they were destroyed, ideal, endowed with universal value, was astonished to see the statue which it had carved a thousand times, reduced now to its own apparent form in stone, occupying, on the radius of my outstretched arm, a place in which it had for rivals an election placard and the point of my stick, fettered to the Square, inseparable from the head of the main street, powerless to hide from the gaze of the Café and of the omnibus office, receiving on its face half of that ray of the setting sun (half, presently, in a few hours’ time, of the light of the street lamp) of which the Bank building received the other half, tainted simultaneously with that branch office of a money-lending establishment by the smells from the pastry-cook’s oven, subjected to the tyranny of the Individual to such a point that, if I had chosen to scribble my name upon that stone, it was she, the illustrious Virgin whom until then I had endowed with a general existence and an intangible beauty, the Virgin of Balbec, the unique (which meant, alas, the only one) who, on her body coated with the same soot as defiled the neighbouring houses, would have displayed — powerless to rid herself of them — to all the admiring strangers come there to gaze upon her, the marks of my piece of chalk and the letters of my name; it was she, indeed, the immortal work of art, so long desired, whom I found, transformed, as was the church itself, into a little old woman in stone whose height I could measure and count her wrinkles. But time was passing; I must return to the station, where I was to wait for my grandmother and Françoise, so that we should all arrive at Balbec-Plage together. I reminded myself of what I had read about Balbec, of Swann’s saying: “It is exquisite; as fine as Siena.” And casting the blame for my disappointment upon various accidental causes, such as the state of my health, my exhaustion after the journey, my incapacity for looking at things properly, I endeavoured to console myself with the thought that other towns remained still intact for me, that I might soon, perhaps, be making my way, as into a shower of pearls, into the cool pattering sound that dripped from Quimperlé, cross that green water lit by a rosy glow in which Pont-Aven was bathed; but as for Balbec, no sooner had I set foot in it than it was as though I had broken open a name which ought to have been kept hermetically closed, and into which, seizing at once the opportunity that I had imprudently given them when I expelled all the images that had been living in it until then, a tramway, a Café, people crossing the square, the local branch of a Bank, irresistibly propelled by some external pressure, by a pneumatic force, had come crowding into the interior of those two syllables which, closing over them, let them now serve as a border to the porch of the Persian church, and would never henceforward cease to contain them

   In the little train of the local railway company which was to take us to Balbec-Plage I found my grandmother, but found her alone — for, imagining that she was sending Françoise on ahead of her, so as to have everything ready before we arrived, but having mixed up her instructions, she had succeeded only in packing off Françoise in the wrong direction, who at that moment was being carried down all unsuspectingly, at full speed, to Nantes, and would probably wake up next morning at Bordeaux. No sooner had I taken my seat in the carriage, filled with the fleeting light of sunset and with the lingering heat of the afternoon (the former enabling me, alas, to see written clearly upon my grandmother’s face how much the latter had tired her), than she began: “Well, and Balbec?” with a smile so brightly illuminated by her expectation of the great pleasure which she supposed me to have been enjoying that I dared not at once confess to her my disappointment. Besides, the impression which my mind had been seeking occupied it steadily less as the place drew nearer to which my body would have to become accustomed. At the end — still more than an hour away — of this journey I was trying to form a picture of the manager of the hotel at Balbec, to whom I, at that moment, did not exist, and I should have liked to be going to present myself to him in more impressive company than that of my grandmother, who would be certain to ask for a reduction of his terms. The only thing positive about him was his haughty condescension; his lineaments were still vague

   Every few minutes the little train brought us to a standstill in one of the stations which came before Balbec-Plage, stations the mere names of which (Incarville, Marcouville, Doville, Pont-a-Couleuvre, Arambouville, Saint-Mars-le-Vieux, Hermonville, Maineville) seemed to me outlandish, whereas if I had come upon them in a book I should at once have been struck by their affinity to the names of certain places in the neighbourhood of Combray. But to the trained ear two musical airs, consisting each of so many notes, several of which are common to them both, will present no similarity whatever if they differ in the colour of their harmony and orchestration. So it was that nothing could have reminded me less than these dreary names, made up of sand, of space too airy and empty and of salt, out of which the termination ‘ville’ always escaped, as the ‘fly’ seems to spring out from the end of the word ‘butterfly’— nothing could have reminded me less of those other names, Roussainville or Martinville, which, because I had heard them pronounced so often by my great-aunt at table, in the dining-room, had acquired a certain sombre charm in which were blended perhaps extracts of the flavour of ‘preserves,’ the smell of the fire of logs and of the pages of one of Bergotte’s books, the colour of the stony front of the house opposite, all of which things still to-day when they rise like a gaseous bubble from the depths of my memory preserve their own specific virtue through all the successive layers of rival interests which must be traversed before they reach the surface

   These were — commanding the distant sea from the crests of their several dunes or folding themselves already for the night beneath hills of a crude green colour and uncomfortable shape, like that of the sofa in one’s bedroom in an hotel at which one has just arrived, each composed of a cluster of villas whose line was extended to include a lawn-tennis court and now and then a casino, over which a flag would be snapping in the freshening breeze, like a hollow cough — a series of watering-places which now let me see for the first time their regular visitors, but let me see only the external features of those visitors — lawn-tennis players in white hats, the station-master spending all his life there on the spot among his tamarisks and roses, a lady in a straw ‘boater’ who, following the everyday routine of an existence which I should never know, was calling to her dog which had stopped to examine something in the road before going in to her bungalow where the lamp was already lighted for her return — which with these strangely usual and slightingly familiar sights stung my un-greeted eyes and stabbed my exiled heart. But how much were my sufferings increased when we had finally landed in the hall of the Grand Hotel at Balbec, and I stood there in front of the monumental staircase that looked like marble, while my grandmother, regardless of the growing hostility of the strangers among whom we should have to live, discussed ‘terms’ with the manager, a sort of nodding mandarin whose face and voice were alike covered with scars (left by the excision of countless pustules from one and from the other of the divers accents acquired from an alien ancestry and in a cosmopolitan upbringing) who stood there in a smart dinner-jacket, with the air of an expert psychologist, classifying, whenever the ‘omnibus’ discharged a fresh load, the ‘nobility and gentry’ as ‘geesers’ and the ‘hotel crooks’ as nobility and gentry. Forgetting, probably, that he himself was not drawing five hundred francs a month, he had a profound contempt for people to whom five hundred francs — or, as he preferred ta put it,‘twenty-five louis’ was ‘a lot of money,’ and regarded them as belonging to a race of pariahs for whom the Grand Hotel was certainly not intended. It is true that even within its walls there were people who did not pay very much and yet had not forfeited the manager’s esteem, provided that he was assured that they were watching their expenditure not from poverty so much as from avarice. For this could in no way lower their standing since it is a vice and may consequently be found at every grade of social position. Social position was the one thing by which the manager was impressed, social position, or rather the signs which seemed to him to imply that it was exalted, such as not taking one’s hat off when one came into the hall, wearing knickerbockers, or an overcoat with a waist, and taking a cigar with a band of purple and gold out of a crushed morocco case — to none of which advantages could I, alas, lay claim. He would also adorn his business conversation with choice expressions, to which, as a rule, he gave a wrong meaning

   While I heard my grandmother, who shewed no sign of annoyance at his listening to her with his hat on his head and whistling through his teeth at her, ask him in an artificial voice, “And what are . . . your charges? . . . Oh! far too high for my little budget,” waiting upon a bench, I sought refuge in the innermost depths of my own consciousness, strove to migrate to a plane of eternal thoughts — to leave nothing of myself, nothing that lived and felt on the surface of my body, anaesthetised as are those of animals which by inhibition feign death when they are attacked — so as not to suffer too keenly in this place, with which my total unfamiliarity was made all the more evident to me when I saw the familiarity that seemed at the same moment to be enjoyed by a smartly dressed lady for whom the manager shewed his respect by taking liberties with the little dog that followed her across the hall, the young ‘blood’ with a feather in his hat who asked, as he came in, ‘Any letters?’— all these people to whom it was an act of home-coming to mount those stairs of imitation marble. And at the same time the triple frown of Minos, ^Eacus and Rhadamanthus (beneath which I plunged my naked soul as into an unknown element where there was nothing now to protect it) was bent sternly upon me by a group of gentlemen who, though little versed perhaps in the art of receiving, yet bore the title ‘Reception Clerks,’ while beyond them again, through a closed wall of glass, were people sitting in a reading-room for the description of which I should have had to borrow from Dante alternately the colours in which he paints Paradise and Hell, according as I was thinking of the happiness of the elect who had the right to sit and read there undisturbed, or of the terror which my grandmother would have inspired in me if, in her insensibility to this sort of impression, she had asked me to go in there and wait for her by myself

   My sense of loneliness was further increased a moment later: when I had confessed to my grandmother that I did not feel well, that I thought that we should be obliged to return to Paris, she had offered no protest, saying merely that she was going out to buy a few things which would be equally useful whether we left or stayed (and which, I afterwards learned, were all for my benefit, Françoise having gone off with certain articles which I might need); while I waited for her I had taken a turn through the streets, packed with a crowd of people who imparted to them a sort of indoor warmth, streets in which were still open the hairdresser’s shop and the pastry-cook’s, the latter filled with customers eating ices, opposite the statue of Duguay-Trouin. This crowd gave me just about as much pleasure as a photograph of it in one of the ‘illustrateds’ might give a patient who was turning its pages in the surgeon’s waiting-room. I was astonished to find that there were people so different from myself that this stroll through the town had actually been recommended to me by the manager as a distraction, and also that the torture chamber which a new place of residence is could appear to some people a ‘continuous amusement,’ to quote the hotel prospectus, which might, it was true, exaggerate, but was, for all that, addressed to a whole army of clients to whose tastes it must appeal. True, it invoked, to make them come to the Grand Hotel, Balbec, not only the ‘exquisite fare’ and the ‘fairy-like view across the Casino gardens,’ but also the ‘ordinances of her Majesty Queen Fashion, which no one may break with impunity, or without being taken for a Boeotian, a charge that no well-bred man would willingly incur.’ The need that I now had of my grandmother was enhanced by my fear that I had shattered another of her illusions. She must be feeling discouraged, feeling that if I could not stand the fatigue of this journey there was no hope that any change of air could ever do me good. I decided to return to the hotel and to wait for her there: the manager himself came forward and pressed a button, and a person whose acquaintance I had not yet made, labelled ‘LIFT’ (who at that highest point in the building, which corresponded to the lantern in a Norman church, was installed like a photographer in his darkroom or an organist in his loft) came rushing down towards me with the agility of a squirrel, tamed, active, caged. Then, sliding upwards again along a steel pillar, he bore me aloft in his train towards the dome of this temple of Mammon. On each floor, on either side of a narrow communicating stair, opened out fanwise a range of shadowy galleries, along one of which, carrying a bolster, a chambermaid came past. I lent to her face, which the gathering dusk made featureless, the mask of my most impassioned dreams of beauty, but read in her eyes as they turned towards me the horror of my own nonentity. Meanwhile, to dissipate, in the course of this interminable assent, the mortal anguish which I felt in penetrating thus in silence the mystery of this chiaroscuro so devoid of poetry, lighted by a single vertical line of little windows which were those of the solitary water-closet on each landing, I addressed a few words to the young organist, artificer of my journey and my partner in captivity, who continued to manipulate the registers of his instrument and to finger the stops. I apologised for taking up so much room, for giving him so much trouble, and asked whether I was not obstructing him in the practice of an art to which, so as to flatter the performer, I did more than display curiosity, I confessed my strong attachment. But he vouchsafed no answer, whether from astonishment at my words, preoccupation with what he was doing, regard for convention, hardness of hearing, respect for holy ground, fear of danger, slowness of understanding, or by the manager’s orders

   There is perhaps nothing that gives us so strong an impression of the reality of the external world as the difference in the positions, relative to ourselves, of even a quite unimportant person before we have met him and after. I was the same man who had taken, that afternoon, the little train from Balbec to the coast, I carried in my body the same consciousness But on that consciousness, in the place where, at six o’clock, there had been, with the impossibility of forming any idea of the manager, the Grand Hotel or its occupants, a vague and timorous impatience for the moment at which I should reach my destination, were to be found now the pustules excised from the face of the cosmopolitan manager (he was, as a matter of fact, a naturalised Monégasque, although — as he himself put it, for he was always using expressions which he thought distinguished without noticing that they were incorrect —‘of Rumanian originality’), his action in ringing for the lift, the lift-boy himself, a whole frieze of puppet-show characters issuing from that Pandora’s box which was the Grand Hotel, undeniable, irremovable, and, like everything that is realised, sterilising. But at least this change, which I had done nothing to bring about, proved to me that something had happened which was external to myself — however devoid of interest that thing might be — and I was like a traveller who, having had the sun in his face when he started, concludes that he has been for so many hours on the road when he finds the sun behind him. I was half dead with exhaustion, I was burning with fever; I would gladly have gone to bed, but I had no night-things. I should have liked at least to lie down for a little while on the bed, but what good would that have done me, seeing that I should not have been able to find any rest there for that mass of sensations which is for each of us his sentient if not his material body, and that the unfamiliar objects which encircled that body, forcing it to set its perceptions on the permanent footing of a vigilant and defensive guard, would have kept my sight, my hearing, all my senses in a position as cramped and comfortless (even if I had stretched out my legs) as that of Cardinal La Balue in the cage in which he could neither stand nor sit. It is our noticing them that puts things in a room, our growing used to them that takes them away again and clears a space for us. Space there was none for me in my bedroom (mine in name only) at Balbec; it was full of things which did not know me, which flung back at me the distrustful look that I had cast at them, and, without taking any heed of my existence, shewed that I was interrupting the course of theirs. The clock — whereas at home I heard my clock tick only a few seconds in a week, when I was coming out of some profound meditation — continued without a moment’s interruption to utter, in an unknown tongue, a series of observations which must have been most uncomplimentary to myself, for the violet curtains listened to them without replying, but in an attitude such as people adopt who shrug their shoulders to indicate that the sight of a third person irritates them. They gave to this room with its lofty ceiling a semi-historical character which might have made it a suitable place for the assassination of the Duc de Guise, and afterwards for parties of tourists personally conducted by one of Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son’s guides, but for me to sleep in — no. I was tormented by the presence of some little bookcases with glass fronts which ran along the walls, but especially by a large mirror with feet which stood across one corner, for I felt that until it had left the room there would be no possibility of rest for me there. I kept raising my eyes — which the things in my room in Paris disturbed no more than did my eyelids themselves, for they were merely extensions of my organs, an enlargement of myself — towards the fantastically high ceiling of this belvedere planted upon the summit of the hotel which my grandmother had chosen for me; and in that region more intimate than those in which we see and hear, that region in which we test the quality of odours, almost in the very heart of my inmost self, the smell of flowering grasses next launched its offensive against my last feeble line of trenches, where I stood up to it, not without tiring myself still further, with the futile incessant defence of an anxious sniffing. Having no world, no room, no body now that was not menaced by the enemies thronging round me, invaded to the very bones by fever, I was utterly alone; I longed to die. Then my grandmother came in, and to the expansion of my ebbing heart there opened at once an infinity of space

   She was wearing a loose cambric gown which she put on at home whenever any of us was ill (because she felt more comfortable in it, she used to say, for she always ascribed to her actions a selfish motive), and which was, for tending us, for watching by our beds, her servant’s livery, her nurse’s uniform, her religious habit. But whereas the trouble that servants, nurses, religious take, their kindness to us, the merits that we discover in them and the gratitude that we owe them all go to increase the impression that we have of being, in their eyes, some one different, of feeling that we are alone, keeping in our own hands the control over our thoughts, our will to live, I knew, when I was with my grandmother, that, however great the misery that there was in me, it would be received by her with a pity still more vast; that everything that was mine, my cares, my wishes, would be, in my grandmother, supported upon a desire to save and prolong my life stronger than was my own; and my thoughts were continued in her without having to undergo any deflection, since they passed from my mind into hers without change of atmosphere or of personality. And — like a man who tries to fasten his necktie in front of a glass and forgets that the end which he sees reflected is not on the side to which he raises his hand, or like a dog that chases along the ground the dancing shadow of an insect in the air — misled by her appearance in the body as we are apt to be in this world where we have no direct perception of people’s souls, I threw myself into the arms of my grandmother and clung with my lips to her face as though I had access thus to that immense heart which she opened to me. And when I felt my mouth glued to her cheeks, to her brow, I drew from them something so beneficial, so nourishing that I lay in her arms as motionless, as solemn, as calmly gluttonous as a babe at the breast

   At last I let go, and lay and gazed, and could not tire of gazing at her large face, as clear in its outline as a fine cloud, glowing and serene, behind which I could discern the radiance of her tender love. And everything that received, in however slight a degree, any share of her sensations, everything that could be said to belong in any way to her was at once so spiritualised, so sanctified, that with outstretched hands I smoothed her dear hair, still hardly grey, with as much respect, precaution, comfort as if I had actually been touching her goodness. She found a similar pleasure in taking any trouble that saved me one, and in a moment of immobility and rest for my weary limbs something so delicious that when, having seen that she wished to help me with my undressing and to take my boots off, I made as though to stop her and began to undress myself, with an imploring gaze she arrested my hands as they fumbled with the top buttons of my coat and boots

    “Oh, do let me!” she begged. “It is such a joy for your Granny. And be sure you knock on the wall if you want anything in the night. My bed is just on the other side, and the partition is, quite thin. Just give a knock now, as soon as you are ready, so that we shall know where we are.”

   And, sure enough, that evening I gave three knocks — a signal which, the week after, when I was ill, I repeated every morning for several days, because my grandmother wanted me to have some milk early. Then, when I thought that I could hear her stirring, so that she should not be kept waiting but might, the moment she had brought me the milk, go to sleep again, I ventured on three little taps, timidly, faintly, but for all that distinctly, for if I was afraid of disturbing her, supposing that I had been mistaken and that she was still asleep, I should not have wished her either to lie awake listening for a summons which she had not at once caught and which I should not have the courage to repeat. And scarcely had I given my taps than I heard three others, in a different intonation from mine, stamped with a calm authority, repeated twice over so that there should be no mistake, and saying to me plainly: “Don’t get excited; I heard you; I shall be with you in a minute!” and shortly afterwards my grandmother appeared. I explained to her that I had been afraid that she would not hear me, or might think that it was some one in the room beyond who was lapping; at which she smiled:

    “Mistake my poor chick’s knocking for anyone else! Why, Granny could tell it among a thousand! Do you suppose there’s anyone else in the world who’s such a silly-billy, with such feverish little knuckles, so afraid of waking me up and of not making me understand? Even if he just gave the least scratch, Granny could tell her mouse’s sound at once, especially such a poor miserable little mouse as mine is. I could hear it just now, trying to make up its mind, and rustling the bedclothes, and going through all its tricks.”

   She pushed open the shutters; where a wing of the hotel jutted out at right angles to my window, the sun was already installed upon the roof, like a slater who is up betimes, and starts early and works quietly so as not to rouse the sleeping town, whose stillness seems to enhance his activity. She told me what o’clock, what sort of day it was; that it was not worth while my getting up and coming to the window, that there was a mist over the sea; if the baker’s shop had opened yet; what the vehicle was that I could hear passing. All that brief, trivial curtain-raiser, that negligible introit of a new day, performed without any spectator, a little scrap of life which was only for our two selves, which I should have no hesitation in repeating, later on, to Françoise or even to strangers, speaking of the fog ‘which you could have cut with a knife at six o’clock that morning, with the ostentation of one who was boasting not of a piece of knowledge that he had acquired but of a mark of affection shewn to himself alone; dear morning moment, opened like a symphony by the rhythmical dialogue of my three taps, to which the thin wall of my bedroom, steeped in love and joy, grown melodious, immaterial, singing like the angelic choir, responded with three other taps, eagerly awaited, repeated once and again, in which it contrived to waft to me the soul of my grandmother, whole and perfect, and the promise of her coming, with a swiftness of annunciation and melodic accuracy. But on this first night after our arrival, when my grandmqther had left me, I began again to feel as I had felt, the day before, in Paris, at the moment of leaving home. Perhaps this fear that I had — and shared with so many of my fellow-men — of sleeping in a strange room, perhaps this fear is only the most humble, obscure, organic, almost unconscious form of that great and desperate resistance set up by the things that constitute the better part of our present life towards our mentally assuming, by accepting it as true, the formula of a future in which those things are to have no part; a resistance which was at the root of the horror that I had so often been made to feel by the thought that my parents must, one day, die, that the stern necessity of life might qblige me to live remote from Gilberte, or simply to settle permanently in a place where I should never see any of my old friends; a resistance which was also at the root of the difficulty that I found in imagining my own death, or a survival such as Bergotte used to promise to mankind in his books, a survival in which I should not be allowed to take with me my memories, my frailties, my character, which did not easily resign themselves to the idea of ceasing to be, and desired for me neither annihilation nor an eternity in which they would have no part

   When Swann had said to me, in Paris one day when I felt particularly unwell: “You ought to go off to one of those glorious islands in the Pacific; you’d never come back again if you did.” I should have liked to answer: “But then I shall not see your daughter any more; I shall be living among people and things she has never seen.” And yet my better judgment whispered: “What difference can that make, since you are not going to be affected by it? When M. Swann tells you that you will not come back he means by that that you will not want to come back, and if you don’t want to that is because you will be happier out there.” For my judgment was aware that Habit — Habit which was even now setting to work to make me like this unfamiliar lodging, to change the position of the mirror, the shade of the curtains, to stop the clock — undertakes as well to make dear to us the companions whom at first we disliked, to give another appearance to their faces, to make attractive the sound of their voices, to modify the inclinations of their hearts. It is true that these new friendships for places and people are based upon forgetfulness of the old; but what my better judgment was thinking was simply that I could look without apprehension along the vista of a life in which I should be for ever separated from people all memory of whom I should lose, and it was by way of consolation that my mind was offering to my heart a promise of oblivion which succeeded only in sharpening the edge of its despair. Not that the heart also is not bound in time, when separation is complete, to feel the anodyne effect of habit; but until then it will continue to suffer. And our dread of a future in which we must forego the sight of faces, the sound of voices that we love, friends from whom we derive to-day our keenest joys, this dread, far from being dissipated, is intensified, if to the grief of such a privation we reflect that there will be added what seems to us now in anticipation an even more cruel grief; not to feel it as a grief at all — to remain indifferent; for if that should occur, our ego would have changed, it would then be not merely the attractiveness of our family, pur mistress, our friends that had ceased to environ us, but our affection for them; it would have been so completely eradicated from our heart, in which to-day it is a conspicuous element, that we should be able to enjoy that life apart from them the very thought of which to-day makes us recoil in horror; so that it would be in a real sense the death of ourselves, a death followed, it is true, by resurrection but in a different ego, the life, the love of which are beyond the reach of those elements of the existing ego that are doomed to die. It is they — even the meanest of them, such as our obscure attachments to the dimensions, to the atmosphere of a bedroom — that grow stubborn and refuse, in acts of rebellion which we must recognise to be a secret, partial, tangible and true aspect of our resistance to death, of the long resistance, desperate and daily renewed, to a fragmentary and gradual death such as interpolates itself throughout the whole course of our life, tearing away from us at every moment a shred of ourselves, dead matter on which new cells will multiply, and grow. And for a neurotic nature such as mine, one that is to say in which the intermediaries, the nerves, perform their functions badly — fail to arrest on its way to the consciousness, allow indeed to penetrate there, distinct, exhausting, innumerable, agonising, the plaint of those most humble elements of the personality which are about to disappear — the anxiety and alarm which I felt as I lay outstretched beneath that strange and too lofty ceiling were but the protest of an affection that survived in me for a ceiling that was familiar and low. Doubtless this affection too would disappear, and another have taken its place (when death, and then another life, would, in the guise of Habit, have performed their double task); but until its annihilation, every night it would suffer afresh, and on this first night especially, confronted with a future already realised in which there would no longer be any place for it, it rose in revolt, it tortured me with the sharp sound of its lamentations whenever my straining eyes, powerless to turn from what was wounding them, endeavoured to fasten their gaze upon that inaccessible ceiling

   But next morning! — after a servant had come to call me, and had brought me hot water, and while I was washing and dressing myself and trying in vain to find the things that I wanted in my trunk, from which I extracted, pell-mell, only a lot of things that were of no use whatever, what a joy it was to me, thinking already of the delights of luncheon and of a walk along the shore, to see in the window, and in all the glass fronts of the bookcases as in the portholes of a ship’s cabin, the open sea, naked, unshadowed, and yet with half of its expanse in shadow, bounded by a thin and fluctuant line, and to follow with my eyes the waves that came leaping towards me, one behind another, like divers along a springboard. Every other moment, holding in one hand the starched, unyielding towel, with the name of the hotel printed upon it, with which I was making futile efforts to dry myself, I returned to the window to gaze once more upon that vast amphitheatre, dazzling, mountainous, and upon the snowy crests of its emerald waves, here and there polished and translucent, which with a placid violence, a leonine bending of the brows, let their steep fronts, to which the sun now added a smile without face or features, run forward to their goal, totter and melt and be no more. Window in which I was, henceforward, to plant myself every morning, as at the pane of a mail coach in which one has slept, to see whether, in the night, a long sought mountain-chain has come nearer or withdrawn — only here it was those hills of the sea which, before they come dancing back towards us, are apt to retire so far that often it was only at the end of a long and sandy plain that I would distinguish, miles it seemed away, their first undulations upon a background transparent, vaporous, bluish, like the glaciers that one sees in the backgrounds of the Tuscan Primitives. On other mornings it was quite close at hand that the sun was smiling upon those waters of a green as tender as that preserved in Alpine pastures (among mountains on which the sun spreads himself here and there like a lazy giant who may at any moment come leaping gaily down their craggy sides) less by the moisture of their soil than by the liquid mobility of their light. Anyhow, in that breach which shore and water between them drive through all the rest of the world, for the passage, the accumulation there of light, it is light above all, according to the direction from which it comes and along which our eyes follow it, it is light that shifts and fixes the undulations of the sea. Difference of lighting modifies no less the orientation of a place, constructs no less before our eyes new goals which it inspires in us the yearning to attain, than would a distance in space actually traversed in the course of a long journey. When, in the morning, the sun came from behind the hotel, disclosing to me the sands bathed in light as far as the first bastions of the sea, it seemed to be shewing me another side of the picture, and to be engaging me in the pursuit, along the winding path of its rays, of a journey motionless but ever varied amid all the fairest scenes of the diversified landscape of the hours. And on this first morning the sun pointed out to me far off with a jovial finger those blue peaks of the sea, which bear no name upon any geographer’s chart, until, dizzy with its sublime excursion over the thundering and chaotic surface of their crests and avalanches, it came back to take shelter from the wind in my bedroom, swaggering across the unmade bed and scattering its riches over the splashed surface of the basin-stand, and into my open trunk, where by its very splendour and ill-matched luxury it added still further to the general effect of disorder. Alas, that wind from the sea; an hour later, in the great dining-room — while we were having our luncheon, and from the leathern gourd of a lemon were sprinkling a few golden drops on to a pair of soles which presently left on our plates the plumes of their picked skeletons, curled like stiff feathers and resonant as citherns — it seemed to my grandmother a cruel deprivation not to be able to feel its life-giving breath on her cheek, on account of the window, transparent but closed, which like the front of a glass case in a museum divided us from the beach while allowing us to look out upon its whole extent, and into which the sky entered so completely that its azure had the effect of being the colour of the windows and its white clouds only so many flaws in the glass. Imagining that I was ‘seated upon the mole’ or at rest in the ‘boudoir’ of which Baudelaire speaks I asked myself whether his ‘Sun’s rays upon the sea’ were not — a very different thing from the evening ray, simple and superficial as the wavering stroke of a golden pencil — just what at that moment was scorching the sea topaz-brown, fermenting it, turning it pale and milky like foaming beer, like milk, while now and then there hovered over it great blue shadows which some god seemed, for his pastime, to be shifting to and fro by moving a mirror in the sky. Unfortunately, it was not only in its outlook that it differed from our room at Combray, giving upon the houses over the way, this dining-room at Balbec, bare-walled, filled with a sunlight green as the water in a marble font, while a few feet away the full tide and broad daylight erected as though before the gates of the heavenly city an indestructible and moving rampart of emerald and gold. At Combray, since we were known to everyone, I took heed of no one. In life at the seaside one knows only one’s own party. I was not yet old enough, I was still too sensitive to have outgrown the desire to find favour in the sight of other people and to possess their hearts. Nor had I acquired the more noble indifference which a man of the world would have felt, with regard to the people who were eating their luncheon in the room, nor to the boys and girls who strolled past the window, with whom I was pained by the thought that I should never be allowed to go on expeditions, though not so much pained as if my grandmother, contemptuous of social formalities and concerned about nothing but my health, had gone to them with the request, humiliating for me to overhear, that they would consent to let me accompany them. Whether they were returning to some villa beyond my ken, or had emerged from it, racquet in hand, on their way to some lawn-tennis court, or were mounted on horses whose hooves trampled and tore my heart, I gazed at them with a passionate curiosity, in that blinding light of the beach by which social distinctions are altered, I followed all their movements through the transparency of that great bay of glass which allowed so much light to flood the room. But it intercepted the wind, and this seemed wrong to my grandmother, who, unable to endure the thought that I was losing the benefit of an hour in the open air, surreptitiously unlatched a pane and at once set flying, with the bills of fare, the newspapers, veils and hats of all the people at the other tables; she herself, fortified by the breath of heaven, remained calm and smiling like Saint Blandina, amid the torrent of invective which, increasing my sense of isolation and misery, those scornful, dishevelled, furious visitors combined to pour on us

   To a certain extent — and this, at Balbec, gave to the population, as a rule monotonously rich and cosmopolitan, of that sort of smart and ‘exclusive’ hotel, a quite distinctive local character — they were composed of eminent persons from the departmental capitals of that region of France, a chief magistrate from Caen, a leader of the Cherbourg bar, a big solicitor from Le Mans, who annually, when the holidays came round, starting from the various points over which, throughout the working year, they were scattered like snipers in a battle or draughtsmen upon a board, concentrated their forces upon this hotel. They always reserved the same rooms, and with their wives, who had pretensions to aristocracy, formed a little group, which was joined by a leading barrister and a leading doctor from Paris, who on the day of their departure would say to the others:

    “Oh, yes, of course; you don’t go by our train. You are fortunate, you will be home in time for luncheon.”

    “Fortunate, do you say? You, who live in the Capital, in ‘Paris, the great town,’ while I have to live in a wretched county town of a hundred thousand souls (it is true, we managed to muster a hundred and two thousand at the last census, but what is that compared to your two and a half millions?) going back, too, to asphalt streets and all the bustle and gaiety of Paris life?”

   They said this with a rustic burring of their r’s, but without bitterness, for they were leading lights each in his own province, who could like other people have gone to Paris had they chosen — the chief magistrate of Caen had several times been offered a judgeship in the Court of Appeal — but had preferred to stay where they were, from love of their native towns or of obscurity or of fame, or because they were reactionaries, and enjoyed being on friendly terms with the country houses of the neighbourhood. Besides several of them were not going back at once to their county towns

   For — inasmuch as the Bay of Balbec was a little world apart in the midst of a great world, a basketful of the seasons in which were clustered in a ring good days and bad, and the months in their order, so that not only, on days when one could make out Rivebelle, which was in itself a sign of coming storms, could one see the sunlight on the houses there while Balbec was plunged in darkness, but later on, when the cold weather had reached Balbec, one could be certain of finding on that opposite shore two or three supplementary months of warmth — those of the regular visitors to the Grand Hotel whose holidays began late or lasted long, gave orders, when rain and fog came and Autumn was in the air, for their boxes to be packed and embarked, and set sail across the Bay to find summer again at Rivebelle or Costedor. This little group in the Balbec hotel looked with distrust upon each new arrival, and while affecting to take not the least interest in him, hastened, all of them, to ply with questions their friend the head waiter. For it was the same head waiter — Aimé— who returned every year for the season, and kept their tables for them; and their good ladies, having heard that his wife was ‘expecting,’ would sit after meals working each at one of the ‘little things,’ stopping only to put up their glasses and stare at us, my grandmother and myself, because we were eating hard-boiled eggs in salad, which was considered common, and was, in fact, ‘not done’ in the best society of Alençon. They affected an attitude of contemptuous irony with regard to a Frenchman who was called ‘His Majesty’ and had indeed proclaimed himself King of a small island in the South Seas, inhabited by a few savages. He was staying in the hotel with his pretty mistress, whom, as she crossed the beach to bathe, the little boys would greet with “Three cheers for the Queen!” because she would reward them with a shower of small silver. The chief magistrate and the barrister went so far as to pretend not to see her, and if any of their friends happened to look at her, felt bound to warn him that she was only a little shop-girl

    “But I was told that at Ostend they used the royal bathing machine.”

    “Well, and why not? It’s on hire for twenty francs. You can take it yourself, if you care for that sort of thing. Anyhow, I know for a fact that the fellow asked for an audience, when he was there, with the King, who sent back word that he took no cognisance of any Pantomime Princes.” “Really, that’s interesting! What queer people there are in the world, to be sure!”

   And I dare say it was all quite true: but it was also from resentment of the thought that, to many of their fellow-visitors, they were themselves simply respectable but rather common people who did not know this King and Queen so prodigal with their small change, that the solicitor, the magistrate, the barrister, when what they were pleased to call the ‘Carnival’ went by, felt so much annoyance, and expressed aloud an indignation that was quite understood by their friend the head waiter who, obliged to shew proper civility to these generous if not authentic Sovereigns, still, while he took their orders, would dart from afar at his old patrons a covert but speaking glance. Perhaps there was also something of the same resentment at being erroneously supposed to be less and unable to explain that they were more smart, underlining the ‘fine specimen’ with which they qualified a young ‘blood,’ the consumptive and dissipated son of an industrial magnate, who appeared every day in a new suit of clothes with an orchid in his buttonhole, drank champagne at luncheon, and then strolled out of the hotel, pale, impassive, a smile of complete indifference on his lips, to the casino to throw away at the baccarat table enormous sums, ‘which he could ill afford to lose,’ as the solicitor said with a resigned air to the chief magistrate, whose wife had it ‘on good authority’ that this ‘detrimental’ young man was bringing his parents’ grey hair in sorrow to the grave

   On the other hand, the barrister and his friends could not exhaust their flow of sarcasm on the subject of a wealthy old lady of title, because she never moved anywhere without taking her whole household with her. Whenever the wives of the solicitor and the magistrate saw her in the dining-room at meal-times they put up their glasses and gave her an insolent scrutiny, as minute and distrustful as if she had been some dish with a pretentious name but a suspicious appearance which, after the negative result of a systematic study, must be sent away with a lofty wave of the hand and a grimace of disgust

   No doubt by this behaviour they meant only to shew that, if there were things in the world which they themselves lacked — in this instance, certain prerogatives which the old lady enjoyed, and the privilege of her acquaintance — it was not because they could not, but because they did not choose to acquire them. But they had succeeded in convincing themselves that this really was what they felt; and it was the suppression of all desire for, of all curiosity as to forms of life which were unfamiliar, of all hope of pleasing new people (for which, in the women, had been substituted a feigned contempt, an artificial brightness) that had the awkward result of obliging them to label their discontent satisfaction, and lie everlastingly to themselves, for which they were greatly to be pitied. But everyone else in the hotel was no doubt behaving in a similar fashion, though his behaviour might take a different form, and sacrificing, if not to self-importance, at any rate to certain inculcated principles and mental habits the thrilling delight of mixing in a strange kind of life. Of course, the atmosphere of the microcosm in which the old lady isolated herself was not poisoned with virulent bitterness, as was that of the group in which the wives of the solicitor and magistrate sat chattering with impotent rage. It was indeed embalmed with a delicate and old-world fragrance which, however, was none the less artificial. For at heart the old lady would probably have found in attracting, in attaching to herself (and, with that object, recreating herself), the mysterious sympathy of new friends a charm which is altogether lacking from the pleasure that is to be derived from mixing only with the people of one’s own world, and reminding oneself that, one’s own being the best of all possible worlds, the ill-informed contempt of ‘outsiders’ may be disregarded. Perhaps she felt that — were she to arriveincognito at the Grand Hotel, Balbec, she would, in her black stuff gown and old-fashioned bonnet, bring a smile to the lips of some old reprobate, who from the depths of his rocking chair would glance up and murmur, “What a scarecrow!” or, still worse, to those of some man of repute who bad, like the magistrate, kept between his pepper-and-salt whiskers a rosy complexion and a pair of sparkling eyes such as she liked to see, and would at once bring the magnifying lens of the conjugal glasses to bear upon so quaint a phenomenon; and perhaps it was in unconfessed dread of those first few minutes, which, though one knows that they will be but a few minutes, are none the less terrifying, like the first plunge of one’s head under water, that this old lady sent down in advance a servant, who would inform the hotel of the personality and habits of his mistress, and, cutting short the manager’s greetings, made, with an abruptness in which there was more timidity than pride, for her room, where her own curtains, substituted for those that draped the hotel windows, her own screens and photographs, set up so effectively between her and the outside world, to which otherwise she would have had to adapt herself, the barrier of her private life that it was her home (in which she had comfortably stayed) that travelled rather than herself

   Thenceforward, having placed between herself, on the one hand, and the staff of the hotel and its decorators on the other the servants who bore instead of her the shock of contact with all this strange humanity, and kept up around their mistress her familiar atmosphere, having set her prejudices between herself and the other visitors, indifferent whether or not she gave offence to people whom her friends would not have had in their houses, it was in her own world that she continued to live, by correspondence with her friends, by memories, by her intimate sense of and confidence in her own position, the quality of her manners, the competence of her politeness. And every day, when she came downstairs to go for a drive in her own carriage, the lady’s-maid who came after her carrying her wraps, the footman who preceded her, seemed like sentries who, at the gate of an embassy, flying the flag of the country to which she belonged, assured to her upon foreign soil the privilege of extra-territoriality. She did not leave her room until late in the afternoon on the day following our arrival, so that we did not see her in the dining-room, into which the manager, since we were strangers there, conducted us, taking us under his wing, as a corporal takes a squad of recruits to the master-tailor, to have them fitted; we did see however, a moment later, a country gentleman and his daughter, of an obscure but very ancient Breton family, M. and Mlle, de Stermaria, whose table had been allotted to us, in the belief that they had gone out and would not be back until the evening. Having come to Balbec only to see various country magnates whom they knew in that neighbourhood, they spent in the hotel dining-room, what with the invitations they accepted and the visits they paid, only such time as was strictly unavoidable. It was their stiffness that preserved them intact from all human sympathy, from interesting at all the strangers seated round about them, among whom M. de Stermaria kept up the glacial, preoccupied, distant, rude, punctilious and distrustful air that we assume in a railway refreshment-room, among fellow-passengers whom we have never seen before and will never see again, and with whom we can conceive of no other relations than to defend from their onslaught our ‘portion’ of cold chicken and our corner seat in the train. No sooner had we begun our luncheon than we were asked to leave the table, on the instructions of M. de Stermaria who had just arrived and, without the faintest attempt at an apology to us, requested the head waiter, in our hearing, to “see that such a mistake did not occur again,” for it was repugnant to him that “people whom he did not know” should have taken his table

   And certainly into the feeling which impelled a young actress (better known, though, for her smart clothes, her smart sayings, her collection of German porcelain, than in the occasional parts that she had played at the Odéon), her lover, an immensely rich young man for whose sake she had acquired her culture, and two sprigs of aristocracy at that time much in the public eye to form a little band apart, to travel only together, to come down to luncheon — when at Balbec — very late, after everyone had finished; to spend the whole day in their sitting-room playing cards, there entered no sort of ill-humour against the rest of us but simply the requirements of the taste that they had formed for a certain type of conversation, for certain refinements of good living, which made them find pleasure in spending their time, in taking their meals only by themselves, and would have rendered intolerable a life in common with people who had not been initiated into those mysteries. Even at a dinner or a card table, each of them had to be certain that, in the diner or partner who sat opposite to him, there was, latent and not yet made use of, a certain brand of knowledge which would enable him to identify the rubbish with which so many houses in Paris were littered as genuine mediaeval or renaissance ‘pieces’ and, whatever the subject of discussion, to apply the critical standards common to all their party whereby they distinguished good work from bad. Probably it was only — at such moments — by some infrequent, amusing interruption flung into the general silence of meal or game, or by the new and charming frock which the young actress had put on for luncheon or for poker, that the special kind of existence in which these four friends desired, above all things, to remain plunged was made apparent. But by engulfing them thus in a system of habits which they knew by heart it sufficed to protect them from the mystery of the life that was going on all round them. All the long afternoon, the sea was suspended there before their eyes only as a canvas of attractive colouring might hang on the wall of a wealthy bachelor’s flat and it was only in the intervals between the ‘hands’ that one of the players, finding nothing better to do, raised his eyes to it to seek from it some indication of the weather or the time, and to remind the others that tea was ready. And at night they did not dine in the hotel, where, hidden springs of electricity flooding the great dining-room with light, it became as it were an immense and wonderful aquarium against whose wall of glass the working population of Balbec, the fishermen and also the tradesmen’s families, clustering invisibly in the outer darkness, pressed their faces to watch, gently floating upon the golden eddies within, the luxurious life of its occupants, a thing as extraordinary to the poor as the life of strange fishes or molluscs (an important social question, this: whether the wall of glass will always protect the wonderful creatures at their feasting, whether the obscure folk who watch them hungrily out of the night will not break in some day to gather them from their aquarium and devour them). Meanwhile there may have been, perhaps, among the gazing crowd, a motionless, formless mass there in the dark, some writer, some student of human ichthyology who, as he watched the jaws of old feminine monstrosities close over a mouthful of food which they proceeded then to absorb, was amusing himself by classifying them according to their race, by their innate characteristics as well as by those acquired characteristics which bring it about that an old Serbian lady whose buccal protuberance is that of a great sea-fish, because from her earliest years she has moved in the fresh waters of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, eats her salad for all the world like a La Rochefoucauld

   At that hour one could see the three young men in dinner-jackets, waiting for the young woman, who was as usual late but presently, wearing a dress that was almost always different and one of a series of scarves, chosen to gratify some special instinct in her lover, after having from her landing rung for the lift, would emerge from it like a doll coming out of its box. And then all four, because they found that the international phenomenon of the ‘Palace,’ planted on Balbec soil, had blossomed there in material splendour rather than in food that was fit to eat, bundled into a carriage and went to dine, a mile off, in a little restaurant that was well spoken of, where they held with the cook himself endless discussions of the composition of their meal and the cooking of its various dishes. During their drive, the road bordered with apple-trees that led out of Balbec was no more to them than the distance that must be traversed — barely distinguishable in the darkness from that which separated their homes in Paris from the Café Anglais or the Tour d’Argent — before they could arrive at the fashionable little restaurant where, while the young man’s friends envied him because he had such a smartly dressed mistress, the latter’s scarves were spread about the little company like a fragrant, flowing veil, but one that kept it apart from the outer world

   Alas for my peace of mind, I had none of the detachment that all these people shewed. To many of them I gave constant thought; I should have liked not to pass unobserved by a man with a receding brow and eyes that dodged between the blinkers of his prejudices and his education, the great nobleman of the district, who was none other than the brother-in-law of Legrandin, and came every now and then to see somebody at Balbec and on Sundays, by reason of the weekly garden-party that his wife and he gave, robbed the hotel of a large number of its occupants, because one or two of them were invited to these entertainments and the others, so as not to appear to have been not invited, chose that day for an expedition to some distant spot. He had had, as it happened, an exceedingly bad reception at the hotel on the first day of the season, when the staff, freshly imported from the Riviera, did not yet know who or what he was. Not only was he not wearing white flannels, but, with old-fashioned French courtesy and in his ignorance of the ways of smart hotels, on coming into the hall in which there were ladies sitting, he had taken off his hat at the door, the effect of which had been that the manager did not so much as raise a finger to his own in acknowledgment, concluding that this must be some one of the most humble extraction, what he called ‘sprung from the ordinary.’ The solicitor’s wife, alone, had felt herself attracted by the stranger, who exhaled all the starched vulgarity of the really respectable, and had declared, with the unerring discernment and the indisputable authority of a person from whom the highest society of Le Mans held no secrets, that one could see at a glance that one was in the presence of a gentleman of great distinction, of perfect breeding, a striking contrast to the sort of people one usually saw at Balbec, whom she condemned as impossible to know so long as she did not know them. This favourable judgment which she had pronounced on Legrandin’s brother-in-law was based perhaps on the spiritless appearance of a man about whom there was nothing to intimidate anyone; perhaps also she had recognised in this gentleman farmer with the gait of a sacristan the Masonic signs of her own inveterate clericalism

   It made no difference my knowing that the young fellows who went past the hotel every day on horseback were the sons of the questionably solvent proprietor of a linen-drapery to whom my father would never have dreamed of speaking; the glamour of ‘seaside life’ exalted them in my eyes to equestrian statues of demi-gods, and the best thing that I could hope for was that they would never allow their proud gaze to fall upon the wretched boy who was myself, who left the hotel dining-room only to sit humbly upon the sands. I should have been glad to arouse some response even from the adventurer who had been king of a desert island in the South Seas, even of the young consumptive, of whom I liked to think that he was hiding beneath his insolent exterior a shy and tender heart, which would perhaps have lavished on me, and on me alone, the treasures of its affection. Besides (unlike what one generally says of the people one meets when travelling) just as being seen in certain company can invest us, in a watering-place to which we shall return another year, with a coefficient that has no equivalent in our true social life, so there is nothing — not which we keep so resolutely at a distance, but — which we cultivate with such assiduity after our return to Paris as the friendships that we have formed by the sea. I was anxious about the opinion that might be held of me by all these temporary or local celebrities whom my tendency to put myself in the place of other people and to reconstruct what was in their minds had made me place not in their true rank, that which they would have held in Paris, for instance, and which would have been quite low, but in that which they must imagine to be, and which indeed was their rank at Balbec, where the want of a common denominator gave them a sort of relative superiority and an individual interest. Alas, none of these people’s contempt for me was so unbearable as that of M. de Stermaria

   For I had noticed his daughter, the moment she came into the room, her pretty features, her pallid, almost blue complexion, what there was peculiar in the carriage of her tall figure, in her gait, which suggested to me — and rightly — her long descent, her aristocratic upbringing, all the more vividly because I knew her name, like those expressive themes composed by musicians of genius which paint in splendid colours the glow of fire, the rush of water, the peace of fields and woods, to audiences who, having first let thçir eyes run over the programme, have their imaginations trained in the right direction. The label ‘Centuries of Breeding,’ by adding to Mlle, de Stermaria’s charms the idea of their origin, made them more desirable also, advertising their rarity as a high price enhances the value of a thing that has already taken our fancy. And its stock of heredity gave to her complexion, in which so many selected juices had been blended, the savour of an exotic fruit or of a famous vintage

   And then mere chance put into our hands, my grandmother’s and mine, the means of giving ourselves an immediate distinction in the eyes of all the other occupants of the hotel. On that first afternoon, at the moment when the old lady came downstairs from her room, producing, thanks to the footman who preceded her, the maid who came running after her with a book and a rug that had been left behind, a marked effect upon all who beheld her and arousing in each of them a curiosity from which it was evident that none was so little immune as M. de Stermaria, the manager leaned across to my grandmother and, from pure kindness of heart (as one might point out the Shah, or Queen Ranavalo to an obscure onlooker who could obviously have no sort of connexion with so mighty a potentate, but might be interested, all the same, to know that he had been standing within a few feet of one) whispered in her ear, “The Marquise de Villeparisis!” while at the same moment the old lady, catching sight of my grandmother,-could not repress a start of pleased surprise

   It may be imagined that the sudden appearance, in the guise of a. little old woman, of the most powerful of fairies would not have given me so much pleasure, destitute as I was of any means of access to Mlle, de Stermaria, in a strange place where I knew no one: no one, that is to say, for any practical purpose. Aesthetically the number of types of humanity is so restricted that we must constantly, wherever we may be, have the pleasure of seeing people we know, even without looking for them in the works of the old masters, like Swann. Thus it happened that in the first few days of our visit to Balbec I had succeeded in finding Legrandin, Swann’s hall porter and Mme. Swann herself, transformed into a waiter, a foreign visitor whom I never saw again and a bathing superintendent. And a sort of magnetism attracts and retains so inseparably, one after another, certain characteristics, facial and mental, that when nature thus introduces a person into a new body she does not mutilate him unduly. Legrandin turned waiter kept intact his stature, the outline of his nose, part of his chin; Mme. Swann, in the masculine gender and the calling of a bathing superintendent, had been accompanied not only by familiar features, but even by the way she had of speaking. Only, she could be of little if any more use to me, standing upon the beach there in the red sash of her office, and hoisting at the first gust of wind the flag which forbade us to bathe (for these superintendents are prudent men, and seldom know how to swim) than she would have been in that fresco of the Life of Moses in which Swann had long ago identified her in the portrait of Jethro’s Daughter. Whereas this Mme. de Villeparisis was her real self, she had not been the victim of an enchantment which had deprived her of her power, but was capable, on the contrary, of putting at the service of my power an enchantment which would multiply it an hundredfold, and thanks to which, as though I had been swept through the air on the wings of a fabulous bird, I was to cross in a few moments the infinitely wide (at least, at Balbec) social gulf which separated me from Mlle, de Stermaria

   Unfortunately, if there was one person in the world who, more than anyone else, lived shut up in a little world of her own, it was my grandmother. She would not, indeed, have despised me, she would simply not have understood what I meant had she been told that I attached importance to the opinions, that I felt an interest in the persons of people the very existence of whom she had never noticed and would, when the time came to leave Balbec, retain no impression of their names. I dared not confess to her that if these same people had seen her talking to Mme. de Villeparisis, I should have been immensely gratified, because I felt that the Marquise counted for much in the hotel and that her friendship would have given us a position in the eyes of Mlle, de Stermaria. Not that my grandmother’s friend represented to me, in any sense of the word, a member of the aristocracy: I was too well used to her name, which had been familiar to my ears before my mind had begun to consider it, when as a child I had heard it occur in conversation at home: while her title added to it only a touch of quaintness — as some uncommon Christian name would have done, or as in the names of streets, among which we can see nothing more noble in the Rue Lord Byron, in the plebeian and even squalid Rue Rochechouart, or in the Rue Grammont than in the Rue Léonce Reynaud or the Rue Hyppolyte Lebas. Mme. de Villeparisis no more made me think of a person who belonged to a special world than did her cousin MacMahon, whom I did not clearly distinguish from M. Carnot, likewise President of the Republic, or from Raspail, whose photograph Françoise had bought with that of Pius IX. It was one of my grandmother’s principles that, when away from home, one should cease to have any social intercourse, that one did not go to the seaside to meet people, having plenty of time for that sort of thing in Paris, that they would make one waste on being merely polite, in pointless conversation, the precious time which ought all to be spent in the open air, beside the waves; and finding it convenient to assume that this view was shared by everyone else, and that it authorised, between old friends whom chance brought face to face in the same hotel, the fiction of a mutual incognito, on hearing her friend’s name from the manager she merely looked the other way, and pretended not to see Mme. de Villeparisis, who, realising that my grandmother did not want to be recognised, looked also into the void. She went past, and I was left in my isolation like a shipwrecked mariner who has seen a vessel apparently coming towards him which has then, without lowering a boat, vanished under the horizon

   She, too, had her meals in the dining-room, but at the other end of it. She knew none of the people who were staying in the hotel, or who came there to call, not even M. de Cambremer; in fact, I noticed that he gave her no greeting, one day when, with his wife, he had accepted an invitation to take luncheon with the barrister, who drunken with the honour of having the nobleman at his table avoided his friends of every day, and confined himself to a distant twitch of the eyelid, so as to draw their attention to this historic event but so discreetly that his signal could not be interpreted by them as an invitation to join the party

    “Well, I hope you’ve got on your best clothes; I hope you feel smart enough,” was the magistrate’s wife’s greeting to him that evening

    “Smart? Why should I?” asked the barrister, concealing his rapture in an exaggerated astonishment. “Because of my guests, do you mean?” he went on, feeling that it was impossible to keep up the farce any longer. “But what is there smart about having a few friends in to luncheon? After all, they must feed somewhere!”

    “But it is smart! They are the de Cambremers, aren’t they? I recognized them at once. She is a Marquise. And quite genuine, too. Not through the females.”

    “Oh, she’s a very simple soul, she is charming, no stand-offishness about her. I thought you were coming to join us. I was making signals to you . . . I would have introduced you!” he asserted, tempering with a hint of irony the vast generosity of the offer, like Ahasuerus when he says to Esther:

                           Of all my Kingdom must I give you half!

“No, no, no, no! We lie hidden, like the modest violet.”

    “But you were quite wrong, I assure you,” replied the barrister, growing bolder now that the danger point was passed. “They weren’t going to eat you. I say, aren’t we going to have our little game of bezique?”

    “Why, of course! We were afraid to suggest it, now that you go about entertaining Marquises.”

    “Oh, get along with you; there’s nothing so very wonderful about them, Why, I’m dining there to-morrow. Would you care to go instead of me? I mean it. Honestly, I’d just as soon stay here.”

    “No, no! I should be removed from the bench as a Reactionary,” cried the chief magistrate, laughing till the tears stood in his eyes at his own joke. “But you go to Féterne too, don’t you?” he went on, turning to the solicitor

    “Oh, I go there on Sundays — in at one door and out at the other. But I don’t have them here to luncheon, like the Leader.” M. de Stermaria was not at Balbec that day, to the barrister’s great regret. But he managed to say a word in season to the head waiter:

    “Aimé, you can tell M. de Stermaria that he’s not the only nobleman you’ve had in here. You saw the gentleman who was with me to-day at luncheon? Eh? A small moustache, looked like a military man. Well, that was the Marquis de Cambremer!”

    “Was it indeed? I’m not surprised to hear it.”

    “That will shew him that he’s not the only man who’s got a title. That will teach him! It’s not a bad thing to take ’em down a peg or two, those noblemen. I say, Aimé, don’t say anything to him unless you like: I mean to say, it’s no business of mine; besides, they know each other already.”

   And next day M. de Stermaria, who remembered that the barrister had once held a brief for one of his friends, came up and introduced himself

    “Our friends in common, the de Cambremers, were anxious that we should meet; the days didn’t fit; I don’t know quite what went wrong —” stammered the barrister, who, like most liars, imagined that other people do not take the trouble to investigate an unimportant detail which, for all that, may be sufficient (if chance puts you in possession of the humble facts of the case, and they contradict it) to shew the liar in his true colours and to inspire a lasting mistrust

   Then as at all times, but more easily now that her father had left her and was talking to the barrister, I was gazing at Mlle, de Stermaria. No less than the bold and always graceful originality of her attitudes, as when, leaning her elbows on the table, she raised her glass in both hands over her outstretched arms, the dry flame of a glance at once extinguished, the ingrained, congenital hardness that one could feel, ill-concealed by her own personal inflexions, in the sound of her voice, which had shocked my grandmother; a sort of atavistic starting point to which she recoiled whenever, by glance or utterance, she had succeeded in expressing a thought of her own; all of these qualities carried the mind of him who watched her back to the line of ancestors who had bequeathed to her that inadequacy of human sympathy, those blanks in her sensibility, that short measure of humanity which was at every moment running out. But from a certain look which flooded for a moment the wells — instantly dry again — of her eyes, a look in which I could discern that almost obsequious docility which the predominance of a taste for sensual pleasures gives to the proudest of women, who will soon come to recognise but one form of personal distinction, that namely which any man enjoys who can make her feel those pleasures, an actor, an acrobat even, for whom, perhaps, she will one day leave her husband; — from a certain rosy tint, warm and sensual, which flushed her pallid cheeks, like the colour that stained the hearts of the white water-lilies in the Vivonne, I thought I could discern that she would readily have consented to my coming to seek in her the savour of that life of poetry and romance which she led in Brittany, a life to which, whether from over-familiarity or from innate superiority, or from disgust at the penury or the avarice of her family, she seemed not to attach any great value, but which, for all that, she held enclosed in her body. In the meagre stock of will-power that had been transmitted to her, and gave an element of weakness to her expression, she would not perhaps have found the strength to resist. And, crowned by a feather that was a trifle old-fashioned and pretentious, the grey felt hat which she invariably wore at meals made her all the more attractive to me, not because it was in harmony with her pearly or rosy complexion, but because, by making me suppose her to be poor, it brought her closer to myself. Obliged by her father’s presence to adopt a conventional attitude, but already bringing to the perception and classification of the people who passed before her eyes other principles than his, perhaps she saw in me not my humble rank, but the right sex and age. If one day M. de Stermaria had gone out leaving her behind, if, above all, Mme. de Villeparisis, by coming to sit at our table, had given her an opinion of me which might have emboldened me to approach her, perhaps then we might have contrived to exchange a few words, to arrange a meeting, to form a closer tie. And for a whole month during which she would be left alone, without her parents, in her romantic Breton castle, we should perhaps have been able to wander by ourselves at evening, she and I together in the dusk which would shew in a softer light above the darkening water pink briar roses, beneath oak trees beaten and stunted by the hammering of the waves. Together we should have roamed that isle impregnated with so intense a charm for me because it had enclosed the everyday life of Mlle, de Stermaria and lay at rest in her remembering eyes. For it seemed to me that I should not really have possessed her save there, when I should have traversed those regions which enveloped her in so many memories — a veil which my desire sought to tear apart, one of those veils which nature interposes between woman and her pursuers (with the same intention as when, for all of us, she places the act of reproduction between ourselves and our keenest pleasure, and for insects, places before the nectar the pollen which they must carry away with them) in order that, tricked by the illusion of possessing her thus more completely, they may be forced to occupy first the scenes among which she lives, and which, of more service to their imagination than sensual pleasure can be, yet would not without that pleasure have had the power to attract them

   But I was obliged to take my eyes from Mlle, de Stermaria, for already, considering no doubt that making the acquaintance of an important person was a brief, inquisitive act which was sufficient in itself, and to bring out all the interest that was latent in it required only a handshake and a penetrating stare, without either immediate conversation or any subsequent relations, her father had taken leave of the barrister and returned to sit down facing her, rubbing his hands like a man who has just made a valuable acquisition. As for the barrister, once the first emotion of this interview had subsided, then, as on other days, he could be heard every minute addressing the head waiter:

    “But I am not a king, Aimé; go and attend to the king! I say, Chief, those little trout don’t look at all bad, do they? We must ask Aimé to let us have some. Aimé, that little fish you have over there looks to me highly commendable; will you bring us some, please, Aimé, and don’t be sparing with it?”

   He would repeat the name ‘Aimé’ all day long, one result of which was that when he had anyone to dinner the guest would remark “I can see, you are quite at home in this place,” and would feel himself obliged to keep, on saying ‘Aimé’ also, from that tendency, combining elements of timidity, vulgarity and silliness, which many people have, to believe that it is smart and witty to copy to the letter what is said by the company in which they may happen to be. The barrister repeated the name incessantly, but with a smile, for he felt that he was exhibiting at once the good terms on which he stood with the head waiter and his own superior station. And the head waiter, whenever he caught the sound of his own name, smiled too, as though touched and at the same time proud, shewing that he was conscious of the honour and could appreciate the pleasantry

   Terrifying as I always found these meals, in the vast restaurant, generally full, of the mammoth hotel, they became even more terrifying when there arrived for a few days the Proprietor (or he may have been only the General Manager, appointed by a board of directors) not only of this ‘palace’ but of seven or eight more besides, situated at all the four corners of France, in each of which, travelling continuously, he would spend a week now and again. Then, just after dinner had begun, there appeared every evening in the doorway of the dining-room this small man with white hair and a red nose, astonishingly neat and impassive, who was known, it appeared, as well in London as at Monte-Carlo, as one of the leading hotel-keepers in Europe. Once when I had gone out for a moment at the beginning of dinner, as I came in again I passed close by him, and he bowed to me, but with a coldness in which I could not distinguish whether it should be attributed to the reserve of a man who could never forget what he was, or to his contempt for a customer of so little importance. To those whose importance was considerable the Managing Director would bow, with quite as much coldness but more deeply, lowering his eyelids with a reverence that was almost offended modesty, as though he had found himself confronted, at a funeral, with the father of the deceased or with the Blessed Sacrament. Except for these icy and infrequent salutations, he made not the slightest movement, as if to show that his glittering eyes, which appeared to be starting out of his head, saw everything, controlled everything, assured to us in the ‘Hotel dinner’ perfection in every detail as well as a general harmony. He felt, evidently, that he was more than the producer of a play, than the conductor of an orchestra, nothing less than a general in supreme command. Having decided that a contemplation carried to its utmost intensity would suffice to assure him that everything was in readiness, that no mistake had been made which could lead to disaster — to invest him, in a word, with full responsibility, he abstained not merely from any gesture but even from moving his eyes, which, petrified by the intensity of their gaze, took in and directed everything that was going on. I felt that even the movements of my spoon did not escape him, and were he to vanish after the soup, for the whole of dinner the review that he had held would have taken away my appetite. His own was exceedingly good, as one could see at luncheon, which he took like an ordinary guest of the hotel at a table that anyone else might have had in the public dining-room. His table had this peculiarity only, that by his side, while he was eating, the other manager, the resident one, remained standing all the time to make conversation. For being subordinate to this Managing Director he was anxious to please a man of whom he lived in constant fear. My fear of him diminished during these luncheons, for being then lost in the crowd of visitors he would exercise the discretion of a general sitting in a restaurant where there are also private soldiers, in not seeming to take any notice of them. Nevertheless when the porter, from among a cluster of pages, announced to me: “He leaves to-morrow morning for Dinard. Then he’s going down to Biarritz, and after that to Cannes,” I began to breathe more freely

   My life in the hotel was rendered not only dull because I had no friends there but uncomfortable because Françoise had made so many. It might be thought that they would have made things easier for us in various respects. Quite the contrary. The proletariat, if they succeeded only with great difficulty in being treated as people she knew by Françoise, and could not succeed at all unless they fulfilled the condition of shewing the utmost politeness to her, were, on the other hand, once they had reached the position, the only people who ‘counted.’ Her time-honoured code taught her that she was in no way bound to the friends of her employers, that she might, if she was busy, shut the door without ceremony in the face of a lady who had come to call on my grandmother. But towards her own acquaintance, that is to say, the select handful of the lower orders whom she admitted to an unconquerable intimacy, her actions were regulated by the most subtle and most stringent of protocols. Thus Françoise having made the acquaintance of the man in the coffee-shop and of a little maid who did dressmaking for a Belgian lady, no longer came upstairs immediately after luncheon to get my grandmother’s things ready, but came an hour later, because the coffee man had wanted to make her a cup of coffee or a tisane in his shop, or the maid had invited her to go and watch her sew, and to refuse either of them would have been impossible, and one of the things that were not done. Moreover, particular attention was due to the little sewing-maid, who was an orphan and had been brought up by strangers to whom she still went occasionally for a few days’ holiday. Her unusual situation aroused Franchise’s pity, and also a benevolent contempt. She, who had a family, a little house that had come to her from her parents, with a field in which her brother kept his cows, how could she regard so uprooted a creature as her equal? And since this girl hoped, on Assumption Day, to be allowed to pay her benefactors a visit, Françoise kept on repeating: “She does make me laugh! She says, ‘I hope to be going home for the Assumption.’ ‘Home!’ says she! It isn’t just that it’s not her own place, they’re people who took her in from nowhere, and the creature says ‘home’ just as if it really was her home. Poor girl! What a wretched state she must be in, not to know what it is to have a home.” Still, if Françoise had associated only with the ladies’-maids brought to the hotel by other visitors, who fed with her in the ‘service’ quarters and, seeing her grand lace cap and her handsome profile, took her perhaps for some lady of noble birth, whom ‘reduced circumstances,’ or a personal attachment had driven to serve as companion to my grandmother, if in a word Françoise had known only people who did not belong to the hotel, no great harm would have been done, since she could not have prevented them from doing us any service, for the simple reason that in no circumstances, even without her knowledge, would it have been possible for them to serve us at all. But she had formed connexions also with one of the wine waiters, with a man in the kitchen, and with the head chambermaid of our landing. And the result of this in our everyday life was that Françoise, who on the day of her arrival, when she still did not know anypne, would set all the bells jangling for the slightest thing, at an hour when my grandmother and I would never have dared to ring, and if we offered some gentle admonition answered: “Well, we’re paying enough for it, aren’t we?” as though it were she herself that would have to pay; nowadays, since she had made friends with a personage in the kitchen, which had appeared to us to augur well for our future comfort, were my grandmother or I to complain of cold feet, Françoise, even at an hour that was quite normal, dared not ring; she assured us that it would give offence because they would have to light the furnace again, or because it would interrupt the servants’ dinner and they would be annoyed. And she ended with a formula that, in spite of the ambiguous way in which she uttered it, was none the less clear, and put us plainly in the wrong: “The fact is . . . ” We did not insist, for fear of bringing upon ourselves another, far more serious: “It’s a matter . . .!” So that it amounted to this, that we could no longer have any hot water because Françoise had become a friend of the man who would have to heat it

   In the end we too formed a connexion, in spite of but through my grandmother, for she and Mme. de Villeparisis came in collision one morning in a doorway and were obliged to accost each other, not without having first exchanged gestures of surprise and hesitation, performed movements of recoil and uncertainty, and finally uttered protestations of joy and greeting, as in some of Molière’s plays, where two actors who have been delivering long soliloquies from opposite sides of the stage, a few feet apart, are supposed not to have seen each other yet, and then suddenly catch sight of each other, cannot believe their eyes, break off what they are saying and finally address each other (the chorus having meanwhile kept the dialogue going) and fall into each other’s arms. Mme. de Villeparisis was tactful, and made as if to leave my grandmother to herself after the first greetings, but my grandmother insisted on her staying to talk to her until luncheon, being anxious to discover how her friend managed to get her letters sent up to her earlier than we got ours, and to get such nice grilled things (for Mme. de Villeparisis, a great epicure, had the poorest opinion of the hotel kitchen which served us with meals that my grandmother, still quoting Mme. de Sévigné, described as “of a magnificence to make you die of hunger.”) And the Marquise formed the habit of coming every day, until her own meal was ready, to sit down for a moment at our table in the dining-room, insisting that we should not rise from our chairs or in any way put ourselves out. At the most we would linger, as often as not, in the room after finishing our luncheon, to talk to her, at that sordid moment when the knives are left littering the tablecloth among crumpled napkins. For my own part, so as to preserve (in order that I might be able to enjoy Balbec) the idea that I was on the uttermost promontory of the earth, I compelled myself to look farther afield, to notice only the sea, to seek in it the effects described by Baudelaire and to let my gaze fall upon our table only on days when there was set on it some gigantic fish, some marine monster, which unlike the knives and forks was contemporary with the primitive epochs in which the Ocean first began to teem with life, in the Cimmerians’ time, a fish whose body with its numberless vertebrae, its blue veins and red, had been constructed by nature, but according to an architectural plan, like a polychrome cathedral of the deep

   As a barber, seeing an officer whom he is accustomed to shave with special deference and care recognise a customer who has just entered the shop and stop for a moment to talk to him, rejoices in the thought that these are two men of the same social order, and cannot help smiling as he goes to fetch the bowl of soap, for he knows that in his establishment,’ to the vulgar routine of a mere barber’s-shop, are being added social, not to say aristocratic pleasures, so Aimé, seeing that Mme. de Villeparisis had found in us old friends, went to fetch our finger-bowls with precisely the smile, proudly modest and knowingly discreet, of a hostess who knows when to leave her guests to themselves. He suggested also a pleased and loving father who looks on, without interfering, at the happy pair who have plighted their troth at his hospitable board. Besides, it was enough merely to utter the name of a person of title for Aimé to appear pleased, unlike Françoise, before whom you could not mention Count So-and-so without her face darkening and her speech becoming dry and sharp, all of which meant that she worshipped the aristocracy not less than Aimé but far more. But then Françoise had that quality which in others she condemned as the worst possible fault; she was proud. She was not of that friendly and good-humoured race to which Aimé belonged. They feel, they exhibit an intense delight when you tell them a piece of news which may be more or less sensational but is at any rate new, and not to be found in the papers. Françoise declined to appear surprised. You might have announced in her hearing that the Archduke Rudolf — not that she had the least suspicion of his having ever existed — was not, as was generally supposed, dead, but ‘alive and kicking’; she would have answered only ‘Yes,’ as though she had known it all the time. It may, however, have been that if even from our own lips, from us whom she so meekly called her masters, who had so nearly succeeded in taming her, she could not, without having to check an angry start, hear the name of a noble, that was because the family from which she had sprung occupied in its own village a comfortable and independent position, and was not to be threatened in the consideration which it enjoyed save by those same nobles, in whose households, meanwhile, from his boyhood, an Aimé would have been domiciled as a servant, if not actually brought up by their charity. Of Françoise, then, Mme. de Villeparisis must ask pardon, first, for her nobility. But (in France, at any rate) that is precisely the talent, in fact the sole occupation of our great gentlemen and ladies. Françoise, following the common tendency of servants, who pick up incessantly from the conversation of their masters with other people fragmentary observations from which they are apt to draw erroneous inductions, as the human race generally does with respect to the habits of animals, was constantly discovering that somebody had ‘failed’ us, a conclusion to which she was easily led, not so much, perhaps, by her extravagant love for us, as by the delight that she took in being disagreeable to us. But having once established, without possibility of error, the endless little attentions paid to us, and paid to herself also by Mme. de Villeparisis, Françoise forgave her for being a Marquise, and, as she had never ceased to be proud of her because she was one, preferred her thenceforward to all our other friends. It must be added that no one else took the trouble to be so continually nice to us. Whenever my grandmother remarked on a book that Mme. de Villeparisis was reading, or said she had been admiring the fruit which some one had just sent to our friend, within an hour the footman would come to our rooms with book or fruit. And the next time we saw her, in response to our thanks, she would say only, seeming to seek some excuse for the meagreness of her present in some special use to which it might be put: “It’s nothing wonderful, but the newspapers come so late here, one must have something to read.” Or, “It is always wiser to have fruit one can be quite certain of, at the seaside.”—“But I don’t believe I’ve ever seen you eating oysters,” she said to us, increasing the sense of disgust which I felt at that moment, for the living flesh of the oyster revolted me even more than the gumminess of the stranded jellyfish defiled for me the beach at Balbec; “they are delicious down here! Oh, let me tell my maid to fetch your letters when she goes for mine. What, your daughter writes every day? But what on earth can you find to say to each other?” My grandmother was silent, but it may be assumed that her silence was due to scorn, in her who used to repeat, when she wrote to Mamma, the words of Mme. de Sévigné: “As soon as I have received a letter, I want another at once; I cannot breathe until it comes. There are few who are worthy to understand what I mean.” And I was afraid of her applying to Mme. de Villeparisis the conclusion: “I seek out those who are of the chosen few, and I avoid the rest.” She fell back upon praise of the fruit which Mme. de Villeparisis had sent us the day before. And this had been, indeed, so fine that the manager, in spite of the jealousy aroused by our neglect of his official offerings, had said to me: “I am like you; I’m madder about fruit than any other kind of dessert.” My grandmother told her friend that she had enjoyed them all the more because the fruit which we got in the hotel was generally horrid. “I cannot,” she went on, “say, like Mme. de Sévigné, that if we should take a sudden fancy for bad fruit we should be obliged to order it from Paris.” “Oh yes, of course, you read Mme. de Sévigné. I saw you with her letters the day you came.” (She forgot that she had never officially seen my grandmother in the hotel until their collision in the doorway.) “Don’t you find it rather exaggerated, her constant anxiety about her daughter? She refers to it too often to be really sincere. She is not natural.” My grandmother felt that any discussion would be futile, and so as not to be obliged to speak of the things she loved to a person incapable of understanding them, concealed by laying her bag upon them the Mémoires de Mme. de Beausergent

   Were she to encounter Françoise at the moment (which Françoise called ‘the noon’) when, wearing her fine cap and surrounded with every mark of respect, she was coming downstairs to ‘feed with the service,’ Mme. Villeparisis would stop her to ask after us. And Françoise, when transmitting to us the Marquise’s message: “She said to me, ‘You’ll be sure and bid them good day,’ she said,” counterfeited the voice of Mme. de Villeparisis, whose exact words she imagined herself to be quoting textu-ally, whereas she was really corrupting them no less than Plato corrupts the words of Socrates or Saint John the words of Jesus. Françoise, as was natural, was deeply touched by these attentions. Only she did not believe my grandmother, but supposed that she must be lying in the interest of her class (the rich always combining thus to support one another) when she assured us that Mme. de Villeparisis had been lovely as a young woman. It was true that of this loveliness only the faintest trace remained, from which no one — unless he happened to be a great deal more of an artist than Françoise — would have been able to restore her ruined beauty. For in order to understand how beautiful an elderly woman can once have been one must not only study but interpret every line of her face

    “I must remember, some time, to ask her whether I’m not right, after all, in thinking that there is some connexion with the Guermantes,” said my grandmother, to my great indignation. How could I be expected to believe in a common origin uniting two names which had entered my consciousness, one through the low and shameful gate of experience, the other by the golden gate of imagination?

   We had several times, in the last few days, seen driving past us in a stately equipage, tall, auburn, handsome, with a rather prominent nose, the Princesse de Luxembourg, who was staying in the neighbourhood for a few weeks. Her carriage had stopped outside the hotel, a footman had come in and spoken to the manager, had gone back to the carriage and had reappeared with the most amazing armful of fruit (which combined in a single basket, like the bay itself, different seasons) with a card: “La Princesse de Luxembourg,” on which were scrawled a few words in pencil. For what princely traveller sojourning here incognito, could they be intended, those glaucous plums, luminous and spherical as was at that moment the circumfluent sea, transparent grapes clustering on a shrivelled stick, like a fine day in autumn, pears of a heavenly ultramarine? For it could not be on my grandmother’s friend that the Princess had meant to pay a call. And yet on the following evening Mme. de Villeparisis sent us the bunch of grapes, cool, liquid, golden; plums too and pears which we remembered, though the plums had changed, like the sea at our dinner-hour, to a dull purple, and on the ultramarine surface of the pears there floated the forms of a few rosy clouds. A few days later we met Mme. de Villeparisis as we came away from the symphony concert that was given every morning on the beach. Convinced that the music to which I had been listening (the Prelude to Lohengrin, the Overture to Tannhäuser and suchlike) expressed the loftiest of truths, I was trying to elevate myself, as far as I could, so as to attain to a comprehension of them, I was extracting from myself so as to understand them, and was attributing to them, all that was best and most profound in my own nature at that time

   Well, as we came out of the concert, and, on our way back to the hotel, had stopped for a moment on the ‘front,’ my grandmother and I, for a few words with Mme. de Villeparisis who told us that she had ordered somecroque-monsieurs and a dish of creamed eggs for us at the hotel, I saw, a long way away, coming in our direction, the Princesse de Luxembourg, half leaning upon a parasol in such a way as to impart to her tall and wonderful form that slight inclination, to make it trace that arabesque dear to the women who had been beautiful under the Empire, and knew how, with drooping shoulders, arched backs, concave hips and bent limbs, to make their bodies float as gently as a silken scarf about the rigidity of the invisible stem which might be supposed to have been passed diagonally through them. She went out every morning for a turn on the beach almost at the time when everyone else, after bathing, was climbing home to luncheon, and as hers was not until half past one she did not return to her villa until long after the hungry bathers had left the scorching ‘front’ a desert. Mme. de Villeparisis presented my grandmother and would have presented me, but had first to ask me my name, which she could not remember. She had, perhaps, never known it, or if she had must have forgotten years ago to whom my grandmother had married her daughter. My name, when she did hear it, appeared to impress Mme. de Villeparisis considerably. Meanwhile the Princesse de Luxembourg had given us her hand and, now and again, while she conversed with the Marquise, turned to bestow a kindly glance on my grandmother and myself, with that embryonic kiss which we put into our smiles when they are addressed to a baby out with its ‘Nana.’ Indeed, in her anxiety not to appear to be a denizen of a higher sphere than ours, she had probably miscalculated the distance there was indeed between us, for by an error in adjustment she made her eyes beam with such benevolence that I could see the moment approaching when she would put out her hand and stroke us, as if we were two nice beasts and had poked our heads out at her through the bars of our cage in the Gardens. And, immediately, as it happened, this idea of caged animals and the Bois de Boulogne received striking confirmation. It was the time of day at which the beach is crowded by itinerant and clamorous vendors, hawking cakes and sweets and biscuits. Not knowing quite what to do to shew her affection for us, the Princess hailed the next that came by; he had nothing left but one rye-cake, of the kind one throws to the ducks. The Princess took it and said to me: “For your grandmother.” And yet it was to me that she held it out, saying with a friendly smile, “You shall give it to her yourself!” thinking that my pleasure would thus be more complete if there were no intermediary between myself and the animals. Other vendors came up; she stuffed my pockets with everything that they had, tied up in packets, comfits, sponge-cakes, sugar-sticks. “You will eat some yourself,” she told me, “and give some to your grandmother,” and she had the vendors paid by the little Negro page, dressed in red satin, who followed her everywhere and was a nine days’ wonder upon the beach. Then she said good-bye to Mme. de Villeparisis and held out her hand to us with the intention of treating us in the same way as she treated her friend, as people whom she knew, and of bringing herself within our reach. But this time she must have reckoned our level as not quite so low in the scale of creation, for her and our equality was indicated by the Princess to my grandmother by that tender and maternal smile which a woman gives a little boy when she says good-bye to him as though to a grown-up person. By a miraculous stride in evolution, my grandmother was no longer a duck or an antelope, but had already become what the anglophil Mme. Swann would have called a ‘baby.’ Finally, having taken leave of us all, the Princess resumed her stroll along the basking ‘front,’ curving her splendid shape which, like a serpent coiled about a wand, was interlaced with the white parasol patterned in blue which Mme. de Luxembourg held, unopened, in her hand. She was my first Royalty — I say my first, for strictly speaking Princesse Mathilde did not count. The second, as we shall see in due course, was to astonish me no less by her indulgence. One of the ways in which our great nobles, kindly intermediaries between commoners and kings, can befriend us was revealed to me next day when Mme. de Villeparisis reported: “She thought you quite charming. She is a woman of the soundest judgment, the warmest heart. Not like so many Queens and people! She has real merit.” And Mme. de Villeparisis went on in a tone of conviction, and quite thrilled to be able to say it to us: “I am sure she would be delighted to see you again.”

   But on that previous morning, after we had parted from the Princesse de Luxembourg, Mme. de Villeparisis said a thing which impressed me far more and was not prompted merely by friendly feeling

    “Are you,” she had asked me, “the son of the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry? Indeed! I am told your father is a most charming man. He is having a splendid holiday just now.”

   A few days earlier we had heard, in a letter from Mamma, that my father and his friend M. de Norpois had lost their luggage

    “It has been found; as a matter of fact, it was never really lost, I can tell you what happened,” explained Mme. de Villeparisis, who, without our knowing how, seemed to be far better informed than ourselves of the course of my father’s travels. “I think your father is now planning to come home earlier, next week, in fact, as he will probably give up the idea of going to Algeciras. But he is anxious to devote a day longer to Toledo; it seems, he is an admirer of a pupil of Titian — I forget the name — whose work can only be seen properly there.”

   I asked myself by what strange accident, in the impartial glass through which Mme. de Villeparisis considered, from a safe distance, the bustling, tiny, purposeless agitation of the crowd of people whom she knew, there had come to be inserted at the spot through which she observed rhy father a fragment of prodigious magnifying power which made her see in such high relief and in the fullest detail everything that there was attractive about him, the contingencies that were obliging him to return home, his difficulties with the customs, his admiration for El Greco, and, altering the scale of her vision, shewed her this one man so large among all the rest quite small, like that Jupiter to whom Gustave Moreau gave, when he portrayed him by the side of a weak mortal, a superhuman stature

   My grandmother bade Mme. de Villeparisis good-bye, so that we might stay and imbibe the fresh air for a little while longer outside the hotel, until they signalled to us through the glazed partition that our luncheon was ready. There were sounds of tumult. The young mistress of the King of the Cannibal Island had been down to bathe and was now coming back to the hotel

    “Really and truly, it’s a perfect plague: it’s enough to make one decide to emigrate!” cried the barrister, who had happened to cross her path, in a towering rage

   Meanwhile the solicitor’s wife was following the bogus Queen with eyes that seemed ready to start from their sockets

    “I can’t tell you how angry Mme. Blandais makes me when she stares at those people like that,” said the barrister to the chief magistrate, “I feel I want to slap her. That is just the way to make the wretches appear important; and of course that’s the very thing they want, that people should take an interest in them. Do ask her husband to tell her what a fool she’s making of herself. I swear I won’t go out with them again if they stop and gape at those masqueraders.”

   As to the coming of the Princesse de Luxembourg, whose carriage, on the day on which she left the fruit, had drawn up outside the hotel, it had not passed unobserved by the little group of wives, the solicitor’s, the barrister’s and the magistrate’s, who had for some time past been most concerned to know whether she was a genuine Marquise and not an adventuress, that Mme. de Villeparisis whom everyone treated with so much respect, which all these ladies were burning to hear that she did not deserve. Whenever Mme. de Villeparisis passed through the hall the chief magistrate’s wife, who scented irregularities everywhere, would raise her eyes from her ‘work’ and stare at the intruder in a way that made her friends die of laughter

    “Oh, well, you know,” she explained with lofty condescension, “I always begin by believing the worst. I will never admit that a woman is properly married until she has shewn me her birth certificate and her marriage lines. But there’s no need to alarm yourselves; just wait till I’ve finished my little investigation.”

   And so, day after day the ladies would come together, and, laughingly, ask one another: “Any news?”

   But on the evening after the Princesse de Luxembourg’s call the magistrate’s wife laid a finger on her lips

    “I’ve discovered something.”

    “Oh, isn’t Mme. Poncin simply wonderful? I never saw anyone. . . . But do tell us! What has happened?”

    “Just listen to this. A woman with yellow hair and six inches of paint on her face and a carriage like a — you could smell it a mile off; which only a creature like that would dare to have — came here to-day to call on the Marquise, by way of!”

    “Oh-yow-yow! Tut-tut-tut-tut. Did you ever! Why, it must be that woman we saw — you remember, Leader — we said at the time we didn’t at all like the look of her, but we didn’t know that it was the ‘Marquise’ sheîd come to see. A woman with a nigga-boy, you mean?”

    “That’s the one.”

    “D’you mean to say so? You don’t happen to know her name?”

    “Yes, I made a mistake on purpose; I picked up her card; she tradesunder the name of the ‘Princesse de Luxembourg!’ Wasn’t I right to have my doubts about her? It’s a nice thing to have to mix promiscuously with a Baronne d’Ange like that?” The barrister quoted Mathurin Régnier’sMacette to the chief magistrate

   It must not, however, be supposed that this misunderstanding was merely temporary, like those that occur in the second act of a farce to be cleared up before the final curtain. Mme. de Luxembourg, a niece of the King of England and of the Emperor of Austria, and Mme. de Villeparisis, when one called to take the other for a drive, did look like nothing but two ‘old trots’ of the kind one has always such difficulty in avoiding at a watering place. Nine tenths of the men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain appear to the average man of the middle class simply as alcoholic wasters (which, individually, they not infrequently are) whom, therefore, no respectable person would dream of asking to dinner. The middle class fixes its standard, in this respect, too high, for the feelings of these men would never prevent their being received with every mark of esteem in houses which it, the middle class, may never enter. And so sincerely do they believe that the middle class knows this that they affect a simplicity in speaking of their own affairs and a tone of disparagement of their friends, especially when they are ‘at the coast,’ which make the misunderstanding complete. If, by any chance, a man of the fashionable world is kept in touch with ‘business people’ because, having more money than he knows what to do with, he finds himself elected chairman of all sorts of important financial concerns, the business man who at last sees a nobleman worthy, he considers, to rank with ‘big business,’ would take his oath that such a man can have no dealings with the Marquis ruined by gambling whom the said business man supposes to be all the more destitute of friends the more friendly he makes himself. And he cannot get over his surprise when the Duke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the colossal undertaking, arranges a marriage for his son with the daughter of that very Marquis, who may be a gambler but who bears the oldest name in France, just as a Sovereign would sooner see his son marry the daughter of a dethroned King than that of a President still in office. That is to say, the two worlds take as fantastic! a view of one another as the inhabitants of a town situated at one end of Balbec Bay have of the town at the other end: from Rivebelle you can just see Marcouville l’Orgueilleuse; but even that is deceptive, for you imagine that you are seen from Marcouville, where, as a matter of fact, the splendours of Rive-belle are almost wholly invisible

   The Balbec doctor, who had been called in to cope with a sudden feverish attack, having given the opinion that I ought not to stay out all day on the beach, in the blazing sun, without shelter, and having written out various prescriptions for my use, my grandmother took his prescriptions with a show of respect in which I could at once discern her firm resolve not to have any of them ‘made up,’ but did pay attention to his advice on the matter of hygiene, and accepted an offer from Mme. de Villeparisis to take us for drives in her carriage. After this I would spend the mornings, until luncheon, going to and fro between my own room and my grandmother’s. Hers did not look out directly upon the sea, as mine did, but was lighted from three of its four sides — with views of a strip of the ‘front,’ of a well inside the building, and of the country inland, and was furnished differently from mine, with armchairs upholstered in a metallic tissue with red flowers from which seemed to emanate the cool and pleasant odour that greeted me when I entered the room. And at that hour when the sun’s rays, coming from different aspects and, as it were, from different hours of the day, broke the angles of the wall, thrust in a reflexion of the beach, made of the chest of drawers a festal altar, variegated as a bank of field-flowers, attached to the wall the wings, folded, quivering, warm, of a radiance that would, at any moment, resume its flight, warmed like a bath a square of provincial carpet before the window overlooking the well, which the sun festooned and patterned like a climbing vine, added to the charm and complexity of the room’s furniture by seeming to pluck and scatter the petals of the silken flowers on the chairs, and to make their silver threads stand out from the fabric, this room in which I lingered for a moment before going to get ready for our drive suggested a prism in which the colours of the light that shone outside were broken up, or a hive in which the sweet juices of the day which I was about to taste were distilled, scattered, intoxicating, visible, a garden of hope which dissolved in a quivering haze of silver threads and rose leaves. But before all this I had drawn back my own curtains, impatient to know what Sea it was that was playing that morning by the shore, like a Nereid. For none of those Seas ever stayed with us longer than a day. On the morrow there would be another, which sometimes resembled its predecessor. But I never saw the same one twice

   There were some that were of so rare a beauty that my pleasure on catching sight of them was enhanced by surprise. By what privilege, on one morning rather than another, did the window on being uncurtained disclose to my wondering eyes the nymph Glauconome, whose lazy beauty, gently breathing, had the transparence of a vaporous emerald beneath whose surface I could see teeming the ponderable elements that coloured it? She made the sun join in her play, with a smile rendered languorous by an invisible haze which was nought but a space kept vacant about her translucent surface, which, thus curtailed, became more appealing, like those goddesses whom the sculptor carves in relief upon a block of marble, the rest of which he leaves unchiselled. So, in her matchless colour, she invited us out over those rough terrestrial roads, from which, seated beside Mme. de Villeparisis in her barouche, we should see, all day long and without ever reaching it, the coolness of her gentle palpitation

   Mme. de Villeparisis used to order her carriage early, so that we should have time to reach Saint-Mars le Vêtu, or the rocks of Quetteholme, or some other goal which, for a somewhat lumbering vehicle, was far enough off to require the whole day. In my joy at the long drive we were going to take I would be humming some tune that I had heard recently as I strolled up and down until Mme. de Villeparisis was ready. If it was Sunday hers would not be the only carriage drawn up outside the hotel; several hired flies would be waiting there, not only for the people who had been invited to Féterne by Mme. de Cambremer, but for those who, rather than stay at home all day, like children in disgrace, declared that Sunday was always quite impossible at Balbec and started off immediately after luncheon to hide themselves in some neighbouring watering-place or to visit one of the ‘sights’ of the district. And indeed whenever (which was often) anyone asked Mme. Blandais if she had been to the Cambremers’, she would answer peremptorily: “No; we went to the Falls of the Bee,” as though that were the sole reason for her not having spent the day at Féteme. And the barrister would be charitable, and say:

    “I envy you. I wish I had gone there instead; they must be well worth seeing.”

   Beside the row of carriages, in front of the porch in which I stood waiting, was planted, like some shrub of a rare species, a young page who attracted the eye no less by the unusual and effective colouring of his hair than by his plant-like epidermis. Inside, in the hall, corresponding to the narthex, or Church of the Catechumens in a primitive basilica, through which persons who were not staying in the hotel were entitled to pass, the comrades of this ‘outside’ page did not indeed work much harder than he but did at least execute certain drilled movements. It is probable that in the early morning they helped with the cleaning. But in the afternoon they stood there only like a Chorus who, even when there is nothing for them to do, remain upon the stage in order to strengthen the cast. The General Manager, the same who had so terrified me, reckoned on increasing their number considerably next year, for he had ‘big ideas.’ And this prospect greatly afflicted the manager of the hotel, who found that all these boys about the place only ‘created a nuisance,’ by which he meant that they got in the visitors’ way and were of no use to anyone. But between luncheon and dinner at least, between the exits and entrances of the visitors, they did fill an otherwise empty stage, like those pupils of Mme. de Maintenon who, in the garb of young Israelites, carry on the action whenever Esther or Joad ‘goes off.’ But the outside page, with his delicate tints, his tall, slender, fragile trunk, in proximity to whom I stood waiting for the Marquise to come downstairs, preserved an immobility into which a certain melancholy entered, for his elder brothers had left the hotel for more brilliant careers elsewhere, and he felt keenly his isolation upon this alien soil. At last Mme. de Villeparisis appeared. To stand by her carriage and to help her into it ought perhaps to have been part of the young page’s duties. But he knew on the one hand that a person who brings her own servants to an hotel expects them to wait on her and is not as a rule lavish with her ‘tips,’ and that generally speaking this was true also of the nobility of the old Faubourg Saint-Germain. Mme. de Villeparisis was included in both these categories. The arborescent page concluded therefore that he need expect nothing from her, and leaving her own maid and footman to pack her and her belongings into the carriage, he continued to dream sadly of the enviable lot of his brothers and preserved his vegetable immobility

   We would start off; some time after rounding the railway station, we came into a country road which soon became as familiar to me as the roads round Combray, from the bend where, like a fish-hook, it was baited with charming orchards, to the turning at which we left it, with tilled fields upon either side. Among these we could see here and there an apple-tree, stripped it was true of its blossom, and bearing no more now than a fringe of pistils, but sufficient even so to enchant me since I could imagine, seeing those inimitable leaves, how their broad expanse, like the ceremonial carpet spread for a wedding that was now over, had been but the other day swept by the white satin train of their blushing flowers

   How often in Paris, during the May of the following year, was I to bring home a branch of apple-blossom from the florist, and to stay all night long before its flowers in which bloomed the same creamy essence that powdered besides and whitened the green unfolding leaves, flowers between whose snowy cups it seemed almost as though it had been the salesman who had, in his generosity towards myself, out of his wealth of invention too and as an effective contrast, added on either side the supplement of a becoming crimson bud: I sat gazing at them, I grouped them in the light of my lamp — for so long that I was often still there when the dawn brought to their whiteness the same flush with which it must at that moment have been tingeing their sisters on the Balbec road — and I sought to carry them back in my imagination to that roadside, to multiply them, to spread them out, so as to fill the frame prepared for them, on the canvas, all ready, of those closes the outline of which I knew by heart, which I so longed to see — which one day I must see again, at the moment when, with the exquisite fervour of genius, spring was covering their canvas with its colours

   Before getting into the carriage I had composed the seascape for which I was going to look out, which I had hoped to see with the ‘sun radiant’ upon it, and which at Balbec I could distinguish only in too fragmentary a form, broken by so many vulgar intromissions that had no place in my dream, bathers, dressing-boxes, pleasure yachts. But when, Mme. de Ville-parisis’s carriage having reached high ground, I caught a glimpse of the sea through the leafy boughs of trees, then no doubt at such a distance those temporal details which had set the sea, as it were, apart from nature and history disappeared, and I could as I looked down towards its waves make myself realise that they were the same which Leconte de Lisle describes for us in his Orestie, where “like a flight of birds of prey, before the dawn of day” the long-haired warriors of heroic Hellas “with oars an hundred thousand sweep the huge resounding deep.” But on the other hand I was no longer near enough to the sea which seemed to me not a living thing now, but fixed; I no longer felt any power beneath its colours, spread like those of a picture among the leaves, through which it appeared as inconsistent as the sky and only of an intenser blue

   Mme. de Villeparisis, seeing that I was fond of churches, promised me that we should visit one one day and another another, and especially the church at Carqueville ‘quite buried in all its old ivy,’ as she said with a wave of the hand which seemed tastefully to be clothing the absent ‘front’ in an invisible and delicate screen of foliage. Mme. de Villeparisis would often, with this little descriptive gesture, find just the right word to define the attraction and the distinctive features of an historic building, always avoiding technical terms, but incapable of concealing her thorough understanding of the things to which she referred. She appeared to seek an excuse for this erudition in the fact that one of her father’s country houses, the one in which she had lived as a girl, was situated in a district in which there were churches similar in style to those round Balbec, so that it would have been unaccountable if she had not acquired a taste for architecture, this house being, incidentally, one of the finest examples of that of the Renaissance. But as it was also a regular museum, as moreover Chopin and Liszt had played there, Lamartine recited poetry, all the most famous artists for fully a century inscribed ‘sentiments,’ scored melodies, made sketches in the family album, Mme. de Villeparisis ascribed, whether from delicacy, good breeding, true modesty or want of intelligence, only this purely material origin to her acquaintance with all the arts, and had come, apparently, to regard painting, music, literature and philosophy as the appanage of a young lady brought up on the most aristocratic lines in an historic building that was catalogued and starred. You would have said, listening to her, that she knew of no pictures that were not heirlooms. She was pleased that my grandmother liked a necklace which she wore, and which fell over her dress. It appeared in the portrait of an ancestress of her own by Titian which had never left the family. So that one could be certain of its being genuine. She would not listen to a word about pictures bought, heaven knew where, by a Croesus, she was convinced before you spoke that they were forgeries, and had so desire to see them. We knew that she herself painted flowers in water-colour, and my grandmother, who had heard these praised, spoke to her of them. Mme. de Villeparisis modestly changed the subject, but without shewing either surprise or pleasure more than would an artist whose reputation was established and to whom compliments meant nothing. She said merely that it was a delightful pastime because, even if the flowers that sprang from the brush were nothing wonderful, at least the work made you live in the company of real flowers, of the beauty of which, especially when you were obliged to study them closely in order to draw them, you could never grow tired. But at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis was giving herself a holiday, so as to spare her eyes

   We were astonished, my grandmother and I, to find how much more ‘Liberal’ she was than even the majority of the middle class. She did not understand how anyone could be scandalised by the expulsion of the Jesuits, saying that it had always been done, even under the Monarchy, in Spain even. She took up the defence of the Republic, and against its anti-clericalism had not more to say than: “I should be equally annoyed whether they prevented me from hearing mass when I wanted to, or forced me to hear it when I didn’t!” and even startled us with such utterances as: “Oh! the aristocracy in these days, what does it amount to?” “To my mind, a man who doesn’t work doesn’t count!”— perhaps only because she felt that they gained point and flavour, became memorable, in fact, on her lips

   When we heard these advanced opinions — though never so far advanced as to amount to Socialism, which Mme. de Villeparisis held in abhorrence — expressed so frequently and with so much frankness precisely by one of those people in consideration of whose intelligence our scrupulous and timid impartiality would refuse to condemn outright the ideas of the Conservatives, we came very near, my grandmother and I, to believing that in the pleasant companion of our drives was to be found the measure and the pattern of truth in all things. We took her word for it when she appreciated her Titians, the colonnade of her country house, the conversational talent of Louis-Philippe. But — like those mines of learning who hold us spellbound when we get them upon Egyptian paintings or Etruscan inscriptions, and yet talk so tediously about modern work that we ask ourselves whether we have not been over-estimating the interest of the sciences in which they are versed since there is not apparent in their treatment of them the mediocrity of mind which they must have brought to those studies just as much as to their fatuous essays on Baudelaire — Mme. de Villeparisis, questioned by me about Chateaubriand, about Balzac, about Victor Hugo, each of whom had in his day been the guest of her parents, and had been seen and spoken to by her, smiled at my reverence, told amusing anecdotes of them, such as she had a moment ago been telling us of dukes and statesmen, and severely criticised those writers simply because they had been lacking in that modesty, that self-effacement, that sober art which is satisfied with a single right line, and lays no stress on it, which avoids more than anything else the absurdity of grandiloquence, in that opportuneness, those qualities of moderation, of judgment and simplicity to which she had been taught that real greatness aspired and attained: it was evident that she had no hesitation in placing above them men who might after all, perhaps, by virtue of those qualities, have had the advantage of a Balzac, a Hugo, a Vigny in a drawing-room, an academy, a cabinet council, men like Mole, Fontanes, Vitroles, Bersot, Pasquier, Lebrun, Salvandy or Daru

    “Like those novels of Stendhal, which you seem to admire. You would have given him a great surprise, I assure you, if you had spoken to him in that tone. My father, who used to meet him at M. Mérimée’s — now he was a man of talent, if you like — often told me that Beyle (that was his real name) was appallingly vulgar, but quite good company at dinner, and never in the least conceited about his books. Why, you can see for yourself how he just shrugged his shoulders at the absurdly extravagant compliments of M. de Balzac. There at least he shewed that he knew how to behave like a gentleman.” She possessed the autographs of all these great men, and seemed, when she put forward the personal relations which her family had had with them, to assume that her judgment of them must be better founded than that of young people who, like myself, had had no opportunity of meeting them. “I’m sure I have a right to speak, for they used to come to my father’s house; and as M. Sainte-Beuve, who was a most intelligent man, used to say, in forming an estimate you must take the word of people who saw them close, and were able to judge more exactly of their real worth.”

   Sometimes as the carriage laboured up a steep road through tilled country, making the fields more real, adding to them a mark of authenticity like the precious flower with which certain of the old masters used to sign their pictures, a few hesitating cornflowers, like the Combray cornflowers, would stream in our wake. Presently the horses outdistanced them, but a little way on we would catch sight of another which while it stayed our coming had pricked up to welcome us amid the grass its azure star; some made so bold as to come and plant themselves by the side of the road, and the impression left in my mind was a nebulous blend of distant memories and of wild flowers grown tame

   We began to go down hill; and then met, climbing on foot, on a bicycle, in a cart or carriage, one of those creatures — flowers of a fine day but unlike the flowers of the field, for each of them secretes something that is not to be found in another, with the result that we can never satisfy upon any of her fellows the desire which she has brought to birth in us — a farm-girl driving her cow or half-lying along a waggon, a shopkeeper’s daughter taking the air, a fashionable young lady erect on the back seat of a landau, facing her parents. Certainly Bloch had been the means of opening a new era and had altered the value of life for me on the day when he had told me that the dreams which I had entertained on my solitary walks along the Méséglise way, when I hoped that some peasant girl might pass whom I could take in my arms, were not a mere fantasy which corresponded to nothing outside myself, but that all the girls one met, whether villagers or ‘young ladies,’ were alike ready and willing to give ear to such prayers. And even if I were fated, now that I was ill and did not go out by myself, never to be able to make love to them, I was happy all the same, like a child born in a prison or a hospital, who, having always supposed that the human organism was capable of digesting only dry bread and ‘physic,’ has learned suddenly that peaches, apricots and grapes are not simply part of the decoration of the country scene but delicious and easily assimilated food. Even if his gaoler or his nurse does not allow him to pluck those tempting fruits, still the world seems to him a better place and existence in it more clement. For a desire seems to us more attractive, we repose on it with more confidence, when we know that outside ourselves there is a reality which conforms to it, even if, for us, it is not to be realised. And we think with more joy of a life in which (on condition that we eliminate for a moment from our mind the tiny obstacle, accidental and special, which prevents us personally from doing so) we can imagine ourself to be assuaging that desire. As to the pretty girls who went past, from the day on which I had first known that their cheeks could be kissed, I had become curious about their souls. And the universe had appeared to me more interesting

   Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage moved fast. Scarcely had I time to see the girl who was coming in our direction; and yet — as the beauty of people is not like the beauty of things, as we feel that it is that of an unique creature, endowed with consciousness and free-will — as soon as her individuality, a soul still vague, a will unknown to me, presented a tiny picture of itself, enormously reduced but complete, in the depths of her indifferent eyes, at once, by a mysterious response of the pollen ready in me for the pistils that should receive it, I felt surging through me the embryo, as vague, as minute, of the desire not to let this girl pass without forcing her mind to become conscious of my person, without preventing her desires from wandering to some one else, without coming to fix myself in her dreams and to seize and occupy her heart. Meanwhile our carriage rolled away from her, the pretty girl was already left behind, and as she had — of me — none of those notions which constitute a person in one’s mind, her eyes which had barely seen me had forgotten me already. Was it because I had caught but a fragmentary glimpse of her that I had found her so attractive? It may have been. In the first place, the impossibility of stopping when I came to her, the risk of not meeting her again another day, give at once to such a girl the same charm as a place derives from the illness or poverty that prevents us from visiting it, or the so unadventurous days through which we should otherwise have to live from the battle in which we shall doubtless fall. So that, if there were no such thing as habit, life must appear delightful to those of us who would at every moment be threatened with death — that is to say, to all mankind. Then, if our imagination is set going by the desire for what we may not possess, its flight is not limited by a reality completely perceived, in these casual encounters in which the charms of the passing stranger are generally in direct ratio to the swiftness of our passage. If only night is falling and the carriage is moving fast, whether in town or country, there is not a female torso, mutilated like an antique marble by the speed that tears us away and the dusk that drowns it, but aims at our heart, from every turning in the road, from the lighted interior of every shop, the arrows of Beauty, that Beauty of which we are sometimes tempted to ask ourselves whether it is, in this world, anything more than the complementary part that is added to a fragmentary and fugitive stranger by our imagination over-stimulated by regret

   Had I been free to stop, to get down from the carriage and to speak to the girl whom we were passing, should I perhaps have been disillusioned by some fault in her complexion which from the carriage I had not distinguished? (After which every effort to penetrate into her life would have seemed suddenly impossible. For beauty is a sequence of hypotheses which ugliness cuts short when it bars the way that we could already see opening into the unknown.) Perhaps a single word which she might have uttered, a smile, would have furnished me with a key, a clue that I had not expected, to read the expression of her face, to interpret her bearing, which would at once have ceased to be of any interest. It is possible, for I have never in real life met any girls so desirable as on days when I was with some serious person from whom, despite the — myriad pretexts that I invented, I could not tear myself away: some years after that in which I went for the first time to Balbec, as I was driving through Paris with a friend of my father, and had caught sight of a woman walking quickly along the dark street, I felt that it was unreasonable to forfeit, for a purely conventional scruple, my share of happiness in what may very well be the only life there is, and jumping from the carriage without a word of apology I followed in quest of the stranger; lost her where two streets crossed; caught her up again in a third, and arrived at last, breathless, beneath a street lamp, face to face with old Mme. Verdurin whom I had been carefully avoiding for years, and who, in her delight and surprise, exclaimed: “But how very nice of you to have run all this way just to say how d’ye do to me!”

   That year at Balbec, at the moments of such encounters, I would assure my grandmother and Mme. de Villeparisis that I had so severe a headache that the best thing for me would be to go home alone on foot. But they would never let me get out of the carriage. And I must add that pretty girl (far harder to find again than an historic building, for she was nameless and had the power of locomotion) to the collection of all those whom I promised myself that I would examine more closely at a later date. One of them, however, happened to pass more than once before my eyes in circumstances which allowed me to believe that I should be able to get to know her when I chose. This was a milk-girl who came from a farm with an additional supply of cream for the hotel. I fancied that she had recognised me also; and she did, in fact, look at me with an attentiveness which was perhaps due only to the surprise which my attentiveness caused her. And next day, a day on which I had been resting all morning, when Françoise came in about noon to draw my curtains, she handed me a letter which had been left for me downstairs. I knew no one at Balbec. I had no doubt that the letter was from the milk-girl. Alas, it was only from Bergotte who, as he happened to be passing, had tried to see me, but on hearing that I was asleep had scribbled a few charming lines for which the lift-boy had addressed an envelope which I had supposed to have been written by the milk-girl. I was bitterly disappointed, and the thought that it was more difficult, and more flattering to myself to get a letter from Bergotte did not in the least console me for this particular letter’s not being from her. As for the girl, I never came across her again any more than I came across those whom I had seen only from Mme. de Ville-parisis’s carriage. Seeing and then losing them all thus increased the state of agitation in which I was living, and I found a certain wisdom in the philosophers who recommend us to set a limit to our desires (if, that is, they refer to our desire for people, for that is the only kind that ends in anxiety, having for its object a being at once unknown and unconscious. To suppose that philosophy could refer to the desire for wealth would be too silly.). At the same time I was inclined to regard this wisdom as incomplete, for I said to myself that these encounters made me find even more beautiful a world which thus caused to grow along all the country roads flowers at once rare and common, fleeting treasures of the day, windfalls of the drive, of which the contingent circumstances that would never, perhaps, recur had alone prevented me from taking advantage, and which gave a new zest to life

   But perhaps in hoping that, one day, with greater freedom, I should be able to find on other roads girls much the same, I was already beginning to falsify and corrupt what there is exclusively individual in the desire to live in the company of a woman whom one has found attractive, and by the mere fact that I admitted the possibility of making this desire grow artificially, I had implicitly acknowledged my allusion

   The day on which Mme. de Villeparisis took us to Carqueville, where there was that church, covered in ivy, of which she had spoken to us, a church that, built upon rising ground, dominated both its village and the river that flowed beneath it, and had kept its own little bridge from the middle ages, my grandmother, thinking that I would like to be left alone to study the building at my leisure, suggested to her friend that they should go on and wait for me at the pastry-cook’s, in the village square which was clearly visible from where we were and, in its mellow bloom in the sunshine, seemed like another part of a whole that was all mediaeval. It was arranged that I should join them there later. In the mass of verdure before which I was left standing I was obliged, if I was to discover the church, to make a mental effort which involved my grasping more intensely the idea ‘Church’; in fact, as happens to schoolboys who gather more fully the meaning of a sentence when they are made, by translating or by paraphrasing it, to divest it of the forms to which they are accustomed, this idea of ‘Church,’ which as a rule I scarcely needed when I stood beneath steeples that were recognisable in themselves, I was obliged perpetually to recall so as not to forget, here that the arch in this clump of ivy was that of a pointed window, there that the projection of the leaves was due to the swelling underneath of a capital. Then came a breath of wind, and sent a tremor through the mobile porch, which was overrun by eddies that shot and quivered like a flood of light; the pointed leaves opened one against another; and, shuddering, the arboreal front drew after it green pillars, undulant, caressed and fugitive

   As I came away from the church I saw by the old bridge a cluster of girls from the village who, probably because it was Sunday, were standing about in their best clothes, rallying the young men who went past. Not so well dressed as the others, but seeming to enjoy some ascendancy over them — for she scarcely answered when they spoke to her — with a more serious and a more determined air, there was a tall one who, hoisted upon the parapet of the bridge with her feet hanging down, was holding on her lap a small vessel full of fish which she had presumably just been catching. She had a tanned complexion, gentle eyes but with a look of contempt for her surroundings, a small nose, delicately and attractively modelled. My eyes rested upon her skin; and my lips, had the need arisen, might have believed that they had followed my eyes. But it was not only to her body that I should have liked to attain, there was also her person, which abode within her, and with which there is but one form of contact, namely to attract its attention, but one sort of penetration, to awaken an idea in it

   And this inner self of the charming fisher-girl seemed to be still closed to me, I was doubtful whether I had entered it, even after I had seen my own image furtively reflect itself in the twin mirrors of her gaze, following an index of refraction that was as unknown to me as if I had been placed in the field of vision of a deer. But just as it would not have sufficed that my lips should find pleasure in hers without giving pleasure to them also, so I should have wished that the idea of me which was to enter this creature, was to fasten itself in her, should attract to me not merely her attention but her admiration, her desire, and should compel her to keep me in her memory until the day when I should be able to meet her again. Meanwhile I could see, within a stone’s-throw, the square in which Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage must be waiting for me. I had not a moment to lose; and already I could feel that the girls were beginning to laugh at the sight of me thus held suspended before them. I had a five-franc piece in my pocket. I drew it out, and, before explaining to the girl the errand on which I proposed to send her, so as to have a better chance of her listening to me, I held the coin for a moment before her eyes

    “Since you seem to belong to the place,” I said to her, “I wonder if you would be so good as to take a message for me. I want you to go to a pastrycook’s — which is apparently in a square, but I don’t know where that is — where there is a carriage waiting for me. One moment! To make quite sure, will you ask if the carriage belongs to the Marquise de Villeparisis? But you can’t miss it; it’s a carriage and pair.”

   That was what I wished her to know, so that she should regard me as someone of importance. But when I had uttered the words ‘Marquise’ and ‘carriage and pair,’ suddenly I had a great sense of calm. I felt that the fisher-girl would remember me, and I felt vanishing, with my fear of not being able to meet her again, part also of my desire to meet her. It seemed to me that I had succeeded in touching her person with invisible lips, and that I had pleased her. And this assault and capture of her mind, this immaterial possession had taken from her part of her mystery, just as physical possession does

   We came down towards Hudimesnil; suddenly I was overwhelmed with that profound happiness which I had not often felt since Combray; happiness analogous to that which had been given me by — among other things — the steeples of Martinville. But this time it remained incomplete. I had just seen, standing a little way back from the steep ridge over which we were passing, three trees, probably marking the entrance to a shady avenue, which made a pattern at which I was looking now not for the first time; I could not succeed in reconstructing the place from which they had been, as it were, detached, but I felt that it had been familiar to me once; so that my mind having wavered between some distant year and the present moment, Balbec and its surroundings began to dissolve and I asked myself whether the whole of this drive were not a make-believe, Balbec a place to which I had never gone save in imagination, Mme. de Villeparisis a character in a story and the three old trees the reality which one recaptures on raising one’s eyes from the book which one has been reading and which describes an environment into which one has come to believe that one has been bodily transported

   I looked at the three trees; I could see them plainly, but my mind felt that they were concealing something which it had not grasped, as when things are placed out of our reach, so that our fingers, stretched out at arm’s-length, can only touch for a moment their outer surface, and can take hold of nothing. Then we rest for a little while before thrusting out our arm with refreshed vigour, and trying to reach an inch or two farther. But if my mind was thus to collect itself, to gather strength, I should have to be alone. What would I not have given to be able to escape as I used to do on those walks along the Guermantes way, when I detached myself from my parents! It seemed indeed that I ought to do so now. I recognised that kind of pleasure which requires, it is true, a certain effort on the part of the mind, but in comparison with which the attractions of the inertia which inclines us to renounce that pleasure seem very slight. That pleasure, the object of which I could but dimly feel, that pleasure which I must create for myself, I experienced only on rare occasions, but on each of these it seemed to me that the things which had happened in the interval were of but scant importance, and that in attaching myself to the reality of that pleasure alone I could at length begin to lead a new life. I laid my hand for a moment across my eyes, so as to be able to shut them without Mme. de Villeparisis’s noticing. I sat there, thinking of nothing, then with my thoughts collected, compressed and strengthened I sprang farther forward in the direction of the trees, or rather in that inverse direction at the end of which I could see them growing within myself. I felt again behind them the same object, known to me and yet vague, which I could not bring nearer. And yet all three of them, as the carriage moved on, I could see coming towards me. Where had I looked at them before? There was no place near Combray where an avenue opened off the road like that. The site which they recalled to me, there was no room for it either in the scenery of the place in Germany where I had gone one year with my grandmother to take the waters. Was I to suppose, then, that they came from years already so remote in my life that the landscape which accompanied them had been entirely obliterated from my memory, and that, like the pages which, with sudden emotion, we recognise in a book which we imagined that we had never read, they surged up by themselves out of the forgotten chapter of my earliest infancy? Were they not rather to be numbered among those dream landscapes, always the same, at least for me in whom their unfamiliar aspect was but the objectivation in my dreams of the effort that I had been making while awake either to penetrate the mystery of a place beneath the outward appearance of which I was dimly conscious of there being something more, as had so often happened to me on the Guermantes way, or to succeed in bringing mystery back to a place which I had longed to know and which, from the day on which I had come to know it, had seemed to me to be wholly superficial, like Balbec? Or were they but an image freshly extracted from a dream of the night before, but already so worn, so altered that it seemed to me to come from somewhere far more distant? Or had I indeed never seen them before; did they conceal beneath their surface, like the trees, like the tufts of grass that I had seen beside the Guermantes way, a meaning as obscure, as hard to grasp as is a distant past, so that, whereas they are pleading with me that I would master a new idea, I imagined that I had to identify something in my memory? Or again were they concealing no hidden thought, and was it simply my strained vision that made me see them double in time as one occasionally sees things double in space? I could not tell. And yet all the time they were coming towards me; perhaps some fabulous apparition, a ring of witches or of norns who would propound their oracles to me. I chose rather to believe that they were phantoms of the past, dear companions of my childhood, vanished friends who recalled our common memories. Like ghosts they seemed to be appealing to me to take them with me, to bring them back to life. In their simple, passionate gesticulation I could discern the helpless anguish of a beloved person who has lost the power of speech, and feels that he will never be able to say to us what he wishes to say and we can never guess. Presently, at a cross-roads, the carriage left them. It was bearing me away from what alone I believed to be true, what would have made me truly happy; it was like my life

   I watched the trees gradually withdraw, waving their despairing arms, seeming to say to me: “What you fail to learn from us to-day, you will never know. If you allow us to drop back into the hollow of this road from which we sought to raise ourselves up to you, a whole part of yourself which we were bringing to you will fall for ever into the abyss.” And indeed if, in the course of time, I did discover the kind of pleasure and of disturbance which I had just been feeling once again, and if one evening — too late, but then for all time — I fastened myself to it, of those trees themselves I was never to know what they had been trying to give me nor where else I had seen them. And when, the road having forked and the carriage with it, I turned my back on them and ceased to see them, with Mme. de Villeparisis asking me what I was dreaming about, I was as wretched as though I had just lost a friend, had died myself, had broken faith with the dead or had denied my God

   It was time to be thinking of home. Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a certain feeling for nature, colder than that of my grandmother but capable of recognising, even outside museums and noblemen’s houses, the simple and majestic beauty of certain old and venerable things, told her coachman to take us back by the old Balbec road, a road little used but planted with old elm-trees which we thought quite admirable

   Once we had got to know this road, for a change we would return — that is, if we had not taken it on the outward journey — by another which ran through the woods of Chantereine and Canteloup. The invisibility of the numberless birds that took up one another’s song close beside us in the trees gave me the same sense of being at rest that one has when one shuts one’s eyes. Chained to my back-seat like Prometheus on his rock I listened to my Oceanides. And when it so happened that I caught a glimpse of one of those birds as it passed from one leaf to another, there was so little apparent connexion between it and the songs that I heard that I could not believe that I was beholding their cause in that little body, fluttering, startled and unseeing

   This road was like many others of the same kind which are to be found in France, climbing on a fairly steep gradient to its summit and then gradually falling for the rest of the way. At the time, I found no great attraction in it, I was only glad to be going home. But it became for me later on a frequent source of joy by remaining in my memory as a lodestone to which all the similar roads that I was to take, on walks or drives or journeys, would at once attach themselves without breach of continuity and would be able, thanks to it, to communicate directly with my heart. For as soon as the carriage or the motor-car turned into one of these roads that seemed to be merely the continuation of the road along which I had driven with Mme. de Villeparisis, the matter to which I found my consciousness directly applying itself, as to the most recent event in my past, would be (all the intervening years being quietly obliterated) the impressions that I had had on those bright summer afternoons and evenings, driving round Balbec, when the leaves smelt good, a mist rose from the ground, and beyond the village close at hand one could see through the trees the sun setting as though it had been merely some place farther along the road, a forest place and distant, which we should not have time to reach that evening. Harmonised with what I was feeling now in another place, on a similar road, surrounded by all the accessory sensations of breathing deep draughts of air, of curiosity, indolence, appetite, lightness of heart which were common to them both, and excluding all others, these impressions would be reinforced, would take on the consistency of a particular type of pleasure, and almost of a setting of life which, as it happened, I rarely had the luck to-come across, but in which these awakened memories placed, amid the reality that my senses could perceive, no small part of a reality suggested, dreamed, unseizable, to give me, among those regions through which I was passing, more than an aesthetic feeling, a transient but exalted ambition to stay there and to live there always. How often since then, simply because I could smell green leaves, has not being seated on a backseat opposite Mme. de Villeparisis, meeting the Princesse de Luxembourg who waved a greeting to her from her own carriage, coming back to dinner at the Grand Hotel appeared to me as one of those indescribable happinesses which neither the present nor the future can restore to us, which we may taste once only in a lifetime

   Often dusk would have fallen before we reached the hotel. Timidly I would quote to Mme. de Villeparisis, pointing to the moon in the sky, some memorable expression of Chateaubriand or Vigny or Victor Hugo: ‘Shedding abroad that ancient secret of melancholy’ or ‘Weeping like Diana by the brink of her streams’ or ‘The shadows nuptial, solemn and august.’

    “And so you think that good, do you?” she would ask, “inspired, as you call it. I must confess that I am always surprised to see people taking things seriously nowadays which the friends of those gentlemen, while doing ample justice to their merits, were the first to laugh at. People weren’t so free then with the word ‘inspired’ as they are now, when if you say to a writer that he has mere talent he thinks you’re insulting him. You quote me a fine passage from M. de Chateaubriand about moonlight. You shall see that I have my own reasons for being refractory. M. de Chateaubriand used constantly to come to see my father. He was quite a pleasant person when you were alone with him, because then he was simple and amusing, but the moment he had an audience he would begin to pose, and then he became absurd; when my father was in the room, he pretended that he had flung his resignation in the King’s face, and that he had controlled the voting in the Conclave, forgetting that it was my father whom he had asked to beg the King to take him back, and that my father had heard him make the most idiotic forecasts of the Papal election. You ought to have heard M. de Blacas on that famous Conclave; he was a very different kind of man from M. de Chateaubriand. As to his fine phrases about the moon, they became part of our regular programme for entertaining our guests. Whenever there was any moonlight about the house, if there was anyone staying with us for the first time he would be told to take M. de Chateaubriand for a stroll after dinner. When they came in, my father would take his guest aside and say: ‘Well, and was M. de Chateaubriand very eloquent?’—‘Oh, yes.’ ‘He’s been talking about the moon?’—‘Yes, how did you know?’—‘One moment, didn’t he say ——’ and then my father would quote the passage. ‘He did; but how in the world . . .?’—‘And he spoke to you of the moonlight on the Roman Campagna?’—‘But, my dear sir, you’re a magician.’ My father was no magician, but M. de Chateaubriand had the same little speech about the moon which he served up every time.”

   At the mention of Vigny she laughed: “The man who said: ‘I am the Comte Alfred de Vigny!’ One either is a Comte or one isn’t; it is not of the slightest importance.” And then perhaps she discovered that it was after all, of some slight importance, for she went on: “For one thing I am by no means sure that he was, and in any case he was of the humblest origin, that gentleman who speaks in his verses of his ‘Esquire’s crest.’ In such charming taste, is it not, and so interesting to his readers! Like Musset, a plain Paris cit, who laid so much stress on ‘The golden falcon that surmounts my helm.’ As if you would ever hear a real gentleman say a thing like that! And yet Musset had some talent as a poet. But except Cinq-Mars I have never been able to read a thing by M. de Vigny. I get so bored that the book falls from my hands. M. Mole, who had all the cleverness and tact that were wanting in M. de Vigny, put him properly in his place when he welcomed him to the Academy. Do you mean to say you don’t know the speech? It is a masterpiece of irony and impertinence.” She found fault with Balzac, whom she was surprised to see her nephews admire, for having pretended to describe a society ‘in which he was never received’ and of which his descriptions were wildly improbable. As for Victor Hugo, she told us that M. de Bouillon, her father, who had friends among the young leaders of the Romantic movement, had been taken by some of them to the first performance of Hernani, but that he had been unable to sit through it, so ridiculous had he found the lines of that talented but extravagant writer who had acquired the title of ‘Major Poet’ only by virtue of having struck a bargain, and as a reward for the not disinterested indulgence that he shewed to the dangerous errors of the Socialists

   We had now come in sight of the hotel, with its lights, so hostile that first evening, on our arrival, now protecting and kind, speaking to us of home. And when the carriage drew up outside the door, the porter, the pages, the lift-boy, attentive, clumsy, vaguely uneasy at our lateness, were numbered, now that they had grown familiar, among those beings who change so many times in the course of our life, as we ourself change, but by whom, when they are for the time being the mirror of our habits, we find something attractive in the feeling that we are being faithfully reflected and in a friendly spirit. We prefer them to friends whom we have not seen for some time, for they contain more of what we actually are. Only the outside page, exposed to the sun all day, had been taken indoors for protection from the cold night air and swaddled in thick woollen garments which, combined with the orange effulgence of his locks and the curiously red bloom of his cheeks, made one, seeing him there through the glass front of the hall, think of a hot-house plant muffled up for protection from the frost. We got out of the carriage, with the help of a great many more servants than were required, but they were conscious of the importance of the scene and each felt obliged to take some part in it. I was always very hungry. And so, often, so as not to keep dinner waiting, I would not go upstairs first to the room which had succeeded in becoming so really mine that to catch sight of its long violet curtains and low bookcases was to find myself alone again with that self of which things, like people, gave me a reflected image; but we would all wait together in the hall until the head waiter came to tell us that our dinner was ready. And this gave us another opportunity of listening to Mme. de Villeparisis

    “But you must be tired of us by now,” protested my grandmother

    “Not at all! Why, I am delighted, what could be nicer?” replied her friend with a winning smile, drawing out, almost intoning her words in a way that contrasted markedly with her customary simplicity of speech

   And indeed at such moments as this she was not natural, her mind reverted to her early training, to the aristocratic manner in which a great lady is supposed to shew common people that she is glad to see them, that she is not at all stiff. And her one and only failure in true politeness lay in this excess of politeness; which it was easy to identify as one of the professional ‘wrinkles’ of a lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, who, always seeing in her humbler friends the latent discontent that she must one day arouse in their bosoms, greedily seizes every opportunity en which she can possibly, in the ledger in which she keeps her social account with them, write down a credit balance which will allow her to enter presently on the opposite page the dinner or reception to which she will not invite them. And so, having long ago taken effect in her once and for all, and ignoring the fact that now both the circumstances and the people concerned were different, that in Paris she hoped to see us often come to her house, the spirit of her caste was urging Mme. de Villeparisis on with feverish ardour, and as if the time that was allowed her for being kind to us was limited, to multiply, while we were still at Balbec, her gifts of roses and melons, loans of books, drives in her carriage and verbal effusions. And for that reason, quite as much as the dazzling glories of the beach, the many-coloured flamboyance and subaqueous light of the rooms, as much even as the riding-lessons by which tradesmen’s sons were deified like Alexander of Macedon, the daily kindnesses shewn us by Mme. de Villeparisis and also the unaccustomed, momentary, holiday ease with which my grandmother accepted them have remained in my memory as typical of life at a watering-place

    “Give them your cloaks to take upstairs.”

   My grandmother handed hers to the manager, and because he had been so nice to me I was distressed by this want of consideration, which seemed to pain him

    “I think you’ve hurt his feelings,” said the Marquise. “He probably fancies himself too great a gentleman to carry your wraps. I remember so well the Duc de Nemours, when I was still quite little, coming to see my father who was living then on the top floor of the Bouillon house, with a fat parcel under his arm of letters and newspapers. I can see the Prince now, in his blue coat, framed in our doorway, which had such pretty woodwork round it — I think it was Bagard made it — you know those fine laths that they used to cut, so supple that the joiner would twist them sometimes into little shells and flowers, like the ribbons round a nosegay. ‘Here you are, Cyrus,’ he said to my father, ‘look what your porter’s given me to bring you. He said to me: “Since you’re going up to see the Count, it’s not worth my while climbing all those stairs; but take care you don’t break the string.”’ Now that you have got rid of your things, why don’t you sit down; look, sit in this seat,” she said to my grandmother, taking her by the hand

    “Oh, if you don’t mind, not in that one! There is not room for two, and it’s too big for me by myself; I shouldn’t feel comfortable.”

    “You remind me, for it was exactly like this, of a seat that I had for many years until at last I couldn’t keep it any longer because it had been given to my mother by the poor Duchesse de Praslin. My mother, though she was the simplest person in the world, really, had ideas that belonged to another generation, which even in those days I could scarcely understand; and at first she had not been at all willing to let herself be introduced to Mme. de Praslin, who had been plain Mlle. Sébastian!, while she, because she was a Duchess, felt that it was not for her to be introduced to my mother. And really, you know,” Mme. de Villeparisis went on, forgetting that she herself did not understand these fine shades of distinction, “even if she had just been Mme. de Choiseul, there was a good deal to be said for her claim. The Choiseuls are everything you could want; they spring from a sister of Louis the Fat; they were ruling princes down in Basigny. I admit that we beat them in marriages and in distinction, but the precedence is pretty much the same. This little difficulty gave rise to several amusing incidents, such as a luncheon party which was kept waiting a whole hour or more before one of these ladies could make up her mind to let herself be introduced to the other. In spite of which they became great friends, and she gave my mother a seat like that, in which people always refused to sit, just as you did, until one day my mother heard a carriage drive into the courtyard. She asked a young servant we had, who it was. ‘The Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, ma’am.’ ‘Very well, say that I am at home.’ A quarter of an hour passed; no one came. ‘What about the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld?’ my mother asked. ‘Where is she?’ ‘She’s on the stairs, ma’am, getting her breath,’ said the young servant, who had not been long up from the country, where my mother had the excellent habit of getting all her servants. Often she had seen them born. That’s the only way to get really good ones. And they’re the rarest of luxuries. And sure enough the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld had the greatest difficulty in getting upstairs, for she was an enormous woman, so enormous, indeed, that when she did come into the room my mother was quite at a loss for a moment to know where to put her. And then the seat that Mme. de Praslin had given her caught her eye. ‘Won’t you sit down?’ she said, bringing it forward. And the Duchess filled it from side to side. She was quite a pleasant woman, for all her massiveness. ‘She still creates an effect when she comes in,’ one of our friends said once. ‘She certainly creates an effect when she goes out,’ said my mother, who was rather more free in her speech than would be thought proper nowadays. Even in Mme. de La Rochefoucauld’s own drawing-room people weren’t afraid to make fun of her to her face (at which she was always the first to laugh) over her ample proportions. ‘But are you all alone?’ my grandmother once asked M. de La Rochefoucauld, when she had come to pay a call on the Duchess, and being met at the door by him had not seen his wife who was at the other end of the room. ‘Is Mme. de La Rochefoucauld not at home? I don’t see her.’—‘How charming of you!’ replied the Duke, who had about the worst judgment of any man I have ever known, but was not altogether lacking in humour.”

   After dinner, when I had retired upstairs with my grandmother, I said to her that the qualities which attracted us in Mme. de Villeparisis, her tact, her shrewdness, her discretion, her modesty in not referring to herself, were not, perhaps, of very great value since those who possessed them in the highest degree were simply people like Mole and Loménie, and that if the want of them can make our social relations unpleasant yet it did not prevent from becoming Chateaubriand, Vigny, Hugo, Balzac, a lot of foolish fellows who had no judgment, at whom it was easy to mock, like Bloch. . . . But at the name of Bloch, my grandmother cried out in protest. And she began to praise Mme. de Villeparisis. As we are told that it is the preservation of the species which guides our individual preferences in love, and, so that the child may be constituted in the most normal fashion, sends fat men in pursuit of lean women and vice versa, so in some dim way it was the requirements of my happiness threatened by my disordered nerves, by my morbid tendency to melancholy, to solitude, that made her allot the highest place to the qualities of balance and judgment, peculiar not only to Mme. de Villeparisis but to a society in which our ancestors saw blossom the minds of a Doudan, a M. de Rémusat, not to mention a Beausergent, a Joubert, a Sévigné, a type of mind that invests life with more happiness, with greater dignity than the converse refinements which brought a Baudelaire, a Poe, a Verlaine, a Rimbaud to sufferings, to a disrepute such as my grandmother did not wish for her daughter’s child. I interrupted her with a kiss and asked her if she had noticed some expression which Mme. de Villeparisis had used and which seemed to point to a woman who thought more of her noble birth than she was prepared to admit. In this way I used to submit my impressions of life to my grandmother, for I was never certain what degree of respect was due to anyone until she had informed me. Every evening I would come to her with the mental sketches that I had made during the day of all those non-existent people who were not her. Once I said to her: “I shouldn’t be able to live without you.” “But you mustn’t speak like that;” her voice was troubled. “We must harden our hearts more than that, you know. Or what would become of you if I went away on a journey? But I hope that you would be quite sensible and quite happy.”

    “I could manage to be sensible if you went away for a few days, but I should count the hours.”

    “But if I were to go away for months . . . ” (at the bare suggestion of such a thing my heart was wrung) “ . . . for years . . . for . . . ”

   We both remained silent. We dared not look one another in the face. And yet I was suffering more keenly from her anguish than from my own. And so I walked across to the window, and said to her, with a studied clearness of tone but with averted eyes:

    “You know what a creature of habit I am. For the first few days after I have been parted from the people I love best, I am wretched. But though I go on loving them just as much, I grow used to their absence; life becomes calm, bearable, pleasant; I could stand being parted from them for months, for years . . . ”

   I was obliged to stop, and looked straight out of the window. My grandmother went out of the room for something. But next day I began to talk to her about philosophy, and, speaking in a tone of complete indifference, but at the same time taking care that my grandmother should pay attention to what I was saying, I remarked what a curious thing it was that, according to the latest scientific discoveries, the materialist position appeared to be crumbling, and the most likely thing to be, once again, the survival of the soul and reunion in a life everlasting

   Mme. de Villeparisis gave us warning that presently she would not be able to see so much of us. A young nephew who was preparing for Sau-mur, and was meanwhile stationed in the neighbourhood, at Doncières, was coming to spend a few weeks’ furlough with her, and she would be devoting most of her time to him. In the course of our drives together she had boasted to us of his extreme cleverness, and above all of his goodness of heart; already I was imagining that he would have an instinctive feeling for me, that I was to be his best friend; and when, before his arrival, his aunt gave my grandmother to understand that he had unfortunately fallen into the clutches of an appalling woman with whom he was quite infatuated and who would never let him go, since I believed that that sort of love was doomed to end in mental aberration, crime and suicide, thinking how short the time was that was set apart for our friendship, already so great in my heart, although I had not yet set eyes on him, I wept for that friendship and for the misfortunes that were in store for it, as we weep for a person whom we love when some one has just told us that he is seriously ill and that his days are numbered

   One afternoon of scorching heat I was in the dining-room of the hotel, which they had plunged in semi-darkness, to shield it from the glare, by drawing the curtains which the sun gilded, while through the gaps between them I caught flashing blue glimpses of the sea, when along the central gangway leading inland from the beach to the high road I saw, tall, slender, his head held proudly erect upon a springing neck, a young man go past with searching eyes, whose skin was as fair and whose hair as golden as if they had absorbed all the rays of the%un. Dressed in a clinging, almost white material such as I could never have believed that any man would have the audacity to wear, the thinness of which suggested no less vividly than the coolness of the dining-room the heat and brightness of the glorious day outside, he was walking fast. His eyes, from one of which a monocle kept dropping, were of the colour of the sea. Everyone looked at him with interest as he passed, knowing that this young Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray was famed for the smartness of his clothes. All the newspapers had described the suit in which he had recently acted as second to the young Duc d’Uzès in a duel. One felt that this so special quality of his hair, his eyes, his skin, his figure, which would have marked him out in a crowd like a precious vein of opal, azure-shot and luminous, embedded in a mass of coarser substance, must correspond to a life different from that led by other men. So that when, before the attachment which Mme. de Villeparisis had been deploring, the prettiest women in society had disputed the possession of him, his presence, at a watering-place for instance, in the company of the beauty of the season to whom he was paying court, not only made her conspicuous, but attracted every eye fully as much to himself. Because of his ‘tone,’ of his impertinence befitting a young ‘lion,’ and especially of his astonishing good looks, some people even thought him effeminate, though without attaching any stigma, for everyone knew how manly he was and that he was a passionate ‘womaniser.’ This was Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew of whom she had spoken to us. I was overcome with joy at the thought that I was going to know him and to see him for several weeks on end, and confident that he would bestow on me all his affection. He strode rapidly across the hotel, seeming to be in pursuit of his monocle, which kept darting away in front of him like a butterfly. He was coming from the beach, and the sea which filled the lower half of the glass front of the hall gave him a background against which he was drawn at full length, as in certain portraits whose painters attempt, without in anyway falsifying the most accurate observation of contemporary life, but by choosing for their sitter appropriate surroundings, a polo ground, golf links, a racecourse, the bridge of a yacht, to furnish a modern equivalent of those canvases on which the old masters used to present the human figure in the foreground of a landscape. A carriage and pair was waiting for him at the door; and, while his monocle resumed its gambollings in the air of the sunlit street, with the elegance and mastery which a great pianist contrives to display in the simplest piece of execution, where it has not appeared possible that he could shew himself superior to a performer of the second class, Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew, taking the reins that were handed him by the groom, jumped on to the box seat by his side and, while he opened a letter which the manager of the hotel sent out after him, made his horses start

   What a disappointment was mine on the days that followed, when, each time that I met him outside or in the hotel — his head erect, perpetually balancing the movements of his limbs round the fugitive and dancing monocle which seemed to be their centre of gravity — I was forced to admit that he had evidently no desire to make our acquaintance, and saw that he did not bow to us although he must have known that we were friends of his aunt. And calling to mind the friendliness that Mme. de Villeparisis, and before her M. de Norpois, had shewn me, I thought that perhaps they were only of a bogus nobility, and that there might be a secret section in the laws that govern the aristocracy which allowed women, perhaps, and certain diplomats to discard, in their relations with plebeians, for a reason which was beyond me, the stiffness which must, on the other hand, be pitilessly maintained by a young Marquis. My intelligence might have told me the opposite. But the characteristic feature of the silly phase through which I was passing — a phase by no means irresponsive, indeed highly fertile — is that we do not consult our intelligence and that the most trivial attributes of other people seem to us then to form an inseparable part of their personality. In a world thronged with monsters and with gods, we are barely conscious of tranquillity. There is hardly one of the actions which we performed in that phase which we would not give anything, in later life, to be able to erase from our memory. Whereas what we ought to regret is that we no longer possess the spontaneity which made us perform them. In later life we look at things in a more practical way, in full conformity with the rest of society, but youth was the only time in which we learned anything

   This insolence which I surmised in M. de Saint-Loup, and all that it implied of ingrained severity, received confirmation from his attitude whenever he passed us, his body as inflexibly erect, his head always held as high, his gaze as impassive, or rather, I should say, as implacable, devoid of that vague respect which one has for the rights of other people, even if they do not know one’s aunt, one example of which was that I did not look in quite the same way at an old lady as at a gas lamp. These frigid manners were as far removed from the charming letters which, but a few days since, I had still been imagining him as writing to tell me of his regard for myself, as is removed from the enthusiasm of the Chamber and of the populace which he has been picturing himself as rousing by an imperishable speech, the humble, dull, obscure position of the dreamer who, after pondering it thus by himself, for himself, aloud, finds himself, once the imaginary applause has died away, just the same Tom, Dick or Harry as before. When Mme. de Villeparisis, doubtless in an attempt to counteract the bad impression that had been made on us by an exterior indicative of an arrogant and evil nature, spoke to us again of the inexhaustible goodness of her great-nephew (he was the son of one of her nieces, and a little older than myself), I marvelled how the world, with an utter disregard of truth, ascribes tenderness of heart to people whose hearts are in reality so hard and dry, provided only that they behave with common courtesy to the brilliant members of their own sets. Mme. de Villeparisis herself confirmed, though indirectly, my diagnosis, which was already a conviction, of the essential points of her nephew’s character one day when I met them both coming along a path so narrow that there was nothing for it but to introduce me to him. He seemed not to hear that a person’s name was being repeated to him, not a muscle of his face moved; his eyes, in which there shone not the faintest gleam of human sympathy, shewed merely in the insensibility, in the inanity of their gaze an exaggeration failing which there would have been nothing to distinguish them from lifeless mirrors. Then fastening on me those hard eyes, as though he wished to make sure of me before returning my salute, by an abrupt release which seemed to be due rather to a reflex action of his muscles than to an exercise of will, keeping between himself and me the greatest possible interval, he stretched his arm out to its full extension and, at the end of it, offered me his hand. I supposed that it must mean, at the very least, a duel when, next day, he sent me his card. But he spoke to me only of literature, declared after a long talk that he would like immensely to spend several hours with me every day. He had not only, in this encounter, given proof of an ardent zest for the things of the spirit, he had shewn a regard for myself which was little in keeping with his greeting of me the day before. After I had seen him repeat the same process whenever anyone was introduced to him, I realised that it was simply a social usage peculiar to his branch of the family, to which his mother, who had seen to it that he should be perfectly brought up, had moulded his limbs; he went through those motions without thinking, any more than he thought about his beautiful clothes or hair; they were a thing devoid of the moral significance which I had at first ascribed to them, a thing purely acquired like that other habit that he had of at once demanding an introduction to the family of anyone whom he knew, which had become so instinctive in him that, seeing me again the day after our talk, he fell upon me and without asking how I did begged me to make him known to my grandmother, who was with me, with the same feverish haste as if the request had been due to some instinct of self-preservation, like the act of warding off a blow, or of shutting one’s eyes to avoid a stream of boiling water, without which precautions it would have been dangerous to stay where one was a moment longer

   The first rites of exorcism once performed, as a wicked fairy discards her outer form and endures all the most enchanting graces, I saw this disdainful creature become the most friendly, the most considerate young man that I had ever met. “Good,” I said to myself, “I’ve been mistaken about him once already; I was taken in by a mirage; but I have corrected the first only to fall into a second, for he must be a great gentleman who has grown sick of his nobility and is trying to hide it.” As a matter of fact it was not long before all the exquisite breeding, all the friendliness of Saint-Loup were indeed to let me see another creature but one very different from what I had suspected

   This young man who had the air of a scornful, sporting aristocrat had in fact no respect, no interest save for and in the things of the spirit, and especially those modern manifestations of literature and art which seemed so ridiculous to his aunt; he was imbued, moreover, with what she called ‘Socialistic spoutings,’ was filled with the most profound contempt for his caste and spent long hours in the study of Nietzsche and Proudhon. He was one of those intellectuals, quick to admire what is good, who shut themselves up in a book, and are interested only in pure thought. Indeed in Saint-Loup the expression of this highly abstract tendency, which removed him so far from my customary preoccupations, while it seemed to me touching, also annoyed me not a little. I may say that when I realised properly who had been his father, on days when I had been reading memoirs rich in anecdotes of that famous Comte de Marsantes, in whom were embodied the special graces of a generation already remote, the mind full of speculation — anxious to obtain fuller details of the life that M. de Marsantes had led, it used to infuriate me that Robert de Saint-Loup, instead of being content to be the son of his father, instead of being able to guide me through the old-fashioned romance of what had been that father’s existence, had trained himself to enjoy Nietzsche and Proudhon. His father would not have shared my regret. He had been himself a man of brains, who had transcended the narrow confines of his life as a man of the world. He had hardly had time to know his son, but had hoped that his son would prove a better man than himself. And I really believe that, unlike the rest of the family, he would have admired his son, would have rejoiced at his abandoning what had been his own small diversions for austere meditations, and without saying a word, in his modesty as a great gentleman endowed with brains, he would have read in secret his son’s favourite authors in order to appreciate how far Robert was superior to himself

   There was, however, this rather painful consideration: that if M. de Marsantes, with his extremely open mind, would have appreciated a son so different from himself, Robert de Saint-Loup, because he was one of those who believe that merit is attached only to certain forms of art and life, had an affectionate but slightly contemptuous memory of a father who had spent all his time hunting and racing, who yawned at Wagner and raved over Offenbach. Saint-Loup had not the intelligence to see that intellectual worth has nothing to do with adhesion to any one aesthetic formula, and had for the intellectuality of M. de Marsantes much the same sort of scorn as might have been felt for Boieldieu or Labiche by a son of Boieldieu or Labiche who had become adepts in the most symbolic literature and the most complex music. “I scarcely knew my father,” he used to say. “He seems to have been a charming person. His tragedy was the deplorable age in which he lived. To have been born in the Faubourg Saint-Germain and to have to live in the days of La Belle Hélène would be enough to wreck any existence. Perhaps if he’d been some little shopkeeper mad about the Ring he’d have turned out quite different. Indeed they tell me that he was fond of literature. But that can never be proved, because literature to him meant such utterly god-forsaken books.” And in my own case, if I found Saint-Loup a trifle earnest, he could not understand why I was not more earnest still. Never judging anything except by the weight of the intelligence that it contained, never perceiving the magic appeal to the imagination that I found in things which he condemned as frivolous, he was astonished that I— I, to whom he imagined himself to be so utterly inferior — could take any interest in them

   >From the first Saint-Loup made a conquest of my grandmother, not only by the incessant acts of kindness which he went out of his way to shew to us both, but by the naturalness which he put into them as into everything. For naturalness — doubtless because through the artifice of man it allows a feeling of nature to permeate — was the quality which my grandmother preferred to all others, whether in gardens, where she did not like there to be, as there had been in our Combray garden, too formal borders, or at table, where she detested those dressed-up dishes in which you could hardly detect the foodstuffs that had gone to make them, or in piano-playing, which she did not like to be too finicking, too laboured, having indeed had a special weakness for the discords, the wrong notes of Rubinstein. This naturalness she found and enjoyed even in the clothes that Saint-Loup wore, of a pliant elegance, with nothing swagger, nothing formal about them, no stiffness or starch. She appreciated this rich young man still more highly for the free and careless way that he had of living in luxury without ‘smelling of money,’ without giving himself airs; she even discovered the charm of this naturalness in the incapacity which Saint-Loup had kept, though as a rule it is outgrown with childhood, at the same time as certain physiological peculiarities of that period, for preventing his face from at once reflecting every emotion. Something, for instance, that he wanted to have but had not expected, were it no more than a compliment, reacted in him in a burst of pleasure so quick, so burning, so volatile, so expansive that it was impossible for him to contain and to conceal it; a grin of delight seized irresistible hold of his face; the too delicate skin of his cheeks allowed a vivid glow to shine through them, his eyes sparkled with confusion and joy; and my grandmother was infinitely touched by this charming show of innocence and frankness, which, incidentally, in Saint-Loup — at any rate at the period of our first friendship — was not misleading. But I have known another person, and there are many such, in whom the physiological sincerity of that fleeting blush in no way excluded moral duplicity; as often as not it proves nothing more than the vivacity with which pleasure is felt — so that it disarms them and they are forced publicly to confess it — by natures capable of the vilest treachery. But where my grandmother did really adore Saint-Loup’s naturalness was in his way of admitting, without any evasion, his affection for me, to give expression to which he found words than which she herself, she told me, could not have thought of any more appropriate, more truly loving, words to which ‘Sévigné and Beausergent’ might have set their signatures. He was not afraid to make fun of my weaknesses — which he had discerned with an acuteness that made her smile — but as she herself would have done, lovingly, at the same time extolling my good qualities with a warmth, an impulsive freedom that shewed no sign of the reserve, the coldness by means of which young men of his age are apt to suppose that they give themselves importance. And he shewed in forestalling every discomfort, however slight, in covering my legs if the day had turned cold without my noticing it, in arranging (without telling me) to stay later with me in the evening if he thought that I was depressed or felt unwell, a vigilance which, from the point of view of my health, for which a more hardening discipline would perhaps have been better, my grandmother found almost excessive, though as a proof of his affection for myself she was deeply touched by it

   It was promptly settled between us that he and I were to be great friends for ever, and he would say ‘our friendship’ as though he were speaking of some important and delightful thing which had an existence independent of ourselves, and which he soon called — not counting his love for his mistress — the great joy of his life. These words made me rather uncomfortable and I was at a loss for an answer, for I did not feel when I was with him and talked to him — and no doubt it would have been the same with everyone else — any of that happiness which it was, on the other hand, possible for me to experience when I was by myself. For alone, at times, I felt surging from the depths of my being one or other of those impressions which gave me a delicious sense of comfort. But as soon as I was with some one else, when I began to talk to a friend, my mind at once ‘turned about,’ it was towards the listener and not myself that it directed its thoughts, and when they followed this outward course they brought me no pleasure. Once I had left Saint-Loup, I managed, with the help of words, to put more or less in order the confused minutes that I had spent with him; I told myself that I had a good friend, that a good friend was a rare thing, and I tasted, when I felt myself surrounded by ‘goods’ that were difficult to acquire, what was precisely the opposite of the pleasure that was natural to me, the opposite of the pleasure of having extracted from myself and brought to light something that was hidden in my inner darkness. If I had spent two or three hours in conversation with Saint-Loup, and he had expressed his admiration of what I had said to him, I felt a sort of remorse, or regret, or weariness at not having been left alone and ready, at last, to begin my work. But I told myself that one is not given intelligence for one’s own benefit only, that the greatest of men have longed for appreciation, that I could not regard as wasted hours in which I had built up an exalted idea of myself in the mind of my friend; I had no difficulty in persuading myself that I ought to be happy in consequence, and I hoped all the more anxiously that this happiness might never be taken from me simply because I had not yet been conscious of it. We fear more than the loss of everything else the disappearance of the ‘goods’ that have remained beyond our reach, because our heart has not taken possession of them. I felt that I was capable of exemplifying the virtues of friendship better than most people (because I should always place the good of my friends before those personal interests to which other people were devoted but which did not count for me), but not of finding happiness in a feeling which, instead of multiplying the differences that there were between my nature and those of other people — as there are among all of us — would cancel them. At the same time my mind was distinguishing in Saint-Loup a personality more collective than his own, that of the ‘noble’; which like an indwelling spirit moved his limbs, ordered his gestures and his actions; then, at such moments, although in his company, I was as much alone as I should have been gazing at a landscape the harmony of which I could understand. He was no more then than an object the properties of which, in my musing contemplations, I sought to explore. The perpetual discovery in him of this pre-existent, this aeonial creature, this aristocrat who was just what Robert aspired not to be, gave me a keen delight, but one that was intellectual and not social. In the moral and physical agility which gave so much grace to his kindnesses, in the ease with which he offered my grandmother his carriage and made her get into it, in the alacrity with which he sprang from the box, when he was afraid that I might be cold, to spread his own cloak over my shoulders, I felt not only the inherited litheness of the mighty hunters who had been for generations the ancestors of this young man who made no pretence save to intellectuality, their scorn of wealth which, subsisting in him side by side with his enjoyment of it simply because it enabled him to entertain his friends more lavishly, made him so carelessly shower his riches at their feet; I felt in him especially the certainty or the illusion in the minds of those great lords of being ‘better than other people,’ thanks to which they had not been able to hand down to Saint-Loup that anxiety to shew that one is ‘just as good that dread of seeming inferior, of which he was indeed wholly unconscious, but which mars with so much ugliness, so much awkwardness, the most sincere overtures of a plebeian. Sometimes I found fault with myself for thus taking pleasure in my friend as in a work of art, that is to say in regarding the play of all the parts of his being as harmoniously ordered by a general idea from which they depended but which he did not know, so that it added nothing to his own good qualities, to that personal value, intellectual and moral, to which he attached so high a price

   And yet that idea was to a certain extent their determining cause. It was because he was a gentleman that that mental activity, those socialist aspirations, which made him seek the company of young students, arrogant and ill-dressed, connoted in him something really pure and disinterested which was not to be found in them. Looking upon himself as the heir of an ignorant and selfish caste, he was sincerely anxious that they should forgive in him that aristocratic origin which they, on the contrary, found irresistibly attractive and on account of which they sought to know him, though with a show of coldness and indeed of insolence towards him. He was thus led to make advances to people from whom my parents, faithful to the sociological theories of Combray, would have been stupefied at his not turning away in disgust. One day when we were sitting on the sands, Saint-Loup and I, we heard issuing from a canvas tent against which we were leaning a torrent of imprecation against the swarm of Israelites that infested Balbec. “You can’t go a yard without meeting them,” said the voice. “I am not in principle irremediably hostile to the Jewish nation, but here there is a plethora of them. You hear nothing but, ‘I thay, Apraham, I’ve chust theen Chacop.’ You would think you were in the Rue d’Abou-kir.” The man who thus inveighed against Israel emerged at last from the tent; we raised our eyes to behold this anti-Semite. It was my old friend Bloch. Saint-Loup at once begged me to remind him that they had met before the Board of Examiners, when Bloch had carried off the prize of honour, and since then at a popular university course

   At the most I may have smiled now and then, to discover in Robert the marks of his Jesuit schooling, in the awkwardness which the fear of hurting people’s feelings at once created in him whenever one of his intellectual friends made a social error, did something silly to which Saint-Loup himself attached no importance but felt that the other would have blushed if anybody had noticed it. And it was Robert who used to blush as though it had been he that was to blame, for instance on the day when Bloch, after promising to come and see him at the hotel, went on:

    “As I cannot endure to be kept waiting among all the false splendour of these great caravanserais, and the Hungarian band would make me ill, you must tell the ‘lighft-boy’ to make them shut up, and to let you know at once.”

   Personally, I was not particularly anxious that Bloch should come to the hotel. He was at Balbec not by himself, unfortunately, but with his sisters, and they in turn had innumerable relatives and friends staying there. Now this Jewish colony was more picturesque than pleasant. Balbec was in this respect like such countries as Russia or Rumania, where the geography books teach us that the Israelite population does not enjoy anything approaching the same esteem and has not reached the same stage of assimilation as, for instance, in Paris. Always together, with no blend of any other element, when the cousins and uncles of Bloch or their coreligionists male or female repaired to the Casino, the ladies to dance, the gentlemen branching off towards the baccarat-tables, they formed a solid troop, homogeneous within itself, and utterly dissimilar to the people who watched them go past and found them there again every year without ever exchanging a word or a sign with them, whether these were on the Cambremers’ list, or the presiding magistrate’s little group, professional or ‘business’ people, or even simple corn-chandlers from Paris, whose daughters, handsome, proud, derisive and French as the statues at Rheims, would not care to mix with that horde of ill-bred tomboys, who carried their zeal for ‘seaside fashions’ so far as to be always apparently on their way home from shrimping or out to dance the tango. As for the men, despite the brilliance of their dinner-jackets and patent-leather shoes, the exaggeration of their type made one think of what people call the ‘intelligent research’ of painters who, having to illustrate the Gospels or the Arabian Nights, consider the country in which the scenes are laid, and give to Saint Peter or to Ali-Baba the identical features of the heaviest ‘punter’ at the Balbec tables. Bloch introduced his sisters, who, though he silenced their chatter with the utmost rudeness, screamed with laughter at the mildest sallies of this brother, their blindly worshipped idol. So that it is probable that this set of people contained, like every other, perhaps more than any other, plenty of attractions, merits and virtues. But in order to experience these, one had first to penetrate its enclosure. Now it was not popular; it could feel this; it saw in its unpopularity the mark of an anti-semitism to which it presented a bold front in a compact and closed phalanx into which, as it happened, no one ever dreamed of trying to make his way

   At his use of the word ‘lighft’ I had all the less reason to be surprised in that, a few days before, Bloch having asked me why I had come to Balbec (although it seemed to him perfectly natural that he himself should be there) and whether it had been “in the hope of making grand friends,” when I had explained to him that this visit was a fulfilment of one of my earliest longings, though one not so deep as my longing to see Venice, he had replied: “Yes, of course, to sip iced drinks with the pretty ladies, while you pretend to be reading the Stones of Venighce, by Lord John Ruskin, a dreary shaver, in fact one of the most garrulous old barbers that you could find.” So that Bloch evidently thought that in England not only were all the inhabitants of the male sex called ‘Lord,’ but the letter ‘i’ was invariably pronounced ‘igh.’ As for Saint-Loup, this mistake in pronunciation seemed to him all the less serious inasmuch as he saw in it pre-eminently a want of those almost ‘society’ notions which my new friend despised as fully as he was versed in them. But the fear lest Bloch, discovering one day that one says ‘Venice’ and that Ruskin was not a lord, should retrospectively imagine that Robert had been laughing at him, made the latter feel as guilty as if he had been found wanting in the indulgence with which, as we have seen, he overflowed, so that the blush which would no doubt one day dye the cheek of Bloch on the discovery of his error, Robert already, by anticipation and reflex action, could feel mounting to his own. For he fully believed that Bloch attached more importance than he to this mistake. Which Bloch proved to be true some time later, when he heard me pronounce the word ‘lift,’ by breaking in with:

    “Oh, you say ‘lift,’ do you?” And then, in a dry and lofty tone: “Not that it is of the slightest importance.” A phrase that is like a reflex action of the body, the same in all men whose self-esteem is great, in the gravest circumstances as well as in the most trivial, betraying there as clearly as on this occasion how important the thing in question seems to him who declares that it is of no importance; a tragic phrase at times, the first to escape (and then how heart-breaking) the lips of every man at all proud from whom we have just taken the last hope to which he still clung by refusing to do him a service. “Oh, well, it’s not of the slightest importance; I shall make some other arrangement:” the other arrangement which it is not of the slightest importance that he should be driven to adopt being often suicide

   Apart from this, Bloch made me the prettiest speeches. He was certainly anxious to be on the best of terms with me. And yet he asked me: “Is it because you’ve taken a fancy to raise yourself to the peerage that you run after de Saint-Loup-en-Bray? You must be going through a fine crisis of snobbery. Tell me, are you a snob? I think so, what?” Not that his desire to be friendly had suddenly changed. But what is called, in not too correct language, ‘ill breeding’ was his defect, and therefore the defect which he was bound to overlook, all the more that by which he did not believe that other people could be shocked. In the human race the frequency of the virtues that are identical in us all is not more wonderful than the multiplicity of the defects that are peculiar to each one of us. Undoubtedly, it is not common sense that is “the commonest thing in the world”; but human kindness. In the most distant, the most desolate ends of the earth, we marvel to see it blossom of its own accord, as in a remote valley a poppy like the poppies in the world beyond, poppies which it has never seen as it has never known aught but the wind that, now and again, stirring the folds of its scarlet cloak, disturbs its solitude. Even if this human kindness, paralysed by self-interest, is not exercised, it exists none the less, and whenever any inconstant egoist does not restrain its action, when, for example, he is reading a novel or a newspaper, it will bud, blossom, grow, even in the heart of him who, cold-blooded in real life, has retained a tender heart, as a lover of fiction, for the weak, the righteous and the persecuted. But the variety of our defects is no less remarkable than the similarity of our virtues. Each of us has his own, so much so that to continue loving him we are obliged not to take them into account but to ignore them and look only to the rest of his character. The most perfect person in the world has a certain defect which shocks us or makes us angry. One man is of rare intelligence, sees everything from an exalted angle, never speaks evil of anyone, but will pocket and forget letters of supreme importance which it was he himself who asked you to let him post for you, and will then miss a vital engagement without offering you any excuse, with a smile, because he prides himself upon never knowing the time. Another is so refined, so gentle, so delicate in his conduct that he never says anything about you before your face except what you are glad to hear; but you feel that he refrains from uttering, that he keeps buried in his heart, where they grow bitter, very different opinions, and the pleasure that he derives from seeing you is so dear to him that he will let you faint with exhaustion sooner than leave you to yourself. A third has more sincerity, but carries it so far that he feels bound to let you know, when you have pleaded the state of your health as an excuse for not having been to see him, that you were seen going to the theatre and were reported to be looking well, or else that he has not been able to profit entirely by the action which you have taken on his behalf, which, by the way, three other of his friends had already offered to take, so that he is only moderately indebted to you. In similar circumstances the previous friend would have pretended not to know that you had gone to the theatre, or that other people could have done him the same service. But this last friend feels himself obliged to repeat or to reveal to somebody the very thing that is most likely to give offence; is delighted with his own frankness and tells you, emphatically: “I am like that.” While others infuriate you by their exaggerated curiosity, or by a want of curiosity so absolute that you can speak to them of the most sensational happenings without their grasping what it is all about; and others again take months to answer you if your letter has been about something that concerns yourself and not them, or else, if they write that they are coming to ask you for something and you dare not leave the house for fear of missing them, do not appear, but leave you in suspense for weeks because, not having received from you the answer which their letter did not in the least ‘expect,’ they have concluded that you must be cross with them. And others, considering their own wishes and not yours, talk to you without letting you get a word in if they are in good spirits and want to see you, however urgent the work you may have in hand, but if they feel exhausted by the weather or out of humour, you cannot get a word out of them, they meet your efforts with an inert languor and no more take the trouble to reply, even in monosyllables, to what you say to them than if they had not heard you. Each of our friends has his defects so markedly that to continue to love him we are obliged to seek consolation for those defects — in the thought of his talent, his goodness, his affection for ourself — or rather to leave them out of account, and for that we need to display all our good will. Unfortunately our obliging obstinacy in refusing to see the defect in our friend is surpassed by the obstinacy with which he persists in that defect, from his own blindness to it or the blindness that he attributes to other people. For he does not notice it himself, or imagines that it is not noticed. Since the risk of giving offence arises principally from the difficulty of appreciating what does and what does not pass unperceived, we ought, at least, from prudence, never to speak of ourselves, because that is a subject on which we may be sure that other people’s views are never in accordance with our own. If we find as many surprises as on visiting a house of plain exterior which inside is full of hidden treasures, torture-chambers, skeletons, when we discover the true lives of other people, the real beneath the apparent universe, we are no less surprised if, in place of the image that we have made of ourself with the help of all the things that people have said to us, we learn from the terms in which they speak of us in our absence what an entirely different image they have been carrying in their own minds of us and of our life. So that whenever we have spoken about ourselves, we may be sure that our inoffensive and prudent words, listened to with apparent politeness and hypocritical approbation, have given rise afterwards to the most exasperated or the most mirthful, but in either case the least favourable, criticism. The least risk that we run is that of irritating people by the disproportion that there is between our idea of ourselves and the words that we use, a disproportion which as a rule makes people’s talk about themselves as ludicrous as the performances of those self-styled music-lovers who when they feel the need to hum a favourite melody compensate for the inadequacy of their inarticulate murmurings by a strenuous mimicry and a look of admiration which is hardly justified by all that they let us hear. And to the bad habit of speaking about oneself and one’s defects there must be added, as part of the same thing, that habit of denouncing in other people defects precisely analogous to one’s own. For it is always of those defects that people speak, as though it were a way of speaking about oneself, indirectly, which added to the pleasure of absolution that of confession. Besides it seems that our attention, always attracted by what is characteristic of ourselves, notices that more than anything else in other people. One short-sighted man says of another: “But he can scarcely open his eyes!”; a consumptive has his doubts as to the pulmonary integrity of the most robust; an unwashed man speaks only of the baths that other people do not take; an evil-smelling man insists that other people smell; a cuckold sees cuckolds everywhere, a light woman light women, a snob snobs. Then, too, every vice, like every profession, requires and trains a special knowledge which we are never loath to display. The invert detects and denounces inverts; the tailor asked out to dine, before he has begun to talk to you, has passed judgment on the cloth of your coat, which his fingers are itching to feel, and if after a few words of conversation you were to ask a dentist what he really thought of you, he would tell you how many of your teeth wanted filling. To him nothing appears more important, nor more absurd to you who have noticed his own. And it is not only when we speak of ourselves that we imagine other people to be blind; we behave as though they were. On every one of us there is a special god in attendance who hides from him or promises him the concealment from other people of his defect, just as he stops the eyes and nostrils of people who do not wash to the streaks of dirt which they carry in their ears and the smell of sweat which emanates from their armpits, and assures them that they can with impunity carry both of these about a world that will notice nothing. And those who wear artificial pearls, or give them as presents, imagine that people will take them to be genuine. Bloch was ill-bred, neurotic, a snob, and, since he belonged to a family of little repute, had to support, as on the floor of ocean, the incalculable pressure that was imposed on him not only by the Christians upon the surface but by all the intervening layers of Jewish castes superior to his own, each of them crushing with its contempt the one that was immediately beneath it. To carve his way through to the open air by raising himself from Jewish family to Jewish family would have taken Bloch many thousands of years. It was better worth his while to seek an outlet in another direction

   When Bloch spoke to me of the crisis of snobbery through which I must be passing, and bade me confess that I was a snob, I might well have replied: “If I were, I should not be going about with you.” I said merely that he was not being very polite. Then he tried to apologise, but in the way that is typical of the ill-bred man who is only too glad to hark back to whatever it was if he can find an opportunity to aggravate his offence. “Forgive me,” he used now to plead, whenever we met, “I have vexed you, tormented you; I have been wantonly mischievous. And yet — man in general and your friend in particular is so singular an animal — you cannot imagine the affection that I, I who tease you so cruelly, have for you. It carries me often, when I think of you, to tears.” And he gave an audible sob

   What astonished me more in Bloch than his bad manners was to find how the quality of his conversation varied. This youth, so hard to please that of authors who were at the height of their fame he would say: “He’s a gloomy idiot; he’s a sheer imbecile,” would every now and then tell, with immense gusto, stories that were simply not funny or would instance as a ‘really remarkable person’ some man who was completely insignificant. This double scale of measuring the wit, the worth, the interest of people continued to puzzle me until I was introduced to M. Bloch, senior

   I had not supposed that we should ever be allowed to know him, for Bloch junior had spoken ill of me to Saint-Loup and of Saint-Loup to me. In particular, he had said to Robert that I was (always) a frightful snob. “Yes, really, he is overjoyed at knowing M. LLLLegrandin.” This trick of isolating a word, was, in Bloch, a sign at once of irony and of learning. Saint-Loup, who had never heard the name of Legrandin, was bewildered. “But who is he?” “Oh, he’s a bit of all right, he is!” Bloch laughed, thrusting his hands into his pockets as though for warmth, convinced that he was at that moment engaged in contemplation of the picturesque aspect of an extraordinary country gentleman compared to whom those of Barbey d’Aurevilly were as nothing. He consoled himself for his inability to portray M. Legrandin by giving him a string of capital L’s, smacking his lips over the name as over a wine from the farthest bin. But these subjective enjoyments remained hidden from other people. If he spoke ill of me to Saint-Loup he made up for it by speaking no less ill of Saint-Loup to me. We had each of us learned these slanders in detail, the next day, not that we repeated them to each other, a thing which would have seemed to us very wrong, but to Bloch appeared so natural and almost inevitable that in his natural anxiety, in the certainty moreover that he would be telling us only what each of us was bound sooner or later to know, he preferred to anticipate the disclosure and, taking Saint-Loup aside, admitted that he had spoken ill of him, on purpose, so that it might be repeated to him, swore to him “by Zeus Kronion, binder of oaths” that he loved him dearly, that he would lay down his life for him; and wiped away a tear. The same day, he contrived to see me alone, made his confession, declared that he had acted in my interest, because he felt that a certain kind of social intercourse was fatal to me and that I was ‘worthy of better things.’ Then, clasping me by the hand, with the sentimentality of a drunkard, albeit his drunkenness was purely nervous: “Believe me,” he said, “and may the black Ker seize me this instant and bear me across the portals of Hades, hateful to men, if yesterday, when I thought of you, of Combray, of my boundless affection for you, of afternoon hours in class which you do not even remember, I did not lie awake weeping all night long. Yes, all night long, I swear it, and alas, I know — for I know the human soul — you will not believe me.” I did indeed ‘not believe’ him, and to his words which, I felt, he was making up on the spur of the moment, and expanding as he went on, his swearing ‘by Ker’ added no great weight, the Hellenic cult being in Bloch purely literary. Besides, whenever he began to grow sentimental and wished his hearer to grow sentimental over a falsehood, he would say: “I swear it,” more for the hysterical satisfaction of lying than to make people think that he was speaking the truth. I did not believe what he was saying, but I bore him no ill-will for that, for I had inherited from my mother and grandmother their incapacity for resentment even of far worse offenders, and their habit of never condemning anyone

   Besides, he was not altogether a bad youth, this Bloch; he could be, and was at times quite charming. And now that the race of Combray, the race from which sprang creatures absolutely unspoiled like my grandmother and mother, seems almost extinct, as I have hardly any choice now save between honest brutes — insensible and loyal, in whom the mere sound of their voices shews at once that they take absolutely no interest in one’s life — and another kind of men who so long as they are with one understand one, cherish one, grow sentimental even to tears, take — their revenge a few hours later by making some cruel joke at one’s expense, but return to one, always just as comprehending, as charming, as closely assimilated, for the moment, to oneself, I think that it is of this latter sort that I prefer if not the moral worth at any rate the society

    “You cannot imagine my grief when I think of you,” Bloch went on. “When you come to think of it, it is a rather Jewish side of my nature,” he added ironically, contracting his pupils as though he had to prepare for the microscope an infinitesimal quantity of ‘Jewish blood,’ and as might (but never would) have said a great French noble who among his ancestors, all Christian, might nevertheless have included Samuel Bernard, or further still, the Blessed Virgin from whom, it is said, the Levy family claim descent, “coming out. I rather like,” he continued, “to find room among my feelings for the share (not that it is more than a very tiny share) which may be ascribed to my Jewish origin.” He made this statement because it seemed to him at once clever and courageous to speak the truth about his race, a truth which at the same time he managed to water down to a remarkable extent, like misers who decide to pay their debts but have not the courage to pay more than half. This kind of deceit which consists in having the boldness to proclaim the truth, but only after mixing with it an ample measure of lies which falsify it, is commoner than people think, and even among those who do not habitually practise it certain crises in life, especially those in which love is at stake, give them an opportunity of taking to it

   All these confidential diatribes by Bloch to Saint-Loup against me and to me against Saint-Loup ended in an invitation to dinner. I am by no means sure that he did not first make an attempt to secure Saint-Loup by himself. It would have been so like Bloch to do so that probably he did; but if so success did not crown his effort, for it was to myself and Saint-Loup that Bloch said one day: “Dear master, and you, O horseman beloved of Ares, de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, tamer of horses, since I have encountered you by the shore of Amphitrite, resounding with foam, hard by the tents of the swift-shipped Méniers, will both of you come to dinner any day this week with my illustrious sire, of blameless heart?” He proffered this invitation because he desired to attach himself more closely to Saint-Loup who would, he hoped, secure him the right of entry into aristocratic circles. Formed by me for myself, this ambition would have seemed to Bloch the mark of the most hideous snobbishness, quite in keeping with the opinion that he already held of a whole side of my nature which he did not regard — or at least had not hitherto regarded — as its most important side; but the same ambition in himself seemed to him the proof of a finely developed curiosity in a mind anxious to carry out certain social explorations from which he might perhaps glean some literary benefit. M. Bloch senior, when his son had told him that he was going to bring one of his friends in to dinner, and had in a sarcastic but satisfied tone enunciated the name and title of that friend: “The Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,” had been thrown into great commotion. “The Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray! I’ll be jiggered!” he had exclaimed, using the oath which was with him the strongest indication of social deference. And he cast at a son capable of having formed such an acquaintance an admiring glance which seemed to say: “Really, it is astounding. Can this prodigy be indeed a child of mine?” which gave my friend as much pleasure as if his monthly allowance had been increased by fifty francs. For Bloch was not in his element at home and felt that his father treated him like a lost sheep because of his lifelong admiration for Leconte de Lisle, Heredia and other ‘Bohemians.’ But to have got to know Saint-Loup-en-Bray, whose father had been chairman of the Suez Canal board (‘I’ll be jiggered!’) was an indisputable ‘score.’ What a pity, indeed, that they had left in Paris, for fear of its being broken on the journey, the stereoscope. Alone among men, M. Bloch senior had the art, or at least the right to exhibit it. He did this, moreover, on rare occasions only, and then to good purpose, on evenings when there was a full-dress affair, with hired waiters. So that from these exhibitions of the stereoscope there emanated, for those who were present, as it were a special distinction, a privileged position, and for the master of the house who gave them a reputation such as talent confers on a man — which could not have been greater had the photographs been taken by M. Bloch himself and the machine his own invention. “You weren’t invited to Solomon’s yesterday?” one of the family would ask another. “No! I was not one of the elect. What was on?” “Oh, a great how-d’ye-do, the stereoscope, the whole box of tricks!” “Indeed! If they had the stereoscope I’m sorry I wasn’t there; they say Solomon is quite amazing when he works it.”—“It can’t be helped;” said M. Bloch now to his son, “it’s a mistake to let him have everything at once; that would leave him nothing to look forward to.” He had actually thought, in his paternal affection and in the hope of touching his son’s heart, of sending for the instrument. But there was not time, or rather they had thought there would not be; for we were obliged to put off the dinner because Saint-Loup could not leave the hotel, where he was waiting for an uncle who was coming to spend a few days with Mme. de Villeparisis. Since — for he was greatly addicted to physical culture, and especially to long walks — it was largely on foot, spending the night in wayside farms, that this uncle was to make the journey from the country house in which he was staying, the precise date of his arrival at Balbec was by no means certain. And Saint-Loup, afraid to stir out of doors, even entrusted me with the duty of taking to Incauville, where the nearest telegraph-office was, the messages that he sent every day to his mistress. The uncle for whom we were waiting was called Palamède, a name that had come down to him from his ancestors, the Princes of Sicily. And later on when I found, as I read history, belonging to this or that Podestà or Prince of the Church, the same Christian name, a fine renaissance medal — some said, a genuine antique — that had always remained in the family, having passed from generation to generation, from the Vatican cabinet to the uncle of my friend, I felt the pleasure that is reserved for those who, unable from lack of means to start a case of medals, or a picture gallery, look out for old names (names of localities, instructive and picturesque as an old map, a bird’s-eye view, a sign-board or a return of customs; baptismal names, in which rings out and is plainly heard, in their fine French endings, the defect of speech, the intonation of a racial vulgarity, the vicious pronunciation by which our ancestors made Latin and Saxon words undergo lasting mutilations which in due course became the august law-givers of our grammar books) and, in short, by drawing upon their collections of ancient and sonorous words, give themselves concerts like the people who acquire viols da gamba and viols d’amour so as to perform the music of days gone by upon old-fashioned instruments. Saint-Loup told me that even in the most exclusive aristocratic society his uncle Palamède had the further distinction of being particularly difficult to approach, contemptuous, double-dyed in his nobility, forming with his brother’s wife and a few other chosen spirits what was known as the Phoenix Club. There even his insolence was so much dreaded that it had happened more than once that people of good position who had been anxious to meet him and had applied to his own brother for an introduction had met with a refusal: “Really, you mustn’t ask me to introduce you to my brother Palamède. My wife and I, we would all of us do our best for you, but it would be no good. Besides, there’s always the danger of his being rude to you, and I shouldn’t like that.” At the Jockey Club he had, with a few of his friends, marked a list of two hundred members whom they would never allow to be introduced to them. And in the Comte de Paris’s circle he was known by the nickname of ‘The Prince’ because of his distinction and his pride

   Saint-Loup told me about his uncle’s early life, now a long time ago. Every day he used to take women to a bachelor establishment which he shared with two of his friends, as good-looking as himself, on account of which they were known as ‘The Three Graces.’

    “One day, a man who just now is very much in the eye, as Balzac would say, of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but who at a rather awkward period of his early life displayed odd tastes, asked my uncle to let him come to this place. But no sooner had he arrived than it was not to the ladies but to my uncle Palamède that he began to make overtures. My uncle pretended not to understand, made an excuse to send for his two friends; they appeared on the scene, seized the offender, stripped him, thrashed him till he bled, and then with twenty degrees of frost outside kicked him into the street where he was found more dead than alive; so much so that the police started an inquiry which the poor devil had the greatest difficulty in getting them to abandon. My uncle would never go in for such drastic methods now, in fact you can’t conceive the number of men of humble position that he, who is so haughty with people in society, has shewn his affection, taken under his wing, even if he is paid for it with ingratitude. It may be a servant who has looked after him in a hotel, for whom he will find a place in Paris, or a farm-labourer whom he will pay to have taught a trade. That is really the rather nice side of his character, in contrast to his social side.” Saint-Loup indeed belonged to that type of young men of fashion, situated at an altitude at which it has been possible to cultivate such expressions as: “What is really rather nice about him,” “His rather nice side,” precious seeds which produce very rapidly a way of looking at things in which one counts oneself as nothing and the ‘people’ as everything; the exact opposite, in a word, of plebeian pride. “It seems, it is quite impossible to imagine how he set the tone, how he laid down the law for the whole of society when he was a young man. He acted entirely for himself; in any circumstances he did what seemed pleasing to himself, what was most convenient, but at once the snobs would start copying him. If he felt thirsty at the play, and sent out from his box for a drink, the little sitting-rooms behind all the boxes would be filled, a week later, with refreshments. One wet summer, when he had a touch of rheumatism, he ordered an ulster of a loose but warm vicuna wool, which is used only for travelling rugs, and kept the blue and orange stripes shewing. The big tailors at once received orders from all their customers for blue and orange ulsters of rough wool. If he had some reason for wishing to keep every trace of ceremony out of a dinner in a country house where he was spending the day, and to point the distinction had come without evening clothes and sat down to table in the suit he had been wearing that afternoon, it became the fashion, when you were dining in the country, not to dress. If he was eating some special sweet and instead of taking his spoon used a knife, or a special implement of his own invention which he had had made for him by a silversmith, or his fingers, it at once became wrong to eat it in any other way. He wanted once to hear some Beethoven quartets again (for with all his preposterous ideas he is no fool, mind, he has great gifts) and arranged for some musicians to come and play them to him and a few friends once a week. The ultra-fashionable thing that season was to give quite small parties, with chamber music. I should say he’s not done at all badly out of life. With his looks, he must have had any number of women! I can’t tell you exactly whom, for he is very discreet. But I do know that he was thoroughly unfaithful to my poor aunt. Not that that prevented his being always perfectly charming to her, and her adoring him; he was in mourning for her for years. When he is in Paris, he still goes to the cemetery nearly every day.”

   The morning after Robert had told me all these things about his uncle, while he waited for him (and waited, as it happened, in vain), as I was coming by myself past the Casino on my way back to the hotel, I had the sensation of being watched by somebody who was not far off. I turned my head and saw a man of about forty, very tall and rather stout, with a very dark moustache, who, nervously slapping the leg of his trousers with a switch, kept fastened upon me a pair of eyes dilated with observation. Every now and then those eyes were shot through by a look of intense activity such as the sight of a person whom they do not know excites only in men to whom, for whatever reason, it suggests thoughts that would not occur to anyone else — madmen, for instance, or spies. He trained upon me a supreme stare at once bold, prudent, rapid and profound, like a last shot which one fires at an enemy at the moment when one turns to flee, and, after first looking all round him, suddenly adopting an absent and lofty air, by an abrupt revolution of his whole body turned to examine a playbill on the wall in the reading of which he became absorbed, while he hummed a tune and fingered the moss-rose in his buttonhole. He drew from his pocket a note-book in which he appeared to be taking down the title of the performance that was announced, looked two or three times at his watch, pulled down over his eyes a black straw hat the brim of which he extended with his hand held out over it like a visor, as though to see whether some one were at last coming, made the perfunctory gesture of annoyance by which people mean to shew that they have waited long enough, although they never make it when they are really waiting, then pushing back his hat and exposing a scalp cropped close except at the sides where he allowed a pair of waved ‘pigeon’s-wings’ to grow quite long, he emitted the loud panting breath that people give who are not feeling too hot but would like it to be thought that they were. He gave me the impression of a ‘hotel crook’ who had been watching my grandmother and myself for some days, and while he was planning to rob us had just discovered that I had surprised him in the act of spying; to put me off the scent, perhaps he was seeking only, by his new attitude, to express boredom and detachment, but it was with an exaggeration so aggressive that his object appeared to be — at least as much as the dissipating of the suspicions that I must have had of him — to avenge a humiliation which quite unconsciously I must have inflicted on him, to give me the idea not so much that he had not seen me as that I was an object of too little importance to attract his attention. He threw back his shoulders with an air of bravado, bit his lips, pushed up his moustache, and in the lens of his eyes made an adjustment of something that was indifferent, harsh, almost insulting. So effectively that the singularity of his expression made me take him at one moment for a thief and at another for a lunatic. And yet his scrupulously ordered attire was far more sober and far more simple than that of any of the summer visitors I saw at Balbec, and gave a reassurance to my own suit, so often humiliated by the dazzling and commonplace whiteness of their holiday garb. But my grandmother was coming towards me, we took a turn together, and I was waiting for her, an hour later, outside the hotel into which she had gone for a moment, when I saw emerge from it Mme. de Villeparisis with Robert de Saint-Loup and the stranger who had stared at me so intently outside the Casino. Swift as a lightning-flash his look shot through me, just as at the moment when I first noticed him, and returned, as though he had not seen me, to hover, slightly lowered, before his eyes, dulled, like the neutral look which feigns to see nothing without and is incapable of reporting anything to the mind within, the look which expresses merely the satisfaction of feeling round it the eyelids which it cleaves apart with its sanctimonious roundness, the devout, the steeped look that we see on the faces of certain hypocrites, the smug look on those of certain fools. I saw that he had changed his clothes. The suit he was wearing was darker even than the other; and no doubt this was because the true distinction in dress lies nearer to simplicity than the false; but there was something more; when one came near him one felt that if colour was almost entirely absent from these garments it was not because he who had banished it from them was indifferent to it but rather because for some reason he forbade himself the enjoyment of it. And the sobriety which they displayed seemed to be of the kind that comes from obedience to a rule of diet rather than from want of appetite. A dark green thread harmonised, in the stuff of his trousers, with the clock on his socks, with a refinement which betrayed the vivacity of a taste that was everywhere else conquered, to which this single concession had been made out of tolerance for such a weakness, while a spot of red on his necktie was imperceptible, like a liberty which one dares not take

    “How are you? Let me introduce my nephew, the Baron de Guermantes,” Mme. de Villeparisis greeted me, while the stranger without looking at me, muttering a vague “Charmed!” which he followed with a “H’m, h’m, h’m” to give his affability an air of having been forced, and doubling back his little finger, forefinger and thumb, held out to me his middle and ring fingers, the latter bare of any ring, which I clasped through his suede glove; then, without lifting his eyes to my face, he turned towards Mme. de Villeparisis

    “Good gracious; I shall be forgetting my own name next!” she exclaimed. “Here am I calling you Baron de Guermantes. Let me introduce the Baron de Charlus. After all, it’s not a very serious mistake,” she went on, “for you’re a thorough Guermantes whatever else you are.”

   By this time my grandmother had reappeared, and we all set out together. Saint-Loup’s uncle declined to honour me not only with a word, with so much as a look, even, in my direction. If he stared strangers out of countenance (and during this short excursion he two or three times hurled his terrible and searching scrutiny like a sounding lead at insignificant people of obviously humble extraction who happened to pass), to make up for that he never for a moment, if I was to judge by myself, looked at the people whom he did know, just as a detective on special duty might except his personal friends from his professional vigilance. Leaving them — my grandmother, Mme. de Villeparisis and him — to talk to one another, I fell behind with Saint-Loup

    “Tell me, am I right in thinking I heard Mme. de Villeparisis say just now to your uncle that he was a Guermantes?”

    “Of course he is; Palamède de Guermantes.”

    “Not the same Guermantes who have a place near Combray, and claim descent from Geneviève de Brabant?”

    “Most certainly: my uncle, who is the very last word in heraldry and all that sort of thing, would tell you that our ‘cry,’ our war-cry, that is to say, which was changed afterwards to ‘Passavant’ was originally ‘Combraysis,’” he said, smiling so as not to appear to be priding himself on this prerogative of a ‘cry,’ which only the semi-royal houses, the great chiefs of feudal bands enjoyed. “It’s his brother who has the place now.”

   And so she was indeed related, and quite closely, to the Guermantes, this Mme. de Villeparisis who had so long been for me the lady who had given me a duck filled with chocolates, when I was little, more remote then from the Guermantes way than if she had been shut up somewhere on the Méséglise, less brilliant, less highly placed by me than was the Combray optician, and who now suddenly went through one of those fantastic rises in value, parallel to the depreciations, no less unforeseen, of other objects in our possession, which — rise and fall alike — introduce in our youth and in those periods of our life in which a trace of youth persists changes as numerous as the Metamorphoses of Ovid

    “Haven’t they got, down there, the busts of all the old lords of Guermantes?”

    “Yes; and a lovely sight they are!” Saint-Loup was ironical. “Between you and me, I look on all that sort of thing as rather a joke. But they have got at Guermantes, what is a little more interesting, and, that is quite a touching portrait of my aunt by Carrière. It’s as fine as Whistler or Velasquez,” went on Saint-Loup, who in his neophyte zeal was not always very exact about degrees of greatness. “There are also some moving pictures by Gustave Moreau. My aunt is the niece of your friend Mme. de Ville-parisis; she was brought up by her, and married her cousin, who was a nephew, too, of my aunt Villeparisis, the present Duc de Guermantes.”

    “Then who is this uncle?”

    “He bears the title of Baron de Charlus. Properly speaking, when my great-uncle died, my uncle Palamède ought to have taken the title of Prince des Laumes, which his brother used before he became Duc de Guermantes, for in that family they change their names as you’d change your shirt. But my uncle has peculiar ideas about all that sort of thing. And as he feels that people are rather apt to overdo the Italian Prince and Grandee of Spain business nowadays, though he had half-a-dozen titles of ‘Prince’ to choose from, he has remained Baron de Charlus, as a protest, and with an apparent simplicity which really covers a good deal of pride. ‘In these days,’ he says, ‘everybody is Prince something-or-other; one really must have a title that will distinguish one; I shall call myself Prince when I wish to travel incognito.’ According to him there is no older title than the Charlus barony; to prove to you that it is earlier than the Montmorency title, though they used to claim, quite wrongly, to be the premier barons of France when they were only premier in the He de France, where their fief was, my uncle will explain to you for hours on end and enjoy doing it, because, although he’s a most intelligent man, really gifted, he regards that sort of thing as quite a live topic of conversation,” Saint-Loup smiled again. “But as I am not like him, you mustn’t ask me to talk pedigrees; I know nothing more deadly, more perishing; really, life is not long enough.”

   I now recognised in the hard look which had made me turn round that morning outside the Casino the same that I had seen fixed on me at Tan-sonville, at the moment when Mme. Swann called Gilberte away

    “But, I say, all those mistresses that, you told me, your uncle M. de Charlus had had, wasn’t Mme. Swann one of them?”

    “Good lord, no! That is to say, my uncle’s a great friend of Swann, and has always stood up for him. But no one has ever suggested that he was his wife’s lover. You would make a great sensation in Paris society if people thought you believed that.”

   I dared not reply that it would have caused an even greater sensation in Combray society if people had thought that I did not believe it

   My grandmother was delighted with M. de Charlus. No doubt he attached an extreme importance to all questions of birth and social position, and my grandmother had remarked this, but without any trace of that severity which as a rule embodies a secret envy and the annoyance of seeing some one else enjoy an advantage which one would like but cannot oneself possess. As on the other hand my grandmother, content with her lot and never for a moment regretting that she did not move in a more brilliant sphere, employed only her intellect in observing the eccentricities of M. de Charlus, she spoke of Saint-Loup’s uncle with that detached, smiling, almost affectionate kindness with which we reward the object of our disinterested study for the pleasure that it has given us, all the more that this time the object was a person with regard to whom she found that his if not legitimate, at any rate picturesque pretensions shewed him in vivid contrast to the people whom she generally had occasion to see. But it was especially in consideration of his intelligence and sensibility, qualities which it was easy to see that M. de Charlus, unlike so many of the people in society whom Saint-Loup derided, possessed in a marked degree, that my grandmother had so readily forgiven him his aristocratic prejudice. And yet this had not been sacrificed by the uncle, as it was by the nephew, to higher qualities. Rather, M. de Charlus had reconciled it with them. Possessing, by virtue of his descent from the Ducs de Nemours and Princes de Lamballe, documents, furniture, tapestries, portraits painted for his ancestors by Raphael, Velasquez, Boucher, justified in saying that he was visiting a museum and a matchless library when he was merely turning over his family relics at home, he placed in the rank from which his nephew had degraded it the whole heritage of the aristocracy. Perhaps also, being less metaphysical than Saint-Loup, less satisfied with words, more of a realist in his study of men, he did not care to neglect a factor that was essential to his prestige in their eyes and, if it gave certain disinterested pleasures to his imagination, could often be a powerfully effective aid to his utilitarian activities. No agreement can ever be reached between men of his sort and those who obey the ideal within them which urges them to strip themselves bare of such advantages so that they may seek only to realise that ideal, similar in that respect to the painters, the writers who renounce their virtuosity, the artistic peoples who modernise themselves, warrior peoples who take the initiative in a move for universal disarmament, absolute governments which turn democratic and repeal their harsh laws, though as often as not the sequel fails to reward their noble effort; for the men lose their talent, the nations their secular predominance; ‘pacificism’ often multiplies wars and indulgence criminality. If Saint-Loup’s efforts towards sincerity and emancipation were only to be commended as most noble, to judge by their visible result, one could still be thankful that they had failed to bear fruit in M. de Charlus, who had transferred to his own home much of the admirable panelling from the Guermantes house, instead of substituting, like his nephew, a ‘modern style’ of decoration, employing Lebourg or Guillaumin. It was none the less true that M. de Charlus’s ideal was highly artificial, and, if the epithet can be applied to the word ideal, as much social as artistic. In certain women of great beauty and rare culture whose ancestresses, two centuries earlier, had shared in all the glory and grace of the old order, he found a distinction which made him take pleasure only in their society, and no doubt the admiration for them which he had protested was sincere, but countless reminiscences; historical and artistic, called forth by their names, entered into and formed a great part of it, just as suggestions of classical antiquity are one of the reasons for the pleasure which a booklover finds in reading an Ode of Horace that is perhaps inferior to poems of our own day which would leave the same booklover cold. Any of these women by the side of a pretty commoner was for him what are, hanging beside a contemporary canvas representing a procession or a wedding, those old pictures the history of which we know, from the Pope or King who ordered them, through the hands of people whose acquisition of them, by gift, purchase, conquest or inheritance, recalls to us some event or at least some alliance of historic interest, and consequently some knowledge that we ourselves have acquired, gives it a fresh utility, increases our sense of the richness of the possessions of our memory or of our erudition. M. de Charlus might be thankful that a prejudice similar to his own, by preventing these several great ladies from mixing with women whose blood was less pure, presented them for his veneration unspoiled, in their unaltered nobility, like an eighteenth-century house-front supported on its flat columns of pink marble, in which the passage of time has wrought no change

   M. de Charlus praised the true ‘nobility’ of mind and heart which characterised these women, playing upon the word in a double sense by which he himself was taken in, and in which lay the falsehood of this bastard conception, of this medley of aristocracy, generosity and art, but also its seductiveness, dangerous to people like my grandmother, to whom the less refined but more innocent prejudice of a nobleman who cared only about quarterings and took no thought for anything besides would have appeared too silly for words, whereas she was defenceless as soon as a thing presented itself under the externals of a mental superiority, so much so, indeed, that she regarded Princes as enviable above all other men because they were able to have a Labruyère, a Fénelon as their tutors. Outside the Grand Hotel the three Guermantes left us; they were going to luncheon with the Princesse de Luxembourg. While my grandmother was saying good-bye to Mme. de Villcparisis and Saint-Loup to my grandmother, M. de Charlus who, so far, had not uttered a word to me, drew back a little way from the group and, when he reached my side, said: “I shall be taking tea this evening after dinner in my aunt Villeparisis’s room; I hope that you will give me the pleasure of seeing you there, and your grandmother.” With which he rejoined the Marquise

   Although it was Sunday there were no more carriages waiting outside the hotel now than at the beginning of the season. The solicitor’s wife, in particular, had decided that it was not worth the expense of hiring one every time simply because she was not going to the Cambremers’, and contented herself with staying in her room

    “Is Mme. Blandais not well?” her husband was asked. “We haven’t seen her all day.”

    “She has a slight headache; it’s the heat, there’s thunder coming. The least thing upsets her; but I expect you will see her this evening; I’ve told her she ought to come down. It can’t do her any harm.”

   I had supposed that in thus inviting us to take tea with his aunt, whom I never doubted that he would have warned that we were coming, M. de Charlus wished to make amends for the impoliteness which he had shewn me during our walk that morning. But when, on our entering Mme. de Villeparisis’s room, I attempted to greet her nephew, even although I walked right round him, while in shrill accents he was telling a somewhat spiteful story about one of his relatives, I did not succeed in catching his eye; I decided to say “Good evening” to him, and fairly loud, to warn him of my presence; but I realised that he had observed it, for before ever a word had passed my lips, just as I began to bow to him, I saw his two fingers stretched out for me to shake without his having turned to look at me or paused in his story. He had evidently seen me, without letting it appear that he had, and I noticed then that his eyes, which were never fixed on the person to whom he was speaking, strayed perpetually in all directions, like those of certain animals when they are frightened, or those of street hawkers who, while they are bawling their patter and displaying their illicit merchandise, keep a sharp look-out, though without turning their heads, on the different points of the horizon from any of which may appear, suddenly, the police. At the same time I was a little surprised to find that Mme. de Villeparisis, while glad to see us, did not seem to have been expecting us, and I was still more surprised to hear M. de Charlus say to my grandmother: “Ah! that was a capital idea of yours to come and pay us a visit; charming of them, is it not, my dear aunt?” No doubt he had noticed his aunt’s surprise at our entry and thought, as a man accustomed to set the tone, to strike the right note, that it would be enough to transform that surprise into joy were he to shew that he himself felt it, that it was indeed the feeling which our arrival there ought to have prompted. In which he calculated wisely; for Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a high opinion of her nephew and knew how difficult it was to please him, appeared suddenly to have found new attractions in my grandmother and continued to make much of her. But I failed to understand how M. de Charlus could, in the space of a few hours, have forgotten the invitation — so curt but apparently so intentional, so premeditated — which he had addressed to me that same morning, or why he called a ‘capital idea’ on my grandmother’s part an idea that had been entirely his own. With a scruple of accuracy which I retained until I had reached the age at which I realised that it is not by asking him questions that one learns the truth of what another man has had in his mind, and that the risk of a misunderstanding which will probably pass unobserved is less than that which may come from a purblind insistence: “But, sir,” I reminded him, “you remember, surely, that it was you who asked me if we would come in this evening?” Not a sound, not a movement betrayed that M. de Charlus had so much as heard my question. Seeing which I repeated it, like a diplomat, or like young men after a misunderstanding who endeavour, with untiring and unrewarded zeal, to obtain an explanation which their adversary is determined not to give them. Still M. de Charlus answered me not a word. I seemed to see hovering upon his lips the smile of those who from a great height pass judgment on the characters and breeding of their inferiors

   Since he refused to give any explanation, I tried to provide one for myself, but succeeded only in hesitating between several, none of which could be the right one. Perhaps he did not remember, or perhaps it was I who had failed to understand what he had said to me that morning. . . . More probably, in his pride, he did not wish to appear to have sought to attract people whom he despised, and preferred to cast upon them the responsibility for their intrusion. But then, if he despised us, why had he been so anxious that we should come, or rather that my grandmother should come, for of the two of us it was to her alone that he spoke that evening, and never once to me. Talking with the utmost animation to her, as also to Mme. de Villeparisis, hiding, so to speak, behind them, as though he were seated at the back of a theatre-box, he contented himself, turning from them every now and then the exploring gaze of his penetrating eyes, with fastening it on my face, with the same gravity, the same air of preoccupation as if my face had been a manuscript difficult to decipher

   No doubt, if he had not had those eyes, the face of M. de Charlus would have been similar to the faces of many good-looking men. And when Saint-Loup, speaking to me of various other Guermantes, on a later occasion, said: “Gad, they’ve not got that thoroughbred air, of being gentlemen to their finger-tips, that uncle Palamède has!” confirming my suspicion that a thoroughbred air and aristocratic distinction were not anything mysterious and new but consisted in elements which I had recognised without difficulty and without receiving any particular impression from them, I was to feel that another of my illusions had been shattered. But that face, to which a faint layer of powder gave almost the appearance of a face on the stage, in vain might M. de Charlus hermetically seal its expression; his eyes were like two crevices, two loopholes which alone he had failed to stop, and through which, according to where one stood or sat in relation to him, one felt suddenly flash across one the glow of some internal engine which seemed to offer no reassurance even to him who without being altogether master of it must carry it inside him, at an unstable equilibrium and always on the point of explosion; and the circumspect and unceasingly restless expression of those eyes, with all the signs of exhaustion which, extending from them to a pair of dark rings quite low down upon his cheeks, were stamped on his face, however carefully he might compose and regulate it, made one think of some incognito, some disguise assumed by a powerful mam in danger, or merely by a dangerous — but tragic — person. I should have liked to divine what was this secret which other men did not carry in their breasts and which had already made M. de Charlus’s gaze so enigmatic to me when I had seen him that morning outside the Casino. But with what I now knew of his family I could no longer believe that they were the eyes of a thief, nor, after what I had heard of his conversation, could I say that they were those of a madman. If he was cold with me, while making himself agreeable to my grandmother, that arose perhaps not from a personal antipathy for, generally speaking, just as he was kindly disposed towards women, of whose faults he used to speak without, as a rule, any narrowing of the broadest tolerance, so he shewed with regard to men, and especially young men, a hatred so violent as to suggest that of certain extreme misogynists for women. Two or three ‘carpet-knights,’ relatives or intimate friends of Saint-Loup who happened to mention their names, M. de Charlus, with an almost ferocious expression, in sharp contrast to his usual coldness, called: “Little cads!” I gathered that the particular fault which he found in the young men of the period was their extreme effeminacy. “They’re absolute women,” he said with scorn. But what life would not have appeared effeminate beside that which he expected a man to lead, and never found energetic or virile enough? (He himself, when he walked across country, after long hours on the road would plunge his heated body into frozen streams.) He would not even allow a man to wear a single ring. But this profession of virility did not prevent his having also the most delicate sensibilities. When Mme. de Villeparisis asked him to describe to my grandmother some country house in which Mme. de Sévigné had stayed, adding that she could not help feeling that there was something rather ‘literary’ about that lady’s distress at being parted from “that tiresome Mme. de Grignan”:

    “On the contrary,” he retorted, “I can think of nothing more true. Besides, it was a time in which feelings of that sort were thoroughly understood. The inhabitant of Lafontaine’s Monomotapa, running to see his friend who had appeared to him in a dream, and had looked sad, the pigeon finding that the greatest of evils is the absence of the other pigeon, seem to you perhaps, my dear aunt, as exaggerated as Mme. de Sévigné‘s impatience for the moment when she will be alone with her daughter. It is so fine what she says when she leaves her: ‘This parting gives a pain to my soul which I feel like an ache in my body. In absence one is liberal with the hours. One anticipates a time for which one is longing.’” My grandmother was in ecstasies at hearing the Letters thus spoken of, exactly as she would have spoken of them herself. She was astonished that a man could understand them so thoroughly. She found in M. de Charlus a delicacy, a sensibility that were quite feminine. We said to each other afterwards, when we were by ourselves and began to discuss him together, that he must have come under the strong influence of a woman, his mother, or in later life his daughter if he had any children. “A mistress, perhaps,” I thought to myself, remembering the influence that Saint-Loup’s seemed to have had over him, which enabled me to realise the point to which men can be refined by the women with whom they live

    “Once she was with her daughter, ^he had probably nothing to say to her,” put in Mme. de Villeparisis

    “Most certainly she had: if it was only what she calls ‘things so slight that nobody else would notice them but you and me.’ And anyhow she was with her. And Labruyère tells us that that is everything. ‘To be with the people one loves, to speak to them, not to speak to them, it is all the same.’ He is right; that is the only form of happiness,” added M. de Charlus in a mournful voice, “and that happiness — alas, life is so ill arranged that one very rarely tastes it; Mme. de Sévigné was after all less to be pitied than most of us. She spent a great part of her life with the person whom she loved.”

    “You forget that it was not ‘love’ in her case; the person was her daughter.”

    “But what matters in life is not whom or what one loves,” he went on, in a judicial, peremptory, almost a cutting tone; “it is the fact of loving. What Mme. de Sévigné felt for her daughter has a far better claim to rank with the passion that Racine described in Andromaque or Phèdre than the commonplace relations young Sévigné had with his mistresses. It’s the same with a mystic’s love for his God. The hard and fast lines with which we circumscribe love arise solely from our complete ignorance of life.”

    “You think all that of Andromaque and Phèdre, do you?” Saint-Loup asked his uncle in a faintly contemptuous tone. “There is more truth in a single tragedy of Racine than in all the dramatic works of Monsieur Victor Hugo,” replied M. de Charlus. “People really are overwhelming,” Saint-Loup murmured in my ear. “Preferring Racine to Victor, you may say what you like, it’s epoch-making!” He was genuinely distressed by his uncle’s words, but the satisfaction of saying “you may say what you like” and, better still, “epoch-making” consoled him

   In these reflexions upon the sadness of having to live apart from the person whom one loves (which were to lead my grandmother to say to me that Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew understood certain things quite as well as his aunt, but in a different way, and moreover had something about him that set him far above the average clubman) M. de Charlus not only allowed a refinement of feeling to appear such as men rarely shew; his voice itself, like certain contralto voices which have not been properly trained to the right pitch, so that when they sing it sounds like a duet between a young man and a woman, singing alternately, mounted, when he expressed these delicate sentiments, to its higher notes, took on an unexpected sweetness and seemed to be embodying choirs of betrothed maidens, of sisters, who poured out the treasures of their love. But the bevy of young girls, whom M. de Charlus in his horror of every kind of effeminacy would have been so distressed to learn that he gave the impression of sheltering thus within his voice, did not confine themselves to the interpretation, the modulation of scraps of sentiment. Often while M. de Charlus was talking one could hear their laughter, shrill, fresh laughter of school-girls or coquettes quizzing their partners with all the archness of clever tongues and pretty wits

   He told us how a house that had belonged to his family, in which Marie Antoinette had slept, with a park laid out by Lenôtre, was now in the hands of the Israels, the wealthy financiers, who had bought it. “Israel — at least that is the name these people go by, which seems to me a generic, a racial term rather than a proper name. One cannot tell; possibly people of that sort do not have names, and are designated only by the collective title of the tribe to which they belong. It is of no importance! But fancy, after being a home of the Guermantes, to belong to Israels!!!” His voice rose. “It reminds me of a room in the Château of Blois where the caretaker who was shewing me over said: ‘This is where Mary Stuart used to say her prayers; I use it to keep my brooms in.’ Naturally I wish to know nothing more of this house that has let itself be dishonoured, any more than of my cousin Clara de Chimay after she left her husband. But I keep a photograph of the house, when it was still unspoiled, just as I keep one of the Princess before her large eyes had learned to gaze on anyone but my cousin. A photograph acquires something of the dignity which it ordinarily lacks when it ceases to be a reproduction of reality and shews us things that no longer exist. I could give you a copy, since you are interested in that style of architecture,” he said to my grandmother. At that moment, noticing that the embroidered handkerchief which he had in his pocket was shewing some coloured threads, he thrust it sharply down out of sight with the scandalised air of a prudish but far from innocent lady concealing attractions which, by an excess of scrupulosity, she regards as indecent. “Would you believe,” he went on, “that the first thing the creatures did was to destroy Lenôtre’s park, which is as bad as slashing a picture by Poussin? For that alone, these Israels ought to be in prison. It is true,” he added with a smile, after a moment’s silence, “that there are probably plenty of other reasons why they should be there! In any case, you can imagine the effect, with that architecture behind it, of an English garden.”

    “But the house is in the same style as the Petit Trianon,” said Mme. de Villeparisis, “and Marie-Antoinette had an English garden laid out there.”

    “Which, all the same, ruins Gabriel’s front,” replied M. de Charlus. “Obviously, it would be an act of vandalism now to destroy the Hameau. But whatever may be the spirit of the age, I doubt, all the same, whether, in that respect, a whim of Mme. Israel has the same importance as the memory of the Queen.”

   Meanwhile my grandmother had been making signs to me to go up to bed, in spite of the urgent appeals of Saint-Loup who, to my utter confusion, had alluded in front of M. de Charlus to the depression that used often to come upon me at night before I went to sleep, which his uncle must regard as betokening a sad want of virility. I lingered a few moments still, then went upstairs, and was greatly surprised when, a little later, having heard a knock at my bedroom door and asked who was there, I heard the voice of M. de Charlus saying dryly:

    “It is Charlus. May I come in, sir? Sir,” he began again in the same tone as soon as he had shut the door, “my nephew was saying just now that you were apt to be worried at night before going to sleep, and also that you were an admirer of Bergotte’s books. As I had one here in my luggage which you probably do not know, I have brought it to help you to while away these moments in which you are not comfortable.”

   I thanked M. de Charlus with some warmth and told him that, on the contrary, I had been afraid that what Saint-Loup had said to him about my discomfort when night came would have made me appear in his eyes more stupid even than I was

    “No; why?” he answered, in a gentler voice. “You have not, perhaps, any personal merit; so few of us have! But for a time at least you have youth, and that is always a charm. Besides, sir, the greatest folly of all is to laugh at or to condemn in others what one does not happen oneself to feel. I love the night, and you tell me that you are afraid of it. I love the scent of roses, and I have a friend whom it throws into a fever. Do you suppose that I think, for that reason, that he is inferior to me? I try to understand everything and I take care to condemn nothing. After all, you must not be too sorry for yourself; I do not say that these moods of depression are not painful, I know that one can be made to suffer by things which the world would not understand. But at least you have placed your affection wisely, in your grandmother. You see a great deal of her. And besides, that is a legitimate affection, I mean one that is repaid. There are so many of which one cannot say that.”

   He began walking up and down the room, looking at one thing, taking up another. I had the impression that he had something to tell me, and could not find the right words to express it

    “I have another volume of Bergotte here; I will fetch it for you,” he went on, and rang the bell. Presently a page came. “Go and find me your head waiter. He is the only person here who is capable of obeying an order intelligently,” said M. de Charlus stiffly. “Monsieur Aimé, sir?” asked the page. “I cannot tell you his name; yes, I remember now, I did hear him called Aimé. Run along, I am in a hurry.” “He won’t be a minute, sir, I saw him downstairs just now,” said the page, anxious to appear efficient. There was an interval of silence. The page returned. “Sir, M. Aimé has gone to bed. But I can take your message.” “No, you have only to get him out of bed.” “But I can’t do that, sir; he doesn’t sleep here.” “Then you can leave us alone.” “But, sir,” I said when the page had gone, “you are too kind; one volume of Bergotte will be quite enough.” “That is just what I was thinking.” M. de Charlus walked up and down the room. Several minutes passed in this way, then after a prolonged hesitation, and several false starts, he swung sharply round and, his voice once more stinging, flung at me: “Good night, sir!” and left the room. After all the lofty sentiments which I had heard him express that evening, next day, which was the day of his departure, on the beach, before noon, when I was on my way down to bathe, and M. de Charlus had come across to tell me that my grandmother was waiting for me to join her as soon as I left the water, I was greatly surprised to hear him say, pinching my neck as he spoke, with a familiarity and a laugh that were frankly vulgar:

    “But he doesn’t give a damn for his old grandmother, does he, eh? Little rascal!”

    “What, sir! I adore her!”

    “Sir,” he said, stepping back a pace, and with a glacial air, “you are still young; you should profit by your youth to learn two things; first, to refrain from expressing sentiments that are too natural not to be taken for granted; and secondly not to dash into speech to reply to things that are said to you before you have penetrated their meaning. If you had taken this precaution a moment ago you would have saved yourself the appearance of speaking at cross-purposes like a deaf man, thereby adding a second absurdity to that of having anchors embroidered on your bathing-dress. I have lent you a book by Bergotte which I require. See that it is brought to me within the next hour by that head waiter with the silly and inappropriate name, who, I suppose, is not in bed at this time of day. You make me see that I was premature in speaking to you last night of the charms of youth; I should have done you a better service had I pointed out to you its thoughtlessness, its inconsequence, and its want of comprehension. I hope, sir, that this little douche will be no less salutary to you than your bathe. But don’t let me keep you standing: you may catch cold. Good day, sir.”

   No doubt he was sorry afterwards for this speech, for some time later I received — in a morocco binding on the front of which was inlaid a panel of tooled leather representing in demi-relief a spray of forget-me-nots — the book which he had lent me, and I had sent back to him, not by Aimé who was apparently ‘off duty,’ but by the lift-boy

   M. de Charlus having gone, Robert and I were free at last to dine with Bloch. And I realised during this little party that the stories too readily admitted by our friend as funny were favourite stories of M. Bloch senior, and that the son’s ‘really remarkable person’ was always one of his father’s friends whom he had so classified. There are a certain number of people whom we admire in our boyhood, a father with better brains than the rest of the family, a teacher who acquires credit in our eyes from the philosophy he reveals to us, a schoolfellow more advanced than we are (which was what Bloch had been to me), who despises the Musset of the Espoir en Dieu when we still admire it, and when we have reached Le-conte or Claudel will be in ecstasies only over:

                         A Saint-Biaise, à la Zuecca
                          Vous étiez, vous étiez bien aise:

With which he will include:

                          Padoue est un fort bel endroit
                          Où de très grands docteurs en droit
                          Mais j’aime mieux la polenta
                          Passe dans mon domino noir
                          La Toppatelle

And of all the Nuits will remember only:

                          Au Havre, devant l’Atlantique
                          A Venise, à l’affreux Lido
                          Où vient sur l’herbe d’un tombeau
                          Mourir la pâle Adriatique

   So, whenever we confidently admire anyone, we collect from him, we quote with admiration sayings vastly inferior to the sort which, left to our own judgment, we would sternly reject, just as the writer of a novel puts into it, on the pretext that they are true, things which people have actually said, which in the living context are like a dead weight, form the dull part of the work. Saint-Simon’s portraits composed by himself (and very likely without his admiring them himself) are admirable, whereas what he cites as the charming wit of his clever friends is frankly dull where it has not become meaningless. He would have scorned to invent what he reports as so pointed or so coloured when said by Mme. Cornuel or Louis XIV, a point which is to be remarked also in many other writers, and is capable of various interpretations, of which it is enough to note but one for the present: namely, that in the state of mind in which we ‘observe’ we are a long way below the level to which we rise when we create

   There was, then, embedded in my friend Bloch a father Bloch who lagged forty years behind his son, told impossible stories and laughed as loudly at them from the heart of my friend as did’ the separate, visible and authentic father Bloch, since to the laugh which the latter emitted, not without several times repeating the last word so that his public might taste the full flavour of the story, was added the braying laugh with which the son never failed, at table, to greet his father’s anecdotes. Thus it came about that after saying the most intelligent things young Bloch, to indicate the portion that he had inherited from his family, would tell us for the thirtieth time some of the gems which father Bloch brought out only (with his swallow-tail coat) on the solemn occasions on which young Bloch brought someone to the house on whom it was worth while making an impression; one of his masters, a ‘chum’ who had taken all the prizes, or, this evening, Saint-Loup and myself. For instance: “A military critic of great insight, who had brilliantly worked out, supporting them with proofs, the reasons for which, in the Russo-Japanese war, the Japanese must inevitably be beaten and the Russians victorious,” or else: “He is an eminent gentleman who passes for a great financier in political circles and for a great politician among financiers.” These stories were interchangeable with one about Baron de Rothschild and one about Sir Rufus Israels, who were brought into the conversation in an equivocal manner which might let it be supposed that M. Bloch knew them personally

   I was myself taken in, and from the way in which M. Bloch spoke of Bergotte I assumed that he too was an old friend. But with him as with all famous people, M. Bloch knew them only ‘without actually knowing them,’ from having seen them at a distance in the theatre or in the street. He imagined, moreover, that his appearance, his name, his personality were not unknown to them, and that when they caught sight of him they had often to repress a stealthy inclination to bow. People in society, because they know men of talent, original characters, and have them to dine in their houses, do not on that account understand them any better. But when one has lived to some extent in society, the silliness of its inhabitants makes one too anxious to live, suppose too high a standard of intelligence in the obscure circles in which people know only ‘without actually knowing.’ I was to discover this when I introduced the topic of Bergotte. M. Bloch was not the only one who was a social success at home. My friend was even more so with his sisters, whom he continually questioned in a hectoring tone, burying his face in his plate, all of which made them laugh until they cried. They had adopted their brother’s language, and spoke it fluently, as if it had been obligatory and the only form of speech that people of intelligence might use. When we arrived, the eldest sister said to one of the younger ones: “Go, tell our sage father and our venerable mother!” “Puppies,” said Bloch, “I present to you the cavalier Saint-Loup, hurler of javelins, who is come for a few days from Doncières to the dwellings of polished stone, fruitful in horses.” And, since he was as vulgar as he was literary, his speech ended as a rule in some pleasantry of a less Homeric kind: “See, draw closer your pepla with fair clasps, what is all that that I see? Does your mother know you’re out?” And the Misses Bloch subsided in a tempest of laughter. I told their brother how much pleasure he had given me by recommending me to read Bergotte, whose books I had loved

   M. Bloch senior, who knew Bergotte only by sight, and Bergotte’s life only from what was common gossip, had a manner quite as indirect of making the acquaintance of his books, by the help of criticisms that were apparently literary. He lived in the world of ‘very nearlies,’ where people salute the empty air and arrive at wrong judgments. Inexactitude, incompetence do not modify their assurance; quite the contrary. It is the propitious miracle of self-esteem that, since few of us are in a position to enjoy the society of distinguished people, or to form intellectual friendships, those to whom they are denied still believe themselves to be the best endowed of men, because the optics of our social perspective make every grade of society seem the best to him who occupies it, and beholds as less favoured than himself, less fortunate and therefore to be pitied, the greater men whom he names and calumniates without knowing, judges and — despises without understanding them. Even in cases where the multiplication of his modest personal advantages by his self-esteem would not suffice to assure a man the dose of happiness, superior to that accorded to others, which is essential to him, envy is always there to make up the balance. It is true that if envy finds expression in scornful phrases, we must translate ‘I have no wish to know him’ by ‘I have no means of knowing him.’ That is the intellectual sense. But the emotional sense is indeed, ‘I have no wish to know him.’ The speaker knows that it is not true, but he does not, all the same, say it simply to deceive; he says it because it is what he feels, and that is sufficient to bridge the gulf between them, that is to say to make him happy

   Self-centredness thus enabling every human being to see the universe spread out in a descending scale beneath himself who is its lord, M. Bloch afforded himself the luxury of being pitiless when in the morning, as he drank his chocolate, seeing Bergotte’s signature at the foot of an article in the newspaper which he had scarcely opened, he disdainfully granted the writer an audience soon cut short, pronounced sentence upon him, and gave himself the comforting pleasure of repeating after every mouthful of the scalding brew: “That fellow Bergotte has become unreadable. My word, what a bore the creature can be. I really must stop my subscription. How involved it all is, bread and butter nonsense!” And he helped himself to another slice

   This illusory importance of M. Bloch senior did, moreover, extend some little way beyond the radius of his own perceptions. In the first place his children regarded him as a superior person. Children have always a tendency either to depreciate or to exalt their parents, and to a good son his father is always the best of fathers, quite apart from any objective reason there may be for admiring him. Now, such reasons were not altogether lacking in the case of M. Bloch, who was an educated man, shrewd, affectionate towards his family. In his most intimate circle they were all the more proud of him because, if, in ‘society,’ people are judged by a standard (which is incidentally absurd) and according to false but fixed rules, by comparison with the aggregate of all the other fashionable people, in the subdivisions of middle-class life, on the other hand, the dinners, the family parties all turn upon certain people who are pronounced good company, amusing, and who in ‘society’ would not survive a second evening. Moreover in such an environment where the artificial values of the aristocracy do not exist, their place is taken by distinctions even more stupid. Thus it was that in his family circle, and even among the remotest branches of the tree, an alleged similarity in his way of wearing his moustache and in the bridge of his nose led to M. Bloch’s being called “the Due d’Aumale’s double.” (In the world of club pages, the one who wears his cap on one side and his jacket tightly buttoned, so as to give himself the appearance, he imagines, of a foreign officer, is he not also a personage of a sort to his comrades?)

   The resemblance was the faintest, but you would have said that it conferred a title. When he was mentioned, it would always be: “Bloch? Which one? The Due d’Aumale?” as people say “Princesse Murât? Which one? The Queen (of Naples)?” And there were certain other minute marks which combined to give him, in the eyes of the cousinhood, an acknowledged claim to distinction. Not going the length of having a carriage of his own, M. Bloch used on special occasions to hire an open victoria with a pair of horses from the Company, and would drive through the Bois de Boulogne, his body sprawling limply from side to side, two fingers pressed to his brow, other two supporting his chin, and if people who did not know him concluded that he was an ‘old nuisance,’ they were all convinced, in the family, that for smartness Uncle Solomon could have taught Gramont-Caderousse a thing or two. He was one of those people who when they die, because for years they have shared a table in a restaurant on the boulevard with its news-editor, are described as “well known Paris figures” in the social column of the Radical. M. Bloch told Saint-Loup and me that Bergotte knew so well why he, M. Bloch, always cut him that as soon as he caught sight of him, at the theatre or in the club, he avoided his eye. Saint-Loup blushed, for it had occurred to him that this club could not be the Jockey, of which his father had been chairman. On the other hand it must be a fairly exclusive club, for M. Bloch had said that Bergotte would never have got into it if he had come up now. So it was not without the fear that he might be ‘underrating his adversary’ that Saint-Loup asked whether the club in question were the Rue Royale, which was considered ‘lowering’ by his own family, and to which he knew that certain Israelites had been admitted. “No,” replied M. Bloch in a tone at once careless, proud and ashamed, “it is a small club, but far more pleasant than a big one, the Ganaches. We’re very strict there, don’t you know.” “Isn’t Sir Rufus Israels the chairman?” Bloch junior asked his father, so as to give him the opportunity for a glorious lie, never suspecting that the financier had not the same eminence in Saint-Loup’s eyes as in his. The fact of the matter was that the Ganaches club boasted not Sir Rufus Israels but one of his staff. But as this man was on the best of terms with his employer, he had at his disposal a stock of the financier’s cards, and would give one to M. Bloch whenever he wished to travel on a line of which Sir Rufus was a director, the result of which was that old Bloch would say: “I’m just going round to the Club to ask Sir Rufus for a line to the Company.” And the card enabled him to dazzle the guards on the trains. The Misses Bloch were more interested in Bergotte and, reverting to him rather than pursue the subject of the Ganaches, the youngest asked her brother, in the most serious tone imaginable, for she believed that there existed in the world, for the designation of men of talent, no other terms than those which he was in the habit of using: “Is he really an amazing good egg, this Bergotte? Is he in the category of the great lads, good eggs like Villiers and Catullus?” “I’ve met him several times at dress rehearsals,” said M. Nissim Bernard. “He is an uncouth creature, a sort of Schlemihl.” There was nothing very serious in this allusion to Chamisso’s story but the epithet ‘Schlemihl’ formed part of that dialect, half-German, half-Jewish, the use of which delighted M. Bloch in the family circle, but struck him as vulgar and out of place before strangers. And so he cast a reproving glance at his uncle. “He has talent,” said Bloch. “Ah!” His sister sighed gravely, as though to imply that in that case there was some excuse for me. “All writers have talent,” said M. Bloch scornfully. “In fact it appears,” went on his son, raising his fork, and screwing up his eyes with an air of impish irony, “that he is going to put up for the Academy.” “Go on. He hasn’t enough to shew them,” replied his father, who seemed not to have for the Academy the same contempt as his son and daughters. “He’s not big enough.” “Besides, the Academy is a salon, and Bergotte has no polish,” declared the uncle (whose heiress Mme. Bloch was), a mild and inoffensive person whose surname, Bernard, might perhaps by itself have quickened my grandfather’s powers of diagnosis, but would have appeared too little in harmony with a face which looked as if it had been brought back from Darius’s palace and restored by Mme. Dieulafoy, had not (chosen by some collector desirous of giving a crowning touch of orientalism to this figure from Susa) his first name, Nissim, stretched out above it the pinions of an androcephalous bull from Khorsabad. But M. Bloch never stopped insulting his uncle, whether it was that he was excited by the unresisting good-humour of his butt, or that the rent of the villa being paid by M. Nissim Bernard, the beneficiary wished to shew that he kept his independence, and, more important still, that he was not seeking by flattery to make sure of the rich inheritance to come. What most hurt the old man was being treated so rudely in front of the manservant. He murmured an unintelligible sentence of which all that could be made out was: “when the meschores are in the room.” ‘Meschores,’ in the Bible, means ‘the servant of God.’ In the family circle the Blochs used the word when they referred to their own servants, and were always exhilarated by it, because their certainty of not being understood either by Christians or by the servants themselves enhanced in M. Nissim Bernard and M. Bloch their twofold distinction of being ‘masters’ and at the same time ‘Jews.’ But this latter source of satisfaction became a source of displeasure when there was ‘company.’ At such times M. Bloch, hearing his uncle say ‘meschores,’ felt that he was making his oriental side too prominent, just as a light-of-love who has invited some of her sisters to meet her respectable friends is annoyed if they allude to their profession or use words that do not sound quite nice. Therefore, so far from his uncle’s request’s producing any effect on M. Bloch, he, beside himself with rage, could contain himself no longer. He let no opportunity pass of scarifying his wretched uncle. “Of course, when there is a chance of saying anything stupid, one can be quite certain that you won’t miss it. You would be the first to lick his boots if he were in the room!” shouted M. Bloch, while M. Nissim Bernard in sorrow lowered over his plate the ringleted beard of King Sargon. My friend, when he began to grow his beard, which also was blue-black and crimped, became very like his great-uncle

    “What! Are you the son of the Marquis de Marsantes? Why, I knew him very well,” said M. Nissim Bernard to Saint-Loup. I supposed that he meant the word ‘knew’ in the sense in which Bloch’s father had said that he knew Bergotte, namely by sight. But he went on: “Your father was one of my best friends.” Meanwhile Bloch had turned very red, his father was looking intensely cross, the Misses Bloch were choking with suppressed laughter. The fact was that in M. Nissim Bernard the love of ostentation which in M. Bloch and his children was held in cheek, had engendered the habit of perpetual lying. For instance, if he was staying in an hotel, M. Nissim Bernard, as M. Bloch equally might have done, would have his newspapers brought to him always by his valet in the dining-room, in the middle of luncheon, when everybody was there, so that they should see that he travelled with a valet. But to the people with whom he made friends in the hotel the uncle used to say what the nephew would never have said, that he was a Senator. He might know quite well that they would sooner or later discover that the title was usurped; he could not, at the critical moment, resist the temptation to assume it. M. Bloch suffered acutely from his uncle’s lies and from all the embarrassments that they led to. “Don’t pay any attention to him, he talks a great deal of nonsense,” he whispered to Saint-Loup, whose interest was all the more whetted, for he was curious to explore the psychology of liars. “A greater liar even than the Ithacan Odysseus, albeit Athene called him the greatest liar among mortals,” his son completed the indictment. “Well, upon my word!” cried M. Nissim Bernard, “If I’d only known that I was going to sit down to dinner with my old friend’s son! Why, I have a photograph still of your father at home, in Paris, and any number of letters from him. He used always to call me ‘uncle,’ nobody ever knew why. He was a charming man, sparkling. I remember so well a dinner I gave at Nice; there were Sardou, Labiche, Augier,” “Molière, Racine, Corneille,” M. Bloch added with sarcasm, while his son completed the tale of guests with “Plautus, Menander, Kalidasa.” M. Nissim Bernard, cut to the quick, stopped short in his reminiscence, and, ascetically depriving himself of a great pleasure, remained silent until the end of dinner

    “Saint-Loup with helm of bronze,” said Bloch, “have a piece more of this duck with thighs heavy with fat, over which the illustrious sacrificer of birds has spilled numerous libations of red wine.”

   As a rule, after bringing out from his store for the entertainment of a distinguished guest his anecdotes of Sir Rufus Israels and others, M. Bloch, feeling that he had succeeded in touching and melting his son’s heart, would withdraw, so as not to spoil his effect in the eyes of the ‘big pot.’ If, however, there was an absolutely compelling reason, as for instance on the night when his son won his fellowship, M. Bloch would add to the usual string of anecdotes the following ironical reflexion which he ordinarily reserved for his own personal friends, so that young Bloch was extremely proud to see it produced for his: “The Government have acted unpardonably. They have forgotten to consult M. Coquelin! M. Coquelin has let it be known that he is displeased.” (M. Bloch prided himself on being a reactionary, with a contempt for theatrical people.)

   But the Misses Bloch and their brother reddened to the tips of their ears, so much impressed were they when Bloch senior, to shew that he could be regal to the last in his entertainment of his son’s two ‘chums,’ gave the order for champagne to be served, and announced casually that, as a treat for us, he had taken three stalls for the performance which a company from the Opéra-Comique was giving that evening at the Casino. He was sorry that he had not been able to get a box. They had all been taken. However, he had often been in the boxes, and really one saw and heard better down by the orchestra. All very well, only, if the defect of his son, that is to say the defect which his son believed to be invisible to other people, was coarseness, the father’s was avarice. And so it was in a decanter that we were served with, under the name of champagne, a light sparkling wine, while under that of orchestra stalls he had taken three in the pit, which cost half as much, miraculously persuaded by the divine intervention of his defect that neither at table nor in the theatre (where the boxes were all empty) would the defect be noticed. When M. Bloch had let us moisten our lips in the flat glasses which his son dignified with the style and title of ‘craters with deeply hollowed flanks,’ he made us admire a picture to which he was so much attached that he had brought it with him to Balbec. He told us that it was a Rubens. Saint-Loup asked innocently if it was signed. M. Bloch replied, blushing, that he had had the signature cut off to make it fit the frame, but that it made no difference, as he had no intention of selling the picture. Then he hurriedly bade us good-night, in order to bury himself in the Journal Officiel, back numbers of which littered the house, and which, he informed us, he was obliged to read carefully on account of his ‘parliamentary position’ as to the precise nature of which, however, he gave us no enlightenment. “I shall take a muffler,” said Bloch, “for Zephyrus and Boreas are disputing to which of them shall belong the fish-teeming sea, and should we but tarry a little after the show is over, we shall not be home before the first flush of Eos, the rosy-fingered. By the way,” he asked Saint-Loup when we were outside, and I trembled, for I realised at once that it was of M. de Charlus that Bloch was speaking in that tone of irony, “who was that excellent old card dressed in black that I saw you walking with, the day before yesterday, on the beach?” “That was my uncle.” Saint-Loup was ruffled. Unfortunately, a ‘floater’ was far from seeming to Bloch a thing to be avoided. He shook with laughter. “Heartiest congratulations; I ought to have guessed; he has an excellent style, the most priceless dial of an old ‘gaga’ of the highest lineage.” “You are absolutely mistaken; he is an extremely clever man,” retorted Saint-Loup, now furious. “I am sorry about that; it makes him less complete. All the same, I should like very much to know him, for I flatter myself I could write some highly adequate pieces about old buffers like that. Just to see him go by, he’s killing. But I should leave out of account the caricaturable side, which really is hardly worthy of an artist enamoured of the plastic beauty of phrases, of his mug, which (you’ll forgive me) doubled me up for a moment with joyous laughter, and I should bring into prominence the aristocratic side of your uncle, who after all has a distinct bovine effect, and when one has finished laughing does impress one by his great air of style. But,” he went on, addressing myself this time, “there is also a matter of a very different order about which I have been meaning to question you, and every time we are together, some god, blessed denizen of Olympus, makes me completely forget to ask for a piece of information which might before now have been and is sure some day to be of the greatest use to me. Tell me, who was the lovely lady I saw you with in the Jardin d’Acclimatation accompanied by a gentleman whom I seem to know by sight and a little girl with long hair?” It had been quite plain to me at the time that Mme. Swann did not remember Bloch’s name, since she had spoken of him by another, and had described my friend as being on the staff of some Ministry, as to which I had never since then thought of finding out whether he had joined it. But how came it that Bloch, who, according to what she then told me, had got himself introduced to her, was ignorant of her name? I was so much surprised that I stopped for a moment before answering. “Whoever she is,” he went on, “hearty congratulations; you can’t have been bored with her. I picked her up a few days before that on the Zone railway, where, speaking of zones, she was so kind as to undo hers for the benefit of your humble servant; I have never had such a time in my life, and we were just going to make arrangements to meet again when somebody she knew had the bad taste to get in at the last station but one.” My continued silence did not appear to please Bloch. “I was hoping,” he said, “thanks to you, to learn her address, so as to go there several times a week to taste in her arms the delights of Eros, dear to the gods; but I do not insist since you seem pledged to discretion with respect to a professional who gave herself to me three times running, and in the most refined manner, between Paris and the Point-du-Jour. I am bound to see her again, some night.”

   I called upon Bloch after this dinner; he returned my call, but I was out and he was seen asking for me by Françoise, who, as it happened, albeit he had visited us at Combray, had never set eyes on him until then. So that she knew only that one of ‘the gentlemen’ who were friends of mine had looked in to see me, she did not know ‘with what object,’ dressed in a nondescript way, which had not made any particular impression upon her. Now though I knew quite well that certain of Françoise’s social ideas must for ever remain impenetrable by me, ideas based, perhaps, partly upon confusions between words, between names which she had once and for all time mistaken for one another, I could not restrain myself, who had long since abandoned the quest for enlightenment in such cases, from seeking — and seeking, moreover, in vain — to discover what could be the immense significance that the name of Bloch had for Françoise. For no sooner had I mentioned to her that the young man whom she had seen was M. Bloch than she recoiled several paces, so great were her stupor and disappointment. “What! Is that M. Bloch?” she cried, thunderstruck, as if so portentous a personage ought to have been endowed with an appearance which ‘made you know’ as soon as you saw him that you were in the presence of one of the great ones of the earth; and, like some one who has discovered that an historical character is not ‘up to’ the level of his reputation, she repeated in an impressed tone, in which I could detect latent, for future growth, the seeds of a universal scepticism: “What! Is that M. Bloch? Well, really, you would never think it, to look at him.” She seemed also to bear me a grudge, as if I had always ‘overdone’ the praise of Bloch to her. At the same time she was kind enough to add: “Well, he may be M. Bloch, and all that. I’m sure Master can say he’s every bit as good.”

   She had presently, with respect to Saint-Loup, whom she worshipped, a disillusionment of a different kind and of less severity: she discovered that he was a Republican. Now for all that, when speaking, for instance, of the Queen of Portugal, she would say with that disrespect which is, among the people, the supreme form of respect: “Amélie, Philippe’s sister,” Françoise was a Royalist. But when it came to a Marquis; a Marquis who had dazzled her at first sight, and who was for the Republic, seemed no longer real. And she shewed the same ill-humour as if I had given her a box which she had believed to be made of gold, and had thanked me for it effusively, and then a jeweller had revealed to her that it was only plated. She at once withdrew her esteem from Saint-Loup, but soon afterwards restored it to him, having reflected that he could not, being the Marquis de Saint-Loup, be a Republican, that he was just pretending, in his own interest, for with such a Government as we had it might be a great advantage to him. From that moment her coldness towards him, her resentment towards myself ceased. And when she spoke of Saint-Loup she said: “He is a hypocrite,” with a broad and friendly smile which made it clear that she ‘considered’ him again just as much as when she first knew him, and that she had forgiven him

   As a matter of fact, Saint-Loup was absolutely sincere and disinterested, and it was this intense moral purity which, not being able to find entire satisfaction in a selfish sentiment such as love, nor on the other hand meeting in him the impossibility (which existed in me, for instance) of finding its spiritual nourishment elsewhere than in himself, rendered him truly capable (just as I was incapable) of friendship

   Françoise was no less mistaken about Saint-Loup when she complained that he had that sort of air, as if he did not look down upon the people, but that it was all just a pretence, and you had only to see him when he was in a temper with his groom. It had indeed sometimes happened that Robert would scold his groom with a certain amount of brutality, which proved that he had the sense not so much of the difference as of the equality between classes and masses. “But,” he said in answer to my rebuke of his having treated the man rather harshly, “why should I go out of my way to speak politely to him? Isn’t he my equal? Isn’t he just as near to me as any of my uncles and cousins? You seem to think that I ought to treat him with respect, as an inferior. You talk like an aristocrat!” he added scornfully

   And indeed if there was a class to which he shewed himself prejudiced and hostile, it was the aristocracy, so much so that he found it as hard to believe in the superior qualities of a man in society as he found it easy to believe in those of a man of the people. When I mentioned the Princesse de Luxembourg, whom I had met with his aunt:

    “An old trout,” was his comment. “Like all that lot. She’s a sort of cousin of mine, by the way.”

   Having a strong prejudice against the people who frequented it, he went rarely into ‘Society,’ and the contemptuous or hostile attitude which he adopted towards it served to increase, among all his near relatives, the painful impression made by his intimacy with a woman on the stage, a connexion which, they declared, would be his ruin, blaming it specially for having bred in him that spirit of denigration, that bad spirit, and for having led him astray, after which it was only a matter of time before he would have dropped out altogether. And so, many easy-going men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain were without compunction when they spoke of Robert’s mistress. “Those girls do their job,” they would say, “they are as good as anybody else. But that one; no, thank youl We cannot forgive her. She has done too much harm to a fellow we were fond of.” Of course, he was not the first to be caught in that snare. But the others amused themselves like men of the world, continued to think like men of the world about politics, about everything. As for him, his family found him ‘soured.’ They did not bear in mind that, for many young men of fashion who would otherwise remain uncultivated mentally, rough in their friendships, without gentleness or taste — it is very often their mistress who is their real master, and connexions of this sort the only school of morals in which they are initiated into a superior culture, and learn the value of disinterested relations. Even among the lower orders (who, when it comes to coarseness, so often remind us of the world of fashion) the woman, more sensitive, finer, more leisured, is driven by curiosity to adopt certain refinements, respects certain beauties of sentiment and of art which, though she may fail to understand them, she nevertheless places above what has seemed most desirable to the man, above money or position. Now whether the mistress be a young blood’s (such as Saint-Loup) or a young workman’s (electricians, for instance, must now be included in our truest order of Chivalry) her lover has too much admiration and respect for her not to extend them also to what she herself respects and admires; and for him the scale of values is thereby reversed. Her sex alone makes her weak; she suffers from nervous troubles, inexplicable things which in a man, or even in another woman — a woman whose nephew or cousin he was — would bring a smile to the lips of this stalwart young man. But he cannot bear to see her suffer whom he loves. The young nobleman who, like Saint-Loup, has a mistress acquires the habit, when he takes her out to dine, of carrying in his pocket the valerian ‘drops’ which she may need, of ordering the waiter, firmly and with no hint of sarcasm, to see that he shuts the doors quietly and not to put any damp moss on the table, so as to spare his companion those discomforts which himself he has never felt, which compose for him an occult world in whose reality she has taught him to believe, discomforts for which he now feels pity without in the least needing to understand them, for which he will still feel pity when other women than she shall be the sufferers. Saint-Loup’s mistress — as the first monks of the middle ages taught Christendom — had taught him to be kind to animals, for which she had a passion, never moving without her dog, her canaries, her love-birds; Saint-Loup looked after them with motherly devotion and treated as brutes the people who were not good to dumb creatures. On the other hand, an actress, or so-called actress, like this one who was living with him — whether she were intelligent or not, and as to that I had no knowledge — by making him find the society of fashionable women boring, and look upon having to go out to a party as a painful duty, had saved him from snobbishness and cured him of frivolity. If, thanks to her, his social engagements filled a smaller place in the life of her young lover, at the same time, whereas if he had been simply a drawing-room man, vanity or self-interest would have dictated his choice of friends as rudeness would have characterised his treatment of them, his mistress had taught him to bring nobility and refinement into his friendship. With her feminine instinct, with a keener appreciation in men of certain qualities of sensibility which her lover might perhaps, without her guidance, have misunderstood and laughed at, she had always been swift to distinguish from among the rest of Saint-Loup’s friends, the one who had a real affection for him, and to make that one her favourite. She knew how to make him feel grateful to such a friend, shew his gratitude, notice what things gave his friend pleasure and what pain. And presently Saint-Loup, without any more need of her to prompt him, began to think of all these things by himself, and at Balbec, where she was not with him, for me whom she had never seen, whom he had perhaps not yet so much as mentioned in his letters to her, of his own accord would pull up the window of a carriage in which I was sitting, take out of the room the flowers that made me feel unwell, and when he had to say good-bye to several people at once manage to do so before it was actually time for him to go, so as to be left alone and last with me, to make that distinction between them and me, to treat me differently from the rest. His mistress had opened his mind to the invisible, had brought a serious element into his life, delicacy into his heart, but all this escaped his sorrowing family who repeated: “That creature will be the death of him; meanwhile she’s doing what she can to disgrace him.” It is true that he had succeeded in getting out of her all the good that she was capable of doing him; and that she now caused him only incessant suffering, for she had taken an intense dislike to him and tormented him in every possible way. She had begun, one fine day, to look upon him as stupid and absurd because the friends that she had among the younger writers and actors had assured her that he was, and she duly repeated what they had said with that passion, that want of reserve which we shew whenever we receive from without and adopt as our own opinions or customs of which we previously knew nothing. She readily professed, like her actor friends, that between Saint-Loup and herself there was a great gulf fixed, and not to be crossed, because they were of different races, because she was an intellectual and he, whatever he might pretend, the born enemy of the intellect. This view of him seemed to her profound, and she sought confirmation of it in the most insignificant words, the most trivial actions of her lover. But when the same friends had further convinced her that she was destroying, in company so ill-suited to her, the great hopes which she had, they said, aroused in them, that her lover would leave a mark on her, that by living with him she was spoiling her future as an artist; to her contempt for Saint-Loup was added the same hatred that she would have felt for him if he had insisted upon inoculating her with a deadly germ. She saw him as seldom as possible, at the same time postponing the hour of a definite rupture, which seemed to me a highly improbable event. Saint-Loup made such sacrifices for her that unless she was ravishingly beautiful (but he had always refused to shew me her photograph, saying: “For one thing, she’s not a beauty, and besides she always takes badly. These are only some snapshots that I took myself with my kodak; they would give you a wrong idea of her.”) it would surely be difficult for her to find another man who would consent to anything of the sort. I never reflected that a certain obsession to make a name for oneself, even when one has no talent, that the admiration, no more than the privately expressed admiration of people who are imposing on one, can (although it may not perhaps have been the case with Saint-Loup’s mistress) be, even for a little prostitute, motives more determining than the pleasure of making money. Saint-Loup who, without quite understanding what was going on in the mind of his mistress, did not believe her to be completely sincere either in her unfair reproaches or in her promises of undying love, had all the same at certain moments the feeling that she would break with him whenever she could, and accordingly, impelled no doubt by the instinct of self-preservation which was part of his love, a love more clear-sighted, possibly, than Saint-Loup himself, making use, too, of a practical capacity for business which was compatible in him with the loftiest and blindest flights of the heart, had refused to settle upon her any capital, had borrowed an enormous sum so that she should want nothing, but made it over to her only from day to day. And no doubt, assuming that she really thought of leaving him, she was calmly waiting until she had feathered her nest, a process which, with the money given her by Saint-Loup, would not perhaps take very long, but would all the same require a time which must be conceded to prolong the happiness of my new friend — or his misery

   This dramatic period of their connexion, which had now reached its most acute stage, the most cruel for Saint-Loup, for she had forbidden him to remain in Paris, where his presence exasperated her, and had forced him to spend his leave at Balbec, within easy reach of his regiment — had begun one evening at the house of one of Saint-Loup’s aunts, on whom he had prevailed to allow his friend to come there, before a large party, to recite some of the speeches from a symbolical play in which she had once appeared in an ‘advanced’ theatre, and for which she had made him share the admiration that she herself professed

   But when she appeared in the room, with a large lily in her hand, and wearing a costume copied from the Ancilla Domini, which she had persuaded Saint-Loup was an absolute ‘vision of beauty,’ her entrance had been greeted, in that assemblage of clubmen and duchesses, with smiles which the monotonous tone of her chantings, the oddity of certain words and their frequent recurrence had changed into fits of laughter, stifled at first but presently so uncontrollable that the wretched reciter had been unable to go on. Next day Saint-Loup’s aunt had been universally censured for having allowed so grotesque an actress to appear in her drawing-room. A well-known duke made no bones about telling her that she had only herself to blame if she found herself criticised. “Damn it all, people really don’t come to see ‘turns’ like that! If the woman had talent, even; but she has none and never will have any. ‘Pon my soul, Paris is not such a fool as people make out. Society does not consist exclusively of imbeciles. This little lady evidently believed that she was going to take Paris by surprise. But Paris is not so easily surprised as all that, and there are still some things that they can’t make us swallow.”

   As for the actress, she left the house with Saint-Loup, exclaiming: “What do you mean by letting me in for those geese, those uneducated bitches, those dirty corner-boys? I don’t mind telling you, there wasn’t a man in the room who didn’t make eyes at me or squeeze my foot, and it was because I wouldn’t look at them that they were out for revenge.”

   Words which had changed Robert’s antipathy for people in society into a horror that was at once deep and distressing, and was provoked in him most of all by those who least deserved it, devoted kinsmen who, on behalf of the family, had sought to persuade Saint-Loup’s lady to break with him, a move which she represented to him as inspired by their passion for her. Robert, although he had at once ceased to see them, used to imagine when he was parted from his mistress as he was now, that they or others like them were profiting by his absence to return to the charge and had possibly prevailed over her. And when he spoke of the sensualists who were disloyal to their friends, who sought to seduce their friends’ wives, tried to make them come to houses of assignation, his whole face would glow with suffering and hatred

    “I would kill them with less compunction than I would kill a dog, which is at least a well-behaved beast, and loyal and faithful. There are men who deserve the guillotine if you like, far more than poor wretches who have been led into crime by poverty and by the cruelty of the rich.”

   He spent the greater part of his time in sending letters and telegrams to his mistress. Every time that, while still preventing him from returning to Paris, she found an excuse to quarrel with him by post, I read the news at once in his evident discomposure. Inasmuch as his mistress never told him what fault she found with him, suspecting that possibly if she did not tell him it was because she did not know herself, and simply had had enough of him, he would still have liked an explanation and used to write to her: “Tell me what I have done wrong. I am quite ready to acknowledge my faults,” the grief that overpowered him having the effect of persuading him that he had behaved badly

   But she kept him waiting indefinitely for her answers which, when they did come, were meaningless. And so it was almost always with a furrowed brow, and often with empty hands that I would see Saint-Loup returning from the post office, where, alone in all the hotel, he and Françoise went to fetch or to hand in letters, he from a lover’s impatience, she with a servant’s mistrust of others. (His telegrams obliged him to take a much longer journey.)

   When, some days after our dinner with the Blochs, my grandmother told me with a joyful air that Saint-Loup had just been asking her whether, before he left Balbec, she would not like him to take a photograph of her, and when I saw that she had put on her nicest dress on purpose, and was hesitating between several of her best hats, I felt a little annoyed by this childishness, which surprised me coming from her. I even went the length of asking myself whether I had not been mistaken in my grandmother, whether I did not esteem her too highly, whether she was as unconcerned as I had always supposed in the adornment of her person, whether she had not indeed the very weakness that I believed most alien to her temperament, namely coquetry

   Unfortunately, this displeasure that I derived from the prospect of a photographic ‘sitting,’ and more particularly from the satisfaction with which my grandmother appeared to be looking forward to it, I made so apparent that Françoise remarked it and did her best, unintentionally, to increase it by making me a sentimental, gushing speech, by which I refused to appear moved

    “Oh, Master; my poor Madame will be so pleased at having her likeness taken, she is going to wear the hat that her old Françoise has trimmed for her, you must allow her, Master.”

   I acquired the conviction that I was not cruel in laughing at Françoise’s sensibility, by reminding myself that my mother and grandmother, my models in all things, often did the same. But my grandmother, noticing that I seemed cross, said that if this plan of her sitting for her photograph offended me in any way she would give it up. I would not let her; I assured her that I saw no harm in it, and left her to adorn herself, but, thinking that I shewed my penetration and strength of mind, I added a few stinging words of sarcasm, intended to neutralize the pleasure which she seemed to find in being photographed, so that if I was obliged to see my grandmother’s magnificent hat, I succeeded at least in driving from her face that joyful expression which ought to have made me glad; but alas, it too often happens, while the people we love best are still alive, that such expressions appear to us as the exasperating manifestation of some unworthy freak of fancy rather than as the precious form of the happiness which we should dearly like to procure for them. My ill-humour arose more particularly from the fact that, during the last week, my grandmother had appeared to be avoiding me, and I had not been able to have her to myself for a moment, either by night or day. When I came back in the afternoon to be alone with her for a little I was told that she was not in the hotel; or else she would shut herself up with Françoise for endless confabulations which I was not permitted to interrupt. And when, after being out all evening with Saint-Loup, I had been thinking on the way home of the moment at which I should be able to go to my grandmother and to kiss her, in vain might I wait for her to knock on the partition between us the three little taps which would tell me to go in and say good night to her; I heard nothing; at length I would go to bed, a little resentful of her for depriving me, with an indifference so new and strange in her, of a joy on which I had so much counted, I would lie still for a while, my heart throbbing as in my childhood, listening to the wall which remained silent, until I cried myself to sleep",Marcel Proust,1986,"[91, 75, 63, 54, 54, 58, 63, 73]",8

393,The Men All Pause,"[Spoken Intro]
I know I was looking good
I had my Kenneth Cole shoes on
My Gianni Versace blue leather suit
My nails were done and my hair was fierce
And I was riding in a Cooper's limousine
Don't you want to ride?

[Verse 1]
I was at home, feeling sleazy
So I went down to the speakeasy
As soon as my feet hit the door
I had all attention from the dance floor

[Chorus]
Don't you know the men all pause?
When I walk into the room, the men all pause
The men all pause when I walk into the room
The men all pause, and the brides held their grooms
And they all sang the same old tune
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
Staring faces starting to get tired
I wanted to get out and go for a ride
Maybe this boredom created my hunger
So I said, ""Pull over at the local Fatburger""
I tried to walk in shy, very unnoticed
But the men turned away from their burgers and sodas
The focus was on me, I guess admiring good taste
I tried to play it off, but assurance was all over my face

[Chorus]
Don't you know the men all pause?
When I walk into the room, the men all pause
The men all pause when I walk into the room
The men all pause, and the brides held their grooms
And they all sang the same old tune
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

The men all pause when I hit the door
Attention came from the dance floor

And I just look too good for these people

394,I Found Someone,"[Verse 1]
I picked up the phone
She said hey it's me
I know it feels like forever
Since I've heard your voice
But I guess that's how it had to be
So we talked awhile
Still, she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know

[Chorus]
I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

[Verse 2]
Well I wasn't surprised
Still, it hit me kind of hard
It's hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart
I said I'm happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since you've been gone
I've done some praying
Some searching for myself

[Chorus]
And I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

[Bridge]
But it took tears and time down on my knees
And it's not who you'd ever guess
Or who I dreamed it'd be
But in the mirror one morning looking back at me

[Chorus]
I found someone
Just happened out of the blue
And it took everything I had
It took me losing you
But you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
Looking for my place under the sun

Strangers in my head keep making me forget
Where I came from, where I came from
There’s madness in our eyes, we're too blind to realize
Just what we’ve done, just what we’ve done

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it taking a hold
I feel a rush in my bones to you
I think we’re caught in a fight
Can we make it alright
With all these shadows on our backs?
How can we take it back? And

[Chorus]
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
Is this enough or are we just burning
Ashes to dust like a funeral pyre?
Can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?

[Verse 2]
Alone between the sheets, down on these dirty streets
I lost my soul, I lost my soul
Such a losing game again, between angels and demons
And I feel cold, I feel cold

[Pre-Chorus]
I think we’re caught in a fight
Can we make it alright
With all these shadows on our backs?
How can we take it back?

[Chorus]
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
Is this enough or are we just burning
Ashes to dust like a funeral pyre?
Can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
Is this enough or can we go higher?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
Is this enough or are we just burning
Ashes to dust like a funeral pyre?
Can we love with our hearts on fire?

[Outro]
How can we talk and the words just won't come out?

396,In My Dreams,"[Verse 1]
The lights are bright tonight, the music loud
A perfect mess that's what surrounds me
Then I see you over there, I can't seem to break the stare
Maybe it's 'cause your shirt is my favorite color
Then you walk on over with a smolder
And you hand me your number, I say, ""What is this?""
You say, ""Love at first sight, it exists""
But I've had my heart broken so many times before
Yeah, I've walked through so many empty doors

[Chorus]
But if I see you in my dreams tonight
Then maybe you were right
And I'll call you in the morning
If I see you in my dreams tonight
And you take my hands and tell me
""I've been waiting for you""
Then I'll tell you, ""Me too""
If I see you in my dreams tonight

[Verse 2]
I start to drive away and smile like I'm insane
How can I feel this way? I don't even know your name
The napkin doesn't say
Then I remember that I vowed not let anyone enter my heart
I say ""What is this?""
I know love at first sight can't exist

[Chorus]
But if I see you in my dreams tonight
Then maybe you were right
And I'll call you in the morning
If I see you in my dreams tonight
And you take my hands and tell me
""I've been waiting for you""
Then I'll tell you, ""Me too""
If I see you in my dreams tonight

[Bridge]
Maybe we'll meet in a different dimension
And you can tell me all the things you didn't mention
Maybe we'll meet in a different dimension
And you can tell me all the things you didn't mention
You'll say ""What is this?""
I'll say ""I guess love at first sight exists""

[Chorus]
Cause I saw you in my dreams that night
And I knew that you were right
So I called you in the morning
(In the morning, in the morning)

You want this? Then come on

Ooh, you did it all again, you broke another skin
Its hard to believe this time, hard to believe
That my heart, my heart's an open door
You got all you came for, baby

So weary
Someone to love is bigger than your pride's worth
It's bigger than the pain you got for it hurts
And out runs all of the sadness
It's terrifying, life, through the darkness

And I'd do it all again, I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again, I'd do it all again
You try sometimes but it won't stop
You got my heart and my heads lost, ooh

399,Burning Heart,"[Verse 1]
Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

[Chorus]
In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

[Verse 2]
In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

[Chorus] (x3)
In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst

In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

400,Shelter Me,"Everybody needs a little place they can hide
Somewhere to call their own
Don't let nobody inside
Every now and then we all need to let go
For some it's a doctor, for me it's rock and roll
For some it's a bottle
For some it's a pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's givin' them a thrill
Others point their finger if they don't like what they see
If you live in a glass house don't be throwing rocks at me

(Chorus)
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper to get us by
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper ohhh and it'll be alright

Check out Mr. Politician in his suit and tie
But when the doors are closed there ain't nothing he won't try
Meanwhile Mr. Medicine's treating his best friend's wife
Tipper led the war against the record industry
She said she saw the devil on her MTV
To look into the cabinet it takes more than a key
Just like Jimmy's skeleton's and his ministry

(Chorus)
For some it's a needle for some it's pill
Some people read the Bible cause it's giving them a thrill
You can spend your money before you get your pay
With a toss of the dice you can piss it all away

I miss you, I miss you

Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stare I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

And at least 15 people I've never met
You're talking politics and it's my weakness
To watch you do what you're doin' best

And sometimes I feel like I haunt you
From the other side of the room
And sometimes I feel like you want to
Call me up when you're feeling blue

So you twist my arm
When you let me go
You twist my arm
When you're feeling alone

And you don't need me like I'm needing you to
And the tone you take leaves me black and so blue
You twist my arm
So I can't let go

You started out like a whisper
Now you're a song I can't get out of my head
And if I knew how much you missed her
I could be someone else's ghost instead

From the other side of the room
And sometimes I feel like you want to

When you're feeling alone

I'm just drunk on the side of the road in a ditch
When you find me – I wanna go home, but I'm sick
There's more whiskey than blood in my veins
More tar than air in my lungs; the strung out call I make
Burned down on the edge of the highway
""I'm sorry for asking, but please, come take me home""

I quit talking again but I know you're still listening
To see if I sleep or I pierce my skin
Needles to the worn-out rags
The folds in my arms, the sickening black
And I haven't been taking my meds
Lock all the cabinets and send me to bed
'Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared
'Cause I'm alone again and I don't like the things I see

And I haven't been taking my meds
So lock all the cabinets, and send me to bed
'Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared again
And make my insides clean with your kitchen bleach
But I've kissed enough bathroom sinks
To make up for the lovers that never loved me

413,My Hometown,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick
And steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say ""Son, take a good look around
This is your hometown.""

This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown

In '65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights 'tween the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night
In the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed, then a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come to my hometown

To my hometown
To my hometown
To my hometown

Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says ""These jobs are going, boys
And they ain't coming back
To your hometown.""

To your hometown
To your hometown
To your hometown

Last night me and Kate, we laid in bed
Talking about getting out
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
I'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel, and said
""Son take a good look around
This is your hometown.""

Shout out to old Jews and old rules

This ain't no snap back, a nigga been trill
By the way, fuck your mag
You ain't gotta count it my nigga I can add
1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 20 million

And you can't keep a secret from the ground beneath you
Step very lightly on the earth below
Or before you know it, everyone will know
Streets were paved with a thousand eyes
And try as you may, you can't disguise
There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

Think when you speak, 'cause you gotta 'long the street
They can read what you say, so you gotta stay away
From words that sting, words are not true
And the things you say make a fool of you
Little white lies make the sidewalk cry
And you can betray with the things you say
Words won't last when you say 'em too fast
And you've been misled by the things you've said

Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

When you're living on the street
Life can be full of misery
Find a place to call your own
Make your heart into a home
You can do it, uh huh
You can do it, uh huh
You can do it, uh huh
You can do it, uh huh
You can do it

After every word there's a place that heard
Every time your shoe hits the avenue
And when you've gone they'll sing a song
Of the stories you told when you felt so bold
You better think twice when you cross the ice
Everything you do comes back to you
When you're shedding a tear, sidewalks will hear
When your laughter's true they'll run with you

Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

When you're living on the street
Life can be full of misery
Find a place to call your own
Make your heart into a home

I'm not here to feather his ruffle
I just came here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle

[Mike Richardson]
I'm L.A. Mike, and I play it cool
They don't sneak by me cause I'm no fool
I fly on the field and get on down
Everybody knows I don't mess around
I can break 'em, shake 'em
Any time of day
I like to steal it and make 'em pay
So please don't try to beat my hustle
Cause I'm just here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle

The sackman's comin', I'm your man Dent
If the quarterback's slow

Your Super Bowl plans
But don't get ready or go to any trouble
Unless you practice

It's Gary here, and I'm Mr.Clean
They call me ""hit man""
Don't know what they mean
They throw it long and watch me run
I'm on my man, one-on-one
Buddy's guys cover it down to the bone
That's why they call us the 46 zone
Come on everybody let's scream and yell
We're goin' to do the Shuffle
Then ring your bell

[William “Refrigerator” Perry]
You're lookin' at the Fridge
I'm the rookie
I may be large, but I'm no dumb cookie
You've seen me hit, you've seen me run

Made available in stores for sure

In my head, like a sandman I'm already rich
But um — The lines are thick so girls take a pick
""So how it standing Boo?"" — Come take a sip
Yeah take a sip, got lots to go round
What we headed to? You know we Telly-bound
I'mma put it in you so you like it
Then I'm gone, like the wind
Don't be mad girl, I got other friends
""Will I call you boo?"" That depends
If I remember or forget how the night ends

425,Small Town,"[Intro]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna waste my time with girls who rolling they eyelids
Girls who lookin' for a place to stay
Because they came away from Long Island
I don't wanna make your mind up
I'm just tryna make you mine quick
But ever since I put you in my line-up
All I do is choke: Heimlich
Good girl in a bad dress
But ain't nothing really changed but your address
You in the Upper West Side
You were thinking other people
Would've never accepted all your assets?
But I'm Cashis and you cash poor
I'mma give you anything that you ask for
You a small town girl but you living in the city
So you always keep your heart near your passport

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

[Verse 2]
I don't know what's next for us
But every time I talk it's like I messed it up
People wanna tell me that I'm too honest
Walking on eggshells, two omelettes
And I know it's hard cause you left your town
Dad don't call like he let you down
You don't wanna talk when the sun is out
But if we get a little drunk, then it's all allowed
And the truth comes down, it's pouring, pouring
'Bout to drop bombs like Warren, Moon
Color of your skin be orange, orange
Aren't you the girl that I met last June?
Who was so damn fun man, where did she go?
On vacation, Puerto Rico
Grand Theft Auto in your heart like Niko
Trying to meet your mother like I'm Jason Segel

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

[Bridge]
I can take you anywhere on a map
I can make it all good
You can make me come back
You keep movin', I can find you on the map
I can take you back home
You can make me unpack
You in Atlanta, but you from a small town
You in Chicago, but you from a small town
You move to LA, but you from a small town
You live in Brooklyn but I know you from a small town

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

[Outro]
Yeah, all across the globe
In every town you know
Yeah, you ain't foolin' us",Hoodie Allen,1986,"[84, 69, 59, 37, 25, 14, 6, 6, 6]",9
426,You're A Friend Of Mine,"Striking out?
Well, count me in
I'm gonna stand right by your side
Through thick or thin

Ain't no doubt
Gonna win
A walk through hell ain't bad
Compared to where we've been

(Oh, you can depend on me)
Over and over
Over and over
(Know that I intend to be)
The one who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die

Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine

That argument
I can't forget
We fought so hard
I don't think I've recovered yet

The girls we knew
Who thought you were cool
I never introduced
My favorite ones to you

(Oh, you can depend on me)
Over and over
Over and over
(Know that I intend to be)
I'm the one who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die

Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine

(Oh, you can depend on me)
Over and over
Over and over
(Know that I intend to be)
I'm the one who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die

Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine

You can depend on me
I'll be fine
Cause you're a friend of mine

Yeah, yeah
I'll be fine
Cause you're a friend of mine

Yeah, let me call for you one time

Ow!
Yeah",Clarence Clemons,1986,"[85, 62, 50, 39, 34, 24, 18, 22, 23]",9
427,Alive & Kicking,"[Verse One]
I was having a nice time out the night-time
You were digging a vice mine out of light lime
As if you had all the rights to make a sight
Locked in a gilded birdcage with a blurred name

[Chorus]
I could make my own wine
But I don't have time
Gentlemen are staring
I'm alive & kicking
Who knows what'll happen

[Verse Two]
Man & a woman in one & the auntie gone
I'm remarkable in long but I haven't shone
I see you have all the wrongs to sing this song
You're wanting me to chirrup with a big bong

[Chorus]
I could make my own wine
But I don't have time
Gentlemen are staring
I'm alive & kicking
Who knows what'll happen

[Post-Chorus]
Insanity, you can't sell humanity
This is madness, getting me filled with sadness
Anti-social, not particularly vocal
This is stupid, say, who wanted to do this?

[Chorus]
I could make my own wine
But I don't have time
Gentlemen are staring
I'm alive & kicking
Who knows what'll happen

[Post-Chorus]
Insanity, you can't sell humanity
This is madness, getting me filled with sadness
Anti-social, not particularly vocal
This is stupid, say, who wanted to do this?",Vimto(TaylorSwift14),1986,"[86, 59, 45, 32, 21, 12, 4, 4, 3]",9
428,Everybody Dance,"[Dope-ass bass intro]

[Chorus]
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

[Verse 1]
Music never lets you down
Puts a smile on your face any time, anyplace
Dancing helps relieve the pain
Soothes your mind, makes you happy again
Listen to those dancing feet
Close your eyes and let go
But it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Spinning all around the floor just like Rogers and Astaire
Who found love without a care stepping to our favorite tune
The good times always end too soon
Everybody's dancing lift your feet, have some fun
Come on everybody, get on your feet
Clap your hands everybody's screaming

[Chorus] (x2)

[Bass solo]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

There's nothing I wouldn't be

430,Strength,"[Куплет 1]
Мир существует так давно
А я любовь, что без ответа
Соединила континенты
Ей не нужны апплодисменты

[Припев]
Сила момента - сольешься с кем-то
И кто-то новый будет танцевать
Дышать, зачем-то быть реагентом
Мы лишь телами сможем передать
То, что смогли друг в друге отыскать

Обожать, раздражать, смотреть в глаза
Нарушать тишину, ты не права
Я не знаю, что сказать твои слова -
Я так слаба

[Куплет 2]
Мы все плоды беспечной страсти
И ты  рожден напоминать
Что люди упивались счастьем
Что им хотелось целовать

[Припев]
Сила момента - сольешься с кем-то
И кто-то новый будет танцевать
Дышать, зачем-то быть реагентом
Мы лишь телами сможем передать
То, что смогли друг в друге отыскать

Обожать, раздражать, смотреть в глаза
Нарушать тишину, ты не права
Я не знаю, что сказать твои слова -
Я так слаба",Сюзанна (Siuzanna),1986,"[99, 66, 61, 61, 66, 73, 85, 88, 91]",9

432,Separate Lives,"How long this time
Sand in the hourglass
Never aligned
You're my scratched up 45
There isn't an end to this
We haven't tried

Are we
Waiting on a turn in the tide
To realize
These separate lives
We're still here
Waiting on a turn in the tide
Just words with no rhyme
These separate lives

Time it rolls slowly
Keep moving on
We keep on
Time it rolls slowly
Keep moving on
We keep on
Time it rolls slowly
Keep moving on
We keep on
Time it rolls slowly
Keep moving on
We keep on

Stalling each turn
These shadows of change appear
As you return
Drifting two ways unknown
Heavy eyes on the road again

Hung on your dialling tone

Are we
Waiting on a turn in the tide
To realize
These separate lives
We're still here
Waiting on a turn in the tide
Just words with no rhyme
These separate lives

Time it rolls slowly
Keep moving on
We keep on
Time it rolls slowly
Keep moving on
We keep on
Time it rolls slowly
Keep moving on

433,Face The Face,"Face the face, got to face the face
Face the face, got to face the face

You must have heard the cautionary tales
The dangers hidden on the cul-de-sac trails
From wiser folk who have been through it all
And the faded names sprayed up on the wall

We've got to judge the judge
We've got to find the finds
We've got to scheme the schemes
We've got to line the lines
We must stake the stakes
We gotta show the shown
We gotta take the takes
We gotta know the known

(Try to place the place
Where we can face the face)
We got to face the face
(Try to place the place
Where we can face the face)

Face the face, got to face the face
Face the face, got to face the face

Got to
Got to

You must have tried and defied belief
Maybe buried your head in insular grief
I need your hunger, you need mine
A million mouths can swallow up time

We've got to fool the fools
We got to plan the plans
We got to rule the rules
We got to stand the stands
We got to fight the fight
We must fall the falls
We got to light the light
We got to call the calls

(We must race the race
So we can face the face)
We got to race the race
(We must race the race
So we can face the face)

Face the face, we got to face the face
We got to race the race
We got to

Keep looking

New York, Chicago
London and Glasgow
Keep looking

Keep on looking
Keep on cooking
Got to stay on this case
Study the pix
Watch the flix
We've got to find the face

Face the face, got to face the face (Watch the flix)
Got to

We've got to judge the judge
We got to find the finds
We've got to scheme the schemes
We got to line the lines

437,Perfect Way,"I took a backseat, a backhander, I took her back to her room
I better get back to the basics for you, oh yeah
You gotta conscience, compassion, you got a way with the word
You gotta heart full of complacency too

I don't have a purpose or mission, I'm empty by definition
I got a lack girl that you'd love to be
You wanna diva a deduction, you wanna do what they do
Wanna do damage that you can undo

Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

I took a day job amendment, I took a liking to you
I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You wanna message a confession, you wanna martyr me too
You wanna margin of error for two

Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer, an exception, I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book but I knew

In times of tenderness in terms baby so true
Until such time as I can understand all the things you do

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

Want to forgive you for all the things that you do
Wanna forget how to remember with you
Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue

Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
This is a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
Is this a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

438,Never,"[Verse 1]
Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, ""Stop playin' it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control""

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Bridge]
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head

[Chorus]
I'm sayin' it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (You're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same (I'll never be the...)
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe

439,It's Only Love,"[Verse 1]
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you",The Beatles,1986,"[100, 71, 50, 26, 18, 15, 16, 19]",8
440,Broken Wings,"[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'

[Verse 1]
I got broken wings, but I'm still flyin'
With a loss of faith, and I'm still tryin'
Got stereotype, radios turn me down
Cause I won't turn up on the mic
I'd rather rap about my life
And give advice to someone
Who's about to give up on life
That's real, and fuck how you feel
Independent, cause I don't need a deal
Picked up the mic and I put down the pills
Picked up the vibes
They don't care how you feel
Remember my Grandpa passed away
And it killed, my Dad
I saw life isn't promised, so i made a promise
That I'll pursuit my dreams
No matter how they feel
They said that I can't
Took out the T into a T
I killed it
Made sacrifices, always workin' O.T
When they call in, I will fill in
All eyes on me when
I decide to step in the buildin'
Fuck that radio music you listen to
I spit that real shit
In high school I was unpopular
Never fit in with the cool kids
They were busy partyin'
And makin' a bunch of excuses
I sat home, buildin' my craft
I had a dream, I'm pursuin'
It's hard to have these hopes and dreams
Especially when I got

[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'

[Verse 2]
You don't have to relate to me
You don't have to have hate for me
You don't have words to say to me
You don't even have to pray for me
Do you
Cause I'll do me
Until the day that I'm through
'Remember back then
Back-stabbin' friends told me to not to
'Remember they said that if you need me then I got you
When I needed you most, you were a ghost
And you left me feelin' empty
And then I lost hope
You want me to fight, how can I cope
Slowly realizing my friends come and go
Findin' myself at the end of the road
I'm dyin' inside but live like I won't
The time is getting closer
And those beneath me are getting farther
Everyday I'm growin' older
I see that I'm not a part of society
They're eyeing me
Dyin' for me to fall apart
Cause I have a chance and they missed theirs
Cause I'm workin' harder
I was apart of the kids at school
Askin' why don't they like us
It's like we don't exist
We're there, but they do not mind us
I'm a little mental
It's okay to dream while you are mind fucked
Spreadin' both of my wings
I wanna fly but

[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'

441,Sex As A Weapon,"[Produced by Frank Dukes and BADBADNOTGOOD]

[Lucy Liu]
Men, they have always held the power
But power is a fickle mistress
The nature of power is that it belongs to no one
Until it is taken, seized, seized through sex, violence, gold

[Talib Kweli]
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Uh, they say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot, meet your death in less than uh
Sex is a weapon, so when I shoot, meet your death in less than a second
Sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
I’m a sex shooter, I take aim and let it go
A dictator, the best ruler you’ ever know
So dominant that I promise to shake your confidence
I’ll sponsor you with scholarships, school you or got a doctorate
Assimilation, a necessity is the mother of invention
But lust is the father of innovation
Uh, they got together and raised a nation
Birth of civilization, first it hurt, then it was amazing

[Res - Hook]
Packing heat and taking aim
Ain’t no need, you know you gon’ get your way
Popping shit and spitting game
But there’s no need, you know you gon’ get your way

[Talib Kweli]
Submission is the mission when building and destroying
My methods they quite suggest that when I’m employing the quotas and joy
You can’t avoid this joyous, I’m such a …
The moisture that you deploying is taking us on voyage
I’m trying to find the spot, but you’re wetter than a tsunami
Shaping her like she paper, twistin’ like origami
Organically grown, never give orgasms to organisms with X chromosomes
Taking her home, good thing about her
She don’t know her power to eat a clam like it’s chowder
I’m bombing her lotus flower
She can’t fake it cause I know the face
She on top, because she know her place
See, your place ain’t the same as your position
Why you racing? It ain’t a competition
‘Cause you already been declared the winner
Now get up and prepare my dinner!

[Hook]

[Res]
Why you playing me like I'm a toy, oh daddy
You’ twistin’ my mind
But I’m a woman, and if there’s anything I know
I know sex is a weaṗon
And it can hurt you to the strongest degree
Deep down, you never forget her
You can have anything you want
Ain’t gotta get all like that boy
You can have it if you want it

442,Just Another Day,"[Produced by Dr. Dre & Ron ""Neff-U"" Feemster]

[Intro]
It's motherfuckin' Game time!

[Verse: Game]
Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
That's how you remember it? That's how I remember it
Yeah, dip into the liquor store, nine in my khakis
Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me; been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas when enemy, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama, she'll tell you how a Blood taste
Basket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left
Run up in Beats, ""Bitch pass the safe! Compton""
Produced by a billion in this motherfucker
Still smokin', Dre we need a ceilin' in this motherfucker
Compton! They killin' in this motherfucker
They grillin' in this motherfucker
Lock the door, they stealin' in this motherfucker
No chains, no rings, this my home
Nigga, this Hub City, no-fly zone
Niggas pull out burners
Start breakin' like Turbo on Ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean, where the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on that concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumpin' Mobb Deep
'Cause I mob deep down that side street
'Cause I'm a West side rider, live with gats on collars
Don't hate me, better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leanin' on that Brougham
Flamed up like a Coke can with my name on it

[Outro: Asia Bryant]
Another day in Compton, the thrill is high
Know somebody's watchin', but I don't know why
Feel the fire burnin', it touches the sky
Feel 'em coming at you, I won't die tonight
So I get by, I get by
I get by, I get, I get by
'Cause it's just another day in Compton",The Game,1986,"[86, 85, 88, 90]",4
443,Own The Night,"[Intro: Tilian]
Forget my jealousy
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said, ""We own the night!""

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can’t think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it’s admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Let your hair down, have one more round, drink 'til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes, baby, this is living
Roller coaster, up and down in random motion
Oh, come in closer, ditch your problems, better days are coming

Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment and live now, live now
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment, feel it now

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can’t think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it’s admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall
You’ll forget I’m wrong

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Call your phone and open up my fate
'Cause I know you're so connected
I need poison, mitigate my pain
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Give me false hope in my veins
Tranquilize and modify my brain

[Bridge: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do, the thrill is gone
(Wake up, you're dead, you're gonna go)
So I play these nervous songs
Pretend that I’m not barely hanging on
(Wake up, you're dead, you're gonna go)

And medicate, medicate
Medicate me all night long
Medicate, medicate
Medicate me all night long
(You're dead, you're dead, you're dead now)

444,Go,"[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,1986,"[97, 70, 47, 46, 46, 48, 53]",7
445,In Between Days,"[Verse 1]
Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry
Go on, go on
Just walk away
Go on, go on
Your choice is made
Go on, go on
And disappear
Go on, go on
Away from here

[Chorus]
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
Inbetween without you
Without you

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
Come back come back
Don't walk away
Come back, come back
Come back today
Come back, come back
Why can't you see
Come back, come back
Come back to me

[Chorus]
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me
And be her in between
Without you
Without you

Without you
Without you

Without you
Without you

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold, oh
And we just lost the beat
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us

How do you love someone, that's hurt so bad?
Even 911, ain't got a thing, to help them
How do you mend a wound that cuts straight through their heart?
And you can see everything that's left, just ain't enough

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we did some damage (I know)
Nobody else understands it (No, no)
Well baby, here's my shoulder you can lean on

Whenever you need a friend, yeah (No, no)
I wait on standby and I won't ever leave

In case of emergency
Emergency, emergency
In case of emergency

How do you love someone who sees the past?
But can't seem to change or keep repeating mistakes from wayback
How do you love someone, who sees the bad in everything?
Drinking from a half-empty glass, thinking suicidal
Only ones we hurt are ourselves and I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we did some damage (I know)
Nobody else understands it (No, no)
Well baby, here's my shoulder you can lean on

Emergency, emergency
I'll be right there, in case of emergency

Layin' on the couch with some oxys and a fat bitch
You thinkin' she bad, but to me she kinda average (Yeah, yeah)
All these rappers lame as fuck, all your hoes been acting up
I'm choppin' up some product for your bitch, you bet I serve a cut

[Verse 2]
Don't get it confused, pop the fuse then it's time to dip
Allah Akbar, jihad when I hit a lick
Been a fiend since birth
Beer goggles, views from the 5th
Choppers rain heavy down in Mexico, let it rip
Stick shift swerving, I'm way even out in ATL
They callin' me the G.O.A.T., all I know is how to give 'em hell
Shake been doing well, can't you tell how I play with words?
Now you mad as fuck 'cause the dragon came and pulled your girl
I ain't just a dragon, call me Moses how I water whip
Rap made me a monster, I'm a product so I gotta flip
All these loose lips sink ships but they sucking dick
Ain't no problem with 'em long as I don't get a fucking jit

[Chorus]
Two Perkys and a Xan, that's a sleepin' bag
I got two bad bitches in my sleepin' bag

Boy, don't test your luck, turn the venue to a boxing match

454,Prove Me Wrong,"[Intro]
Calm before the storm

[Verse 1]
From whence I came, express my pain
Shape and mold my frame, I go by the name of O.C
My PKA when onstage plus in real life this here’s my government title
Idle to many, not the truth to naysayers
Been an avenue walker since British walkers
Way before Obama was thought to be in office
Loss of friends to jail and some dead in a coffin
Way of life and music has since gone corporate
Picture the days past now it’s a whole different portrait
Me dumbin’ down would be a sign of weakness
Throwin’ in the towel as Victor Ortiz did
Protect yourselves at all times my guard’s up
Keepin’ the odds even with the flow and the bars up
The Star Child leave ‘em star-struck
Knowin’ an engine won’t run on its own without spark plugs

[Hook]
If you could read my thoughts what you’d discover is mind-blowing
Even when I’m asleep, my mind going
My subconscious stay alert
Revealing the questions to answers
Otherwise that don’t know
What be the norm for others, for me, move in slow-mo'
See deception and truth be told
Yeah, set in my ways ‘till you prove me wrong

[Verse 2]
Uh, Sub-par ain’t part of my rapport
The blood gods are fiendin’ for a taste of my allure
For O.C. addicts, sorry for the wait
Tie off your arms, here’s another dose, a few years withdrawal
Been a bit too long, I know
Vent, talk shit, let it out, exhale
Time to let it go
From a league of extraordinary men
So what’s expected is nothing below perfection
Never lost that connection
When in doubt, life’s about chances
Wilted trees only grow new branches
Words paint a canvas within, around my questions and answers
Mistake of a panther, lurkin’, I know the game’s hurtin’
One thing’s for certain
When it’s all said and done, who supplies the best service?
Take a look around, who’s well-worth the purchase
Y’all fooled by these aliens
Phenom is an earthling

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, there’s nothing but wealth in my soul
So the slogan, “Men lie, numbers don’t”
Read between the quotes or cop-out
In the D gettin’ songs knocked out
Soon to hit the road and rock out
In pre-recordin’ I can fix my mistakes
But it’s another level in the flesh live, onstage
Big acts backed by majors
Sign the dotted line, 360 like they doin’ us a favor
Fake-ass bosses talkin’ balderdash with fake designer garments
Glass in they crosses, balloonin’ they profits
You niggas need stop it
How far do the lies go before you expose
Seems pussy ain’t a man’s down-fall no mo’
New things, stretch a lie as far is it could go
Product placement, live shit is way down in the basement
Crime, tour, promote murder, catch a case, heh

455,To Live And Die In L.A.,"[Intro]
“Street Science, you’re on the air. What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac’s new one?”
“I love 2Pac’s new record.”
“Right, but don’t you feel like that creates tension between East and West? I mean, he’s talking about killing people, ‘I had sex with your wife’ — and not in those words. But he’s talking about, ‘I wanna see you deceased’…""

[Intro: 2Pac]
No Doubt
To live and die in L.A., California
What you say about Los Angeles?
Still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
Who was a friend, now a ghost in the dark
Cold-hearted 'bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the scene
What's the worst they can do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
My angel sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
It's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear, the pen right across from hell
I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down
Get us pissed, to live and die in L.A

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angels sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, brown pride, and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mothafucka burned out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tray, Heron, Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angel sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
Let my angel sing

[Outro: 2Pac]
This go out for 92.3 and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin' my shit
Makin' my shit sells quatruple quitraple platinum

All the real motherfuckers

Sometimes building ivory towers
Sometimes knocking castles down
Sometimes building you a stairway
Lock you underground

One of the living - and if you can't stick together
Well
You're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight ?
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
Well
You're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight ?
Shoot bullets of fire
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together

462,You Belong To The City,"[Verse 1]
The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it
Starting all over again
The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat
The traffic roars
The sirens scream
You look at the faces
It's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

[Chorus]
Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

[Verse 2]
When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you've done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed
You still don't know
Where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

[Chorus]
Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

[Bridge:]
You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
Cause you can take it

(Alternate Chorus)
You belong to the city
You belong to the night

463,Lay Your Hands On Me,"[Chorus]
Lay your hands on me
While I'm bleeding dry
Break on through blue skies
I'll take you higher

Caught up in circles
All dreams and bright lights
Wait, I'm here always
Brighter than sunshine
I fly
Fly out
Fly out
To your heart
Fly out
Fly out

[Chorus]
Lay your hands on me
Stay close by my side
Drive me so crazy
Moonlight and star shine

[Verse 2]
Faded into the setting sun
I'll see you again I'll carry on
Feeling like I'm floating leaves in the fleeting sky
You can sing that song
Let it go
Move on
Let's go
Way out
Spaced out
Spaced out

Lay your hands on me
Stay close to my eyes
Drive me so crazy

Wrap her up, she is all I need

That behind every - ""great man""
There had to be a - ""great woman""

That it's no longer true
So we're coming out of the kitchen
Cause there's something we forgot to say to you (we say)

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too
Woman to woman
We're singing with you
The ""inferior sex"" got a new exterior
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too
Everybody - take a look around
Can you see - can you see - can you see
There's a woman right next to you

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Now we ain't making stories
And we ain't laying plans
Cause a man still loves a woman
And a woman still loves a man
(Just the same though)

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells

There'll be girls across the nation that'll eat this up
Babe, I know that it's your soul, but could you bottle it up?
Get down to the heart of it, know it's my heart
You're shit out of your luck, don't make me tell you again, again, again

[Chorus: P-Holla & Sara Bareilles]
Woo!
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love
Ayy, ayy, I do it for love
Uh-huh, yeah
What'cha do it for? What'cha do it for?
What'cha, what'cha do it for?

[Verse 1: P-Holla]
I do it for the love, yes I do
So you don't care about the money? Well, yes, it's true
And I'm so blessed to be fulfilling my destiny
All material things could mean less to me
Only thing I ever could need is a Sara B sample with a dope ass beat
And get the mic check (Check) are the levels right?
And if it's good then I'll be here for several nights
'Cause the only thing I need is a strong supporting team
The most important thing that helps supporting my dream
And I can't forget my family, helpin' keep my sanity
No matter what I do I know they'll always stand for me

Chorus: P-Holla & Sara Bareilles
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love
I do it for love, I do it for love
No matter what I do, I know I'll always do it for love

What'cha do it for? What'cha do it for?
I'll do it for love

[Verse 2: P-Holla]
'Cause I can only do me that's all I know
Dodge the difficulties and take life slow
And if I ever slow up you know I'll always show up
It's still the same old me even-even if I blow up
Love is what I do it for, love is why I'm rapping
Love is the main reason for how all of this happened
Love for all my fans love for all the shows
Got love for all my memories no matter where I go
Even if I 'mount to nothin', I know there's always something
It's not a fitness test but it'll always keep me running
One good thing 'bout music: when it hits you feel no pain
So I keep it close to me make sure it never goes away
Uh, from the start I knew it in my heart
If I made one person happy then I know I did my part
Now if I stay into it and people dig the music
I put on for my cities and know I'll always do it for love

[Chorus: P-Holla & Sara Bareilles]
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love
I do it for love, I do it for love
Yeah, put on for my cities, I know I'll always do it for love

I'll do it for love

I want a girl worth fightin' for

473,I Knew The Bride (When She Use To Rock And Roll),"I want a hero: an uncommon want,
When every year and month sends forth a new one,
Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,
The age discovers he is not the true one;
Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
I'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan—
We all have seen him, in the pantomime,
Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.

Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,
Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,
And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow :
France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier
Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.

Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,
Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,
Were French, and famous people, as we know:
And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,
With many of the military set,
Exceedingly remarkable at times,
But not at all adapted to my rhymes.

Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,
And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;
Because the army 's grown more popular,
At which the naval people are concern'd;
Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,
Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.

Brave men were living before Agamemnon
And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
But then they shone not on the poet's page,
And so have been forgotten:—I condemn none,
But can't find any in the present age
Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.

Most epic poets plunge 'in medias res'
(Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
What went before—by way of episode,
While seated after dinner at his ease,
Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

That is the usual method, but not mine—
My way is to begin with the beginning;
The regularity of my design
Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
And therefore I shall open with a line
(Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)
Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.

In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
Famous for oranges and women—he
Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
So says the proverb—and I quite agree;
Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
Cadiz perhaps—but that you soon may see;
Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.

His father's name was Jose—Don, of course,—
A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
Than Jose, who begot our hero, who
Begot—but that 's to come—Well, to renew:

His mother was a learned lady, famed
For every branch of every science known
In every Christian language ever named,
With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,
She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
And even the good with inward envy groan,
Finding themselves so very much exceeded
In their own way by all the things that she did.

Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
All Calderon and greater part of Lope,
So that if any actor miss'd his part
She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
For her Feinagle's were an useless art,
And he himself obliged to shut up shop—he
Could never make a memory so fine as
That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.

Her favourite science was the mathematical,
Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
A prodigy—her morning dress was dimity,
Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.

She knew the Latin—that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
And Greek—the alphabet—I 'm nearly sure;
She read some French romances here and there,
Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
For native Spanish she had no great care,
At least her conversation was obscure;
Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.

She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
And said there was analogy between 'em;
She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;
But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong
And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,
''T is strange—the Hebrew noun which means ""I am,""
The English always use to govern d--n.'

Some women use their tongues—she look'd a lecture,
Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
An all-in-all sufficient self-director,
Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,
The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
Whose suicide was almost an anomaly—
One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'
(The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').

In short, she was a walking calculation,
Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,
Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,
Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,
Morality's prim personification,
In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;
To others' share let 'female errors fall,'
For she had not even one—the worst of all.

O! she was perfect past all parallel—
Of any modern female saint's comparison;
So far above the cunning powers of hell,
Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
Even her minutest motions went as well
As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!

Perfect she was, but as perfection is
Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss
Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss
(I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
Went plucking various fruit without her leave.

He was a mortal of the careless kind,
With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,
Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;
The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,
Whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two—
But for domestic quarrels one will do.

Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
A great opinion of her own good qualities;
Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
But then she had a devil of a spirit,
And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
And let few opportunities escape
Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.

This was an easy matter with a man
Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
And even the wisest, do the best they can,
Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'
And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
And why and wherefore no one understands.

'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
With persons of no sort of education,
Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
Grow tired of scientific conversation:
I don't choose to say much upon this head,
I'm a plain man, and in a single station,
But—Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?

Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd—why,
Not any of the many could divine,
Though several thousand people chose to try,
'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
I loathe that low vice—curiosity;
But if there 's anything in which I shine,
'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
Not having of my own domestic cares.

And so I interfered, and with the best
Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
I think the foolish people were possess'd,
For neither of them could I ever find,
Although their porter afterwards confess'd—
But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,
For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,
A pail of housemaid's water unawares.

A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;
Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth
To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,
To teach him manners for the time to come.

Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
For some time an unhappy sort of life,
Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
They lived respectably as man and wife,
Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,
And put the business past all kind of doubt.

For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,
And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
But as he had some lucid intermissions,
She next decided he was only bad;
Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,
No sort of explanation could be had,
Save that her duty both to man and God
Required this conduct—which seem'd very odd.

She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,
All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
And then she had all Seville for abettors,
Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
The hearers of her case became repeaters,
Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
Some for amusement, others for old grudges.

And then this best and weakest woman bore
With such serenity her husband's woes,
Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose
Never to say a word about them more—
Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'

No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
Is philosophic in our former friends;
'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
The more so in obtaining our own ends;
And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
Conduct like this by no means comprehends;
Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,
But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.

And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
And help them with a lie or two additional,
I 'm not to blame, as you well know—no more is
Any one else—they were become traditional;
Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
And science profits by this resurrection—
Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.

Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
Then their relations, who made matters worse.
('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
To whom it may be best to have recourse—
I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
But scarce a fee was paid on either side
Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.

He died: and most unluckily, because,
According to all hints I could collect
From counsel learned in those kinds of laws
(Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),
His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
A thousand pities also with respect
To public feeling, which on this occasion
Was manifested in a great sensation.

But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay
The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
His house was sold, his servants sent away,
A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
A priest the other—at least so they say:
I ask'd the doctors after his disease—
He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
And left his widow to her own aversion.

Yet Jose was an honourable man,
That I must say who knew him very well;
Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
Indeed there were not many more to tell;
And if his passions now and then outran
Discretion, and were not so peaceable
As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.

Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,
Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
Let 's own—since it can do no good on earth—
It was a trying moment that which found him
Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:
No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
Save death or Doctors' Commons—so he died.

Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,
Which, with a long minority and care,
Promised to turn out well in proper hands:
Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
And answer'd but to nature's just demands;
An only son left with an only mother
Is brought up much more wisely than another.

Sagest of women, even of widows, she
Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
And worthy of the noblest pedigree
(His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):
Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
In case our lord the king should go to war again,
He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
And how to scale a fortress—or a nunnery.

But that which Donna Inez most desired,
And saw into herself each day before all
The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;
Much into all his studies she inquired,
And so they were submitted first to her, all,
Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery
To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.

The languages, especially the dead,
The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
The arts, at least all such as could be said
To be the most remote from common use,
In all these he was much and deeply read;
But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
Or hints continuation of the species,
Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.

His classic studies made a little puzzle,
Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
And for their Aeneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
Were forced to make an odd sort of apology,
For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.

Ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,
Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'

Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,
For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
Although no doubt his real intent was good,
For speaking out so plainly in his song,
So much indeed as to be downright rude;
And then what proper person can be partial
To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?

Juan was taught from out the best edition,
Expurgated by learned men, who place
Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
Too much their modest bard by this omission,
And pitying sore his mutilated case,
They only add them all in an appendix,
Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;

For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'
Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;
They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
To call them back into their separate cages,
Instead of standing staring all together,
Like garden gods—and not so decent either.

The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
Was ornamented in a sort of way
Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
Is more than I know—But Don Juan's mother
Kept this herself, and gave her son another.

Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
He did not take such studies for restraints;
But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
So well not one of the aforesaid paints
As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
Which make the reader envy his transgressions.

This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan—
I can't but say that his mamma was right,
If such an education was the true one.
She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
She did this during even her husband's life—
I recommend as much to every wife.

Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;
At six a charming child, and at eleven
With all the promise of as fine a face
As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:
He studied steadily, and grew apace,
And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
For half his days were pass'd at church, the other
Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.

At six, I said, he was a charming child,
At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;
Although in infancy a little wild,
They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy
Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
Her young philosopher was grown already.

I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
But what I say is neither here nor there:
I knew his father well, and have some skill
In character—but it would not be fair
From sire to son to augur good or ill:
He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair—
But scandal 's my aversion—I protest
Against all evil speaking, even in jest.

For my part I say nothing—nothing—but
This I will say—my reasons are my own—
That if I had an only son to put
To school (as God be praised that I have none),
'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
Him up to learn his catechism alone,
No—no—I 'd send him out betimes to college,
For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.

For there one learns—'t is not for me to boast,
Though I acquired—but I pass over that,
As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
I say that there 's the place—but 'Verbum sat.'
I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,
Knowledge of matters—but no matter what—
I never married—but, I think, I know
That sons should not be educated so.

Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd
Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
And everybody but his mother deem'd
Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)
If any said so, for to be precocious
Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.

Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
Selected for discretion and devotion,
There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
Of many charms in her as natural
As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,
Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
(But this last simile is trite and stupid).

The darkness of her Oriental eye
Accorded with her Moorish origin
(Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;
In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);
When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,
Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.

She married (I forget the pedigree)
With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
His blood less noble than such blood should be;
At such alliances his sires would frown,
In that point so precise in each degree
That they bred in and in, as might be shown,
Marrying their cousins—nay, their aunts, and nieces,
Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.

This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;
For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,
'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.

However this might be, the race went on
Improving still through every generation,
Until it centred in an only son,
Who left an only daughter; my narration
May have suggested that this single one
Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
I shall have much to speak about), and she
Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.

Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
And love than either; and there would arise
A something in them which was not desire,
But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.

Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
Her stature tall—I hate a dumpy woman.

Wedded she was some years, and to a man
Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
Especially in countries near the sun:
And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.

'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
And all the fault of that indecent sun,
Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
That howsoever people fast and pray,
The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.

Happy the nations of the moral North!
Where all is virtue, and the winter season
Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on
The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
Because it is a marketable vice.

Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
A man well looking for his years, and who
Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:
They lived together, as most people do,
Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
And not exactly either one or two;
Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.

Julia was—yet I never could see why—
With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:
Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,
For malice still imputes some private end,
That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;

And that still keeping up the old connection,
Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,
She took his lady also in affection,
And certainly this course was much the best:
She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,
And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
At least she left it a more slender handle.

I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
With other people's eyes, or if her own
Discoveries made, but none could be aware
Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
Indifferent from the first or callous grown:
I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,
She kept her counsel in so close a way.

Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
Caress'd him often—such a thing might be
Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
But I am not so sure I should have smiled
When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
These few short years make wondrous alterations,
Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.

Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
And much embarrassment in either eye;
There surely will be little doubt with some
That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
But as for Juan, he had no more notion
Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.

Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
And tremulously gentle her small hand
Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art
Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.

And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
For that compression in its burning core;
Even innocence itself has many a wile,
And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.

But passion most dissembles, yet betrays
Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays
Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
And in whatever aspect it arrays
Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,
Are masks it often wears, and still too late.

Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
All these are little preludes to possession,
Of which young passion cannot be bereft,
And merely tend to show how greatly love is
Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.

Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
She felt it going, and resolved to make
The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;
Her resolutions were most truly great,
And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
As being the best judge of a lady's case.

She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
And next day paid a visit to his mother,
And look'd extremely at the opening door,
Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
Grateful she was, and yet a little sore—
Again it opens, it can be no other,
'T is surely Juan now—No! I 'm afraid
That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.

She now determined that a virtuous woman
Should rather face and overcome temptation,
That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
That is to say, a thought beyond the common
Preference, that we must feel upon occasion
For people who are pleasanter than others,
But then they only seem so many brothers.

And even if by chance—and who can tell?
The devil 's so very sly—she should discover
That all within was not so very well,
And, if still free, that such or such a lover
Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
I recommend young ladies to make trial.

And then there are such things as love divine,
Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
Such as the angels think so very fine,
And matrons who would be no less secure,
Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'
Thus Julia said—and thought so, to be sure;
And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
On whom her reveries celestial ran.

Such love is innocent, and may exist
Between young persons without any danger.
A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
But not my fault—I tell them all in time.

Love, then, but love within its proper limits,
Was Julia's innocent determination
In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
Exertion might be useful on occasion;
And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
He might be taught, by love and her together—
I really don't know what, nor Julia either.

Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
In mail of proof—her purity of soul—
She, for the future of her strength convinced.
And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
With any kind of troublesome control;
But whether Julia to the task was equal
Is that which must be mention'd in the sequel.

Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,
Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable—
A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
That all the Apostles would have done as they did.

And if in the mean time her husband died,
But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
Never could she survive that common loss;
But just suppose that moment should betide,
I only say suppose it—inter nos.
(This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)

I only say suppose this supposition:
Juan being then grown up to man's estate
Would fully suit a widow of condition,
Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
The mischief, after all, could not be great,
For he would learn the rudiments of love,
I mean the seraph way of those above.

So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
Poor little fellow! he had no idea
Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,
He puzzled over what he found a new one,
But not as yet imagined it could be
Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.

Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
His home deserted for the lonely wood,
Tormented with a wound he could not know,
His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,
But then, I beg it may be understood,
By solitude I mean a sultan's, not
A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.

'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
Where transport and security entwine,
Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
With the exception of the second line,
For that same twining 'transport and security'
Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.

The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
To the good sense and senses of mankind,
The very thing which every body feels,
As all have found on trial, or may find,
That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals
Or love.—I won't say more about 'entwined'
Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,
But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.

Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,
Thinking unutterable things; he threw
Himself at length within the leafy nooks
Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
There poets find materials for their books,
And every now and then we read them through,
So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.

He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
His self-communion with his own high soul,
Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
Had mitigated part, though not the whole
Of its disease; he did the best he could
With things not very subject to control,
And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.

He thought about himself, and the whole earth
Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
And how the deuce they ever could have birth;
And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
How many miles the moon might have in girth,
Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;—
And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.

In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern
Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
Which some are born with, but the most part learn
To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
His brain about the action of the sky;
If you think 't was philosophy that this did,
I can't help thinking puberty assisted.

He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
And how the goddesses came down to men:
He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
And when he look'd upon his watch again,
He found how much old Time had been a winner—
He also found that he had lost his dinner.

Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,
Boscan, or Garcilasso;—by the wind
Even as the page is rustled while we look,
So by the poesy of his own mind
Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,
As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
According to some good old woman's tale.

Thus would he while his lonely hours away
Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
With—several other things, which I forget,
Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.

Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
Her only son with question or surmise:
Whether it was she did not see, or would not,
Or, like all very clever people, could not.

This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
For instance—gentlemen, whose ladies take
Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,
And break the—Which commandment is 't they break?
(I have forgot the number, and think no man
Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.

A real husband always is suspicious,
But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
The last indeed 's infallibly the case:
And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.

Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;
Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
Till some confounded escapade has blighted
The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
And then the mother cries, the father swears,
And wonders why the devil he got heirs.

But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
She had some other motive much more near
For leaving Juan to this new temptation;
But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
In case he thought his wife too great a prize.

It was upon a day, a summer's day.—
Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
And so is spring about the end of May;
The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
That there are months which nature grows more merry in,—
March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.

'T was on a summer's day—the sixth of June:—
I like to be particular in dates,
Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
Change horses, making history change its tune,
Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
Excepting the post-obits of theology.

'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
Of half-past six—perhaps still nearer seven—
When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
With all the trophies of triumphant song—
He won them well, and may he wear them long!

She sate, but not alone; I know not well
How this same interview had taken place,
And even if I knew, I should not tell—
People should hold their tongues in any case;
No matter how or why the thing befell,
But there were she and Juan, face to face—
When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
But very difficult, to shut their eyes.

How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart
Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.
O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,
How self-deceitful is the sagest part
Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along—
The precipice she stood on was immense,
So was her creed in her own innocence.

She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
And of the folly of all prudish fears,
Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,
And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,
Because that number rarely much endears,
And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.

When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'
They mean to scold, and very often do;
When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.

Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,
For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
By all the vows below to powers above,
She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
Quite by mistake—she thought it was her own;

Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,
Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:
And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
To leave together this imprudent pair,
She who for many years had watch'd her son so—
I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.

The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,
As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'
Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp
His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:
She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.

I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
But what he did, is much what you would do;
His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,—
Love is so very timid when 't is new:
She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,
And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.

The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they
Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
Sees half the business in a wicked way
On which three single hours of moonshine smile—
And then she looks so modest all the while.

There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
To open all itself, without the power
Of calling wholly back its self-control;
The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
A loving languor, which is not repose.

And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
And half retiring from the glowing arm,
Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
But then the situation had its charm,
And then—God knows what next—I can't go on;
I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.

O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
With your confounded fantasies, to more
Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
Your system feigns o'er the controulless core
Of human hearts, than all the long array
Of poets and romancers:—You 're a bore,
A charlatan, a coxcomb—and have been,
At best, no better than a go-between.

And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
Until too late for useful conversation;
The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;
A little still she strove, and much repented
And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'—consented.

'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward
To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,
And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
I care not for new pleasures, as the old
Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.

O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,
Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:
I make a resolution every spring
Of reformation, ere the year run out,
But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:
I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.

Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take—
Start not! still chaster reader—she 'll be nice hence—
Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
This liberty is a poetic licence,
Which some irregularity may make
In the design, and as I have a high sense
Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit
To beg his pardon when I err a bit.

This licence is to hope the reader will
Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
Without whose epoch my poetic skill
For want of facts would all be thrown away),
But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say
'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure
About the day—the era 's more obscure.

We 'll talk of that anon.—'T is sweet to hear
At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;
'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;
'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,
Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum
Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
The lisp of children, and their earliest words.

Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,
Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
From civic revelry to rural mirth;
Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
Sweet is revenge—especially to women,
Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.

Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
The unexpected death of some old lady
Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
Who 've made 'us youth' wait too—too long already
For an estate, or cash, or country seat,
Still breaking, but with stamina so steady
That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.

'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,
Particularly with a tiresome friend:
Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
Dear is the helpless creature we defend
Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.

But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
Is first and passionate love—it stands alone,
Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd—all 's known—
And life yields nothing further to recall
Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,
No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.

Man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use
Of his own nature, and the various arts,
And likes particularly to produce
Some new experiment to show his parts;
This is the age of oddities let loose,
Where different talents find their different marts;
You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your
Labour, there 's a sure market for imposture.

What opposite discoveries we have seen!
(Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
One makes new noses, one a guillotine,
One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
But vaccination certainly has been
A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
By borrowing a new one from an ox.

Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
But has not answer'd like the apparatus
Of the Humane Society's beginning
By which men are unsuffocated gratis:
What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.

'T is said the great came from America;
Perhaps it may set out on its return,—
The population there so spreads, they say
'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
With war, or plague, or famine, any way,
So that civilisation they may learn;
And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is—
Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?

This is the patent-age of new inventions
For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
All propagated with the best intentions;
Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals
Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

Man 's a phenomenon, one knows not what,
And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;
Few mortals know what end they would be at,
But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,
The path is through perplexing ways, and when
The goal is gain'd, we die, you know—and then—

What then?—I do not know, no more do you—
And so good night.—Return we to our story:
'T was in November, when fine days are few,
And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;
And the sea dashes round the promontory,
And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
And sober suns must set at five o'clock.

'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:
I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.

'T was midnight—Donna Julia was in bed,
Sleeping, most probably,—when at her door
Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
If they had never been awoke before,
And that they have been so we all have read,
And are to be so, at the least, once more.--
The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
First knocks were heard, then 'Madam—Madam—hist!

'For God's sake, Madam—Madam—here 's my master,
With more than half the city at his back—
Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!
'T is not my fault—I kept good watch—Alack!
Do pray undo the bolt a little faster—
They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack
Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly—
Surely the window 's not so very high!'

By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
The major part of them had long been wived,
And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
Of any wicked woman, who contrived
By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
Examples of this kind are so contagious,
Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.

I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
But for a cavalier of his condition
It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
Without a word of previous admonition,
To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.

Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep
(Mind—that I do not say—she had not slept),
Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
As if she had just now from out them crept:
I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.

But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who
Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,
And therefore side by side were gently laid,
Until the hours of absence should run through,
And truant husband should return, and say,
'My dear, I was the first who came away.'

Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
Has madness seized you? would that I had died
Ere such a monster's victim I had been!
What may this midnight violence betide,
A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
Search, then, the room!'—Alfonso said, 'I will.'

He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,
Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,
And found much linen, lace, and several pair
Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
With other articles of ladies fair,
To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,
And wounded several shutters, and some boards.

Under the bed they search'd, and there they found—
No matter what—it was not that they sought;
They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
And then they stared each other's faces round:
'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
Of looking in the bed as well as under.

During this inquisition, Julia's tongue
Was not asleep—'Yes, search and search,' she cried,
'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
It was for this that I became a bride!
For this in silence I have suffer'd long
A husband like Alfonso at my side;
But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.

'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
If ever you indeed deserved the name,
Is 't worthy of your years?—you have threescore—
Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same—
Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,
How dare you think your lady would go on so?

'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold
The common privileges of my sex?
That I have chosen a confessor so old
And deaf, that any other it would vex,
And never once he has had cause to scold,
But found my very innocence perplex
So much, he always doubted I was married—
How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!

'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
I favor'd none—nay, was almost uncivil?
Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,
Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?

'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani
Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
Were there not also Russians, English, many?
The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.

'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,
The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?
And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
Me also, since the time so opportune is—
O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,
Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?

'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.
Under pretence of business indispensable
With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he
Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
And not from any love to you nor me.

'If he comes here to take a deposition,
By all means let the gentleman proceed;
You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:
There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need—
Let every thing be noted with precision,
I would not you for nothing should be fee'd—
But, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'
'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'

'There is the closet, there the toilet, there
The antechamber—search them under, over;
There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
The chimney—which would really hold a lover.
I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
And make no further noise, till you discover
The secret cavern of this lurking treasure—
And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.

'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown
Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
Pray have the courtesy to make it known
Who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal
Him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown—
I hope he 's young and handsome—is he tall?
Tell me—and be assured, that since you stain
My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.

'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
Or for so young a husband's jealous fears
(Antonia! let me have a glass of water).
I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
My mother dream'd not in my natal hour
That I should fall into a monster's power.

'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
You saw that she was sleeping by my side
When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
Look where you please—we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,
Or for the sake of decency abide
A moment at the door, that we may be
Drest to receive so much good company.

'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
The little I have said may serve to show
The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
I leave you to your conscience as before,
'T will one day ask you why you used me so?
God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-
Antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'

She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale
She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
Its snow through all;—her soft lips lie apart,
And louder than her breathing beats her heart.

The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,
And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
Knowing they must be settled by the laws.

With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
Following Antonia's motions here and there,
With much suspicion in his attitude;
For reputations he had little care;
So that a suit or action were made good,
Small pity had he for the young and fair,
And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
Were proved by competent false witnesses.

But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
When, after searching in five hundred nooks,
And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
Added to those his lady with such vigour
Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,
Quick, thick, and heavy—as a thunder-shower.

At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,
And indications of hysterics, whose
Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
And then he tried to muster all his patience.

He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
But sage Antonia cut him short before
The anvil of his speech received the hammer,
With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
Or madam dies.'—Alfonso mutter'd, 'D—n her,'
But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.

With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
The attorney last, who linger'd near the door
Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
Antonia let him—not a little sore
At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'
In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
The door was fasten'd in his legal face.

No sooner was it bolted, than—Oh shame!
O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!
How can you do such things and keep your fame,
Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!
But to proceed—for there is more behind:
With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.

He had been hid—I don't pretend to say
How, nor can I indeed describe the where—
Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,
No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
But pity him I neither must nor may
His suffocation by that pretty pair;
'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.

And, secondly, I pity not, because
He had no business to commit a sin,
Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,
At least 't was rather early to begin;
But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
So much as when we call our old debts in
At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
And find a deuced balance with the devil.

Of his position I can give no notion:
'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
And that the medicine answer'd very well;
Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
For David lived, but Juan nearly died.

What 's to be done? Alfonso will be back
The moment he has sent his fools away.
Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
But no device could be brought into play—
And how to parry the renew'd attack?
Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.

He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;
Even then their love they could not all command,
And half forgot their danger and despair:
Antonia's patience now was at a stand—
'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'
She whisper'd, in great wrath—'I must deposit
This pretty gentleman within the closet:

'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night—
Who can have put my master in this mood?
What will become on 't—I 'm in such a fright,
The devil 's in the urchin, and no good—
Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.

'Had it but been for a stout cavalier
Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)—
But for a child, what piece of work is here!
I really, madam, wonder at your taste
(Come, sir, get in)—my master must be near:
There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
And if we can but till the morning keep
Our counsel—(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'

Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
However, present remedy was none,
And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:
Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,
She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.

Alfonso paused a minute—then begun
Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
He would not justify what he had done,
To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;
But there were ample reasons for it, none
Of which he specified in this his pleading:
His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'

Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
A ready answer, which at once enables
A matron, who her husband's foible knows,
By a few timely words to turn the tables,
Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,—
Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.

Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,—
Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,
But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds—
But that can't be, as has been often shown,
A lady with apologies abounds;—
It might be that her silence sprang alone
From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.

There might be one more motive, which makes two;
Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,—
Mention'd his jealousy but never who
Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
Conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,
His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
To speak of Inez now were, one may say,
Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.

A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
Silence is best, besides there is a tact
(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
But it will serve to keep my verse compact)—
Which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,
A lady always distant from the fact:
The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
There 's nothing so becoming to the face.

They blush, and we believe them; at least I
Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
In any case, attempting a reply,
For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
A tear or two, and then we make it up;
And then—and then—and then—sit down and sup.

Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,
Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
Denying several little things he wanted:
He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,
Beseeching she no further would refuse,
When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.

A pair of shoes!—what then? not much, if they
Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
Was but a moment's act.—Ah! well-a-day!
My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze—
Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
And then flew out into another passion.

He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
And Julia instant to the closet flew.
'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake—not a word—
The door is open—you may yet slip through
The passage you so often have explored—
Here is the garden-key—Fly—fly—Adieu!
Haste—haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet—
Day has not broke—there 's no one in the street:

None can say that this was not good advice,
The only mischief was, it came too late;
Of all experience 't is the usual price,
A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,
And might have done so by the garden-gate,
But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
Who threaten'd death—so Juan knock'd him down.

Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'
But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.
Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,
Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.

Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,
And they continued battling hand to hand,
For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
His temper not being under great command,
If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
Alfonso's days had not been in the land
Much longer.—Think of husbands', lovers' lives!
And how ye may be doubly widows—wives!

Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
And Juan throttled him to get away,
And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
And then his only garment quite gave way;
He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.

Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
An awkward spectacle their eyes before;
Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,
Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,
Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,
And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.

Here ends this canto.—Need I sing, or say,
How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,
Who favours what she should not, found his way,
And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?
The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
Were in the English newspapers, of course.

If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
The depositions, and the cause at full,
The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,
There 's more than one edition, and the readings
Are various, but they none of them are dull;
The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,
Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.

But Donna Inez, to divert the train
Of one of the most circulating scandals
That had for centuries been known in Spain,
At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)
To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.

She had resolved that he should travel through
All European climes, by land or sea,
To mend his former morals, and get new,
Especially in France and Italy
(At least this is the thing most people do).
Julia was sent into a convent: she
Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
Shown in the following copy of her Letter:—

'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
'T is wise—'t is well, but not the less a pain;
I have no further claim on your young heart,
Mine is the victim, and would be again;
To love too much has been the only art
I used;—I write in haste, and if a stain
Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.

'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
So dear is still the memory of that dream;
Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest—
I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.

'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
'T is woman's whole existence; man may range
The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;
Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange
Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,
And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
Men have all these resources, we but one,
To love again, and be again undone.

'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
For me on earth, except some years to hide
My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;
These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
The passion which still rages as before—
And so farewell—forgive me, love me—No,
That word is idle now—but let it go.

'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;
But still I think I can collect my mind;
My blood still rushes where my spirit 's set,
As roll the waves before the settled wind;
My heart is feminine, nor can forget—
To all, except one image, madly blind;
So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.

'I have no more to say, but linger still,
And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
My misery can scarce be more complete:
I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
And I must even survive this last adieu,
And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'

This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:
Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
It trembled as magnetic needles do,
And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'
The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.

This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
I shall proceed with his adventures is
Dependent on the public altogether;
We 'll see, however, what they say to this:
Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;
And if their approbation we experience,
Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.

My poem 's epic, and is meant to be
Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
New characters; the episodes are three:
A panoramic view of hell 's in training,
After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.

All these things will be specified in time,
With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,
Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
I 've got new mythological machinery,
And very handsome supernatural scenery.

There 's only one slight difference between
Me and my epic brethren gone before,
And here the advantage is my own, I ween
(Not that I have not several merits more,
But this will more peculiarly be seen);
They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
Whereas this story 's actually true.

If any person doubt it, I appeal
To history, tradition, and to facts,
To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
All these confirm my statement a good deal,
But that which more completely faith exacts
Is that myself, and several now in Seville,
Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.

If ever I should condescend to prose,
I 'll write poetical commandments, which
Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
That went before; in these I shall enrich
My text with many things that no one knows,
And carry precept to the highest pitch:
I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,
Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'

Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:
With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
Commit—flirtation with the muse of Moore.

Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;
Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'
(There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);
Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
This is true criticism, and you may kiss—
Exactly as you please, or not,—the rod;

If any person should presume to assert
This story is not moral, first, I pray,
That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,
Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
(But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
The very place where wicked people go.

If, after all, there should be some so blind
To their own good this warning to despise,
Led by some tortuosity of mind,
Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'
I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
They also lie too—under a mistake.

The public approbation I expect,
And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,
Which I with their amusement will connect
(So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect
My epical pretensions to the laurel:
For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
I 've bribed my grandmother's review—the British.

I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
Who thank'd me duly by return of post—
I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;
Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
And break a promise after having made it her,
Denying the receipt of what it cost,
And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
All I can say is—that he had the money.

I think that with this holy new alliance
I may ensure the public, and defy
All other magazines of art or science,
Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,
Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.

'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so
Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
Hint that some six or seven good years ago
(Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
I was most ready to return a blow,
And would not brook at all this sort of thing
In my hot youth—when George the Third was King.

But now at thirty years my hair is grey
(I wonder what it will be like at forty?
I thought of a peruke the other day)—
My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I
Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.

No more—no more—Oh! never more on me
The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
Which out of all the lovely things we see
Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
To double even the sweetness of a flower.

No more—no more—Oh! never more, my heart,
Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art
Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,
Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.

My days of love are over; me no more
The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
Can make the fool of which they made before,—
In short, I must not lead the life I did do;
The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
The copious use of claret is forbid too,
So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
I think I must take up with avarice.

Ambition was my idol, which was broken
Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
And the two last have left me many a token
O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,
'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'—a chymic treasure
Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes—
My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.

What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
A certain portion of uncertain paper:
Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;
For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'
To have, when the original is dust,
A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.

What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King
Cheops erected the first pyramid
And largest, thinking it was just the thing
To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
But somebody or other rummaging,
Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.

But I being fond of true philosophy,
Say very often to myself, 'Alas!
All things that have been born were born to die,
And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
And if you had it o'er again—'t would pass—
So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'

But for the present, gentle reader! and
Still gentler purchaser! the bard—that 's I—
Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'
We meet again, if we should understand
Each other; and if not, I shall not try
Your patience further than by this short sample—
'T were well if others follow'd my example.

'Go, little book, from this my solitude!
I cast thee on the waters—go thy ways!
And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
The world will find thee after many days.'
When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
I can't help putting in my claim to praise—
The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:
For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.",Lord Byron,1986,"[98, 94, 77, 81]",4

476,Morning Desire,"[Verse 1]
Here it is seven in the a.m
It's gonna take more than wakin' to rise me
I wake up with this need again
But feel the love of the woman beside me
It's just one of those days
When I wanna lay here with her
And love her before I leave
And listen to the rain fall up on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

[Chorus]
Oh I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

[Verse 2]
It looks like I'm gonna be late again
And I need to get up and get movin'
And I'm tryin'
But the longer I keep stalling
The more I think about callin' in and lying here
It's just one of those days
When I wanna stay here with her
And watch her while she sleeps
And listen to the rain fall up on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

[Chorus]
Oh I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

[Bridge]
Well I love to hear the rain fallin' on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

[Chorus]
Oh I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire

Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, ""Holler if ya need some dick""
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
""Hood dudes usually don't look like you""
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', ""Pimp Squad, hold it down!""
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am

Waitin' here to find the sign

491,Take On Me,"[Verse 1]
We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Verse 2]
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, things that you say
Is it a life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

[Outro]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day",​a-ha,1986,"[99, 97]",2

Girls are more fun
The party ain't begun
'Till all the girls come
Girls are more fun, mmm

Make you dance to the music
Have a good time, mmm
I could tell the way she moved, yeah
What was on her mind, mmm

She said the girls decide
If it's gonna be dead or alive
Bout choosing to arrive or not to show, mmm
Please understand, she took me by the hand
And pulled me closer than you wanna know
Then she whispered to me

Girls are more fun, ooh, ooh
Girls are more fun
The party ain't begun
'Till all the girls come
'Cause girls are more fun, ah, ooh

Good night turned to late night
We're still on the floor, uh
Drove my mind through the red light
Before she said, go, uh, well
(Baby let's go)

It was party time, her body close to mine
That familiar line, dancin' slow, ho
It was up and down, in, out, and all around
She never made a sound 'till she let go
It when somethin' like this, oh

Girls are more fun, ooh, ooh
You know the girls are more fun, mmm
The party ain't begun
'Till, uh, 'till everyone
Girls are more fun

You read it in the news
Every day they're findin'
Somethin' new, ho, oh

Girls are more fun, mmm
Girls are more fun

For those of you

Who've gone the other way
Girls are more fun, oh, yeah

The magic stare
Nothing can compare
Its the best feelin anywhere

Girls are more fun, ooh, ooh
Girls are more fun
The party ain't begun
'Till all the girls come
Cause girls are more fun

Everybody say, yeah
Girls are more fun, yeah

Girls are more fun
Girls are more fun

493,Fortress Around Your Heart,"[Verse 1]
Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls where I'd once laid
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

[Verse 2]
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop in my track for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the lands I'd known
I recognized the fields where I'd once played
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]",Sting,1986,[98],1
494,Lonely Ol' Night,"She calls me up and says baby it's a lonely ol' night
I don't know I'm just so scared and lonely all at the same time
Nobody told us it was gonna work out this way
No, no, no, no, no
I guess they knew we'd work it out in our own way

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

Radio playing softly some singer's sad sad song
He's singing about standing in the shadows of love
I guess he feels awfully alone
She says I know exactly what he means
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's a sad, sad, sad, sad feeling
When you're living on those in-betweens
But it's okay

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

She calls me Baby
She calls everybody Baby
It's a lonely ol' night but ain't they all

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you
Yeah, like me and you
Yeah, like me and you",John Mellencamp,1986,[100],1
