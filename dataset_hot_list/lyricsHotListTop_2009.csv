0,Empire State Of Mind,"[Intro: JAY-Z]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from…

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (ayy, aha) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle (yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (yeah) (okay)
Now you're in New York (aha, aha, aha) (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (new)
Big lights will inspire you (come on) (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (You're welcome, OG) (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh) (I made you hot, nigga)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip, though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rocks
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice Cee Lo, three card Monte
Labor Day Parade – rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo – I'm from the Empire State, that's…

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (ayy) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (That boy good) (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
(Welcome to the bright light, baby)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (ayy, ah) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say, ""Yeah"" (come on)
(Come on) Yeah (come on)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
In New York (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)

Wake up in the morning feelin' like P. Diddy (Hey, what up, girl?)

'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

4,Fireflies,"[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus (Extended)]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years

I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

She ain't got a man, but she's not alone

20,You Belong With Me,"[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your boyfriend, he's upset
He's going off about something that you said
Cause he doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of bands he doesn't like
And he'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He wears jerseys, I wear t-shirts
He's team captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Walking the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since he brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doin' with a dick like that?

I wear Toms and he wears sneakers
He's banging your friend underneath the bleachers

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night

I think I know it's with me

For the next four years in this town

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
Hey, you know, this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
Yeah, yeah

You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova

Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say

Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice

[Chorus]
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova

Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember

Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

On the table, screamin'
""Fuck the other side! They're jealous!""

It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels.""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels.""

34,Live Like We're Dying,"[Intro]
Ohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough?
Till it's to late, it's not too late

[Verse 2]
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying

[Verse 2]
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll no one on the line, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
Yeah, mmm

[Bridge]
You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?
You never know a good thing till it's gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying

35,Do I,"[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

Every time I turn the conversation
To something deeper than the weather
I can feel you always shutting down
And when I need an explanation for the silence
You just tell me you don't want to talk about it now
What you're not saying is coming in loud and clear
We're at a crossroads here

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

[Verse 2]
With you, I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowing where you're going
I start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye
How about a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

[Bridge]
Consider me a memory
Consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph
Someone who used to make you laugh

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

Take a breath, take it deep
""Calm yourself,"" he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, ""Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps""
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I’m wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won’t get the chance to say goodbye
But it’s too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test

So chicks can wiggle and shake
Cuz this image is fake

I’m trying hard to relate in a place filled with so much hate

Some brothers debate some love and some hate
Whatever the case its all about the choices you make
That’s the reason you balloon'll deflate

But if you only knew, we real people homie just like you

How many times I gotta hear some fanatic in my ear
Tellin me to keep it real when they ain’t payin my bills
Or feeding my kids, judging me on how I live
If my crib in the hood or if its up in the hills

[Verse 11: Marc 7even]
Have you forgotten who you are?
O you think you’re a star
Why you frontin’ (you ain’t nothing)
You went from nothing to something
But something means nothing

And you got money ain’t givin’ them nothing

Flossin and frontin

The image you save
Your brother thats one big parade

I’m sitting here spitting the phrase
The next time they smile and they wave
Will probably be with the gays

Nasty from the shoulders watch how I switch positions
Put him in a blender my heart been December
Put him in a spitter, can't be reassembled
I'm a real nigga, really made mistakes
Never ran away, I am not pretendin'
High school back when I was at McKinley
I still fuck with Scooby, shout out to lil Brittney
Stayed with black guys, niggas always pickin' on a bright nigga

Deal with it, Kevin stand up in they chest
This the same girl was pullin' out her breast
Got her mother lyin' tryna get a check

Diamonds in your mouth all around your neck

Praise you when you up, kick you when you fall
Throw you to the vultures, sniper pick you off
In a court of law brought you to the floor
All my young rappers they kept it one million
Learn from my misfortune don't get in your feelin's
Be an individual you go to prison

Soft and sweet with all the power of the earth behind
Broken fever and soaking sheets
Twisted round our bodies in the cool of the morning
Turning the cards over one by one
I see the faces staring back from across the ages
And everything tastes so strong, so strong
But you could never sense because
According to you
There isn't anything left to believe in
Because you never could see
That there is everything that we are receiving
We joined the battle between right and wrong
When we were all so young and certain
And now we pass the passions on
In the broken light streaming through the shredded curtain
They bring you scapegoats to sacrifice
Anything or anybody just to nail your pain to
They bring you promises you know are lies
So you feel betrayed in everything that you cling to so
According to you
There isn't anything left to believe in
Because you never could see
That there is everything that we are receiving
Come back to us all
Where there is everything that we are receiving",New Model Army,2009,"[55, 67]",2

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile

Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

Time is going by so much faster than I

So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know

If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall

Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Augh, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: ""Next time you blog, try to spit a flow.""
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spider-Man throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo-rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog

'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold

'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow

[Verse 2]
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
""Vietnam vet"", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho—yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair (Woops!)

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so hot
My motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie

They will not control us

My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Chorus]
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AHH!
AHH!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, ""What up, Yeezus?""
I said, ""Shit—I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions""
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god

69,You Can't Always Get What You Want,"[Intro: London Bach Choir]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man
No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime
You'll find
You get what you need

[Verse 1]
I saw her today at the reception

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you  might find
You get what you need

[Verse 2]
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, ""We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're going to blow a 50-amp fuse""
Sing it to me

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need

[Verse 3]
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was ""death""
I said to him:

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands

You can't always get what you want, ooh yeah
You can't always get what you want

70,This Is War,"[Verse 1: LilyPichu as Jinx]
Look into my eyes try to see what I know
A twisted little journey through the path of psycho
A vivid premonition manifesting undigesting
The petty little trifles taught to adolescents condescending
I'm digressing
A complicated girl with very simple wishes
A global rocket has your people sleeping with the fishes
And when your city comes to desolation
One small step and I reach global incineration
I'm not normal and I don't pretend so
My approach is pretty much a bomb crescendo
Reality is false and its so cause i say
Chaotic demolition well that's just my forte
Death is a fun way to pass the time though
Several little bullets moving in staccato
The terror of my reign will live on in infamy
Singing when they die like a dead man's symphony

[Verse 2: Badministrator as Twitch]
Yo it's the rat with the flat hat
I'm hip to you house cats
Can't fool me grab the cheese from the mouse trap
Feel a light breeze when i move past
Ease to your groups back
Pause have a laugh
Throw the venom cask
And shoot for the center of mass
Hit the expunge and I blow the stacks
You've been removed by the menace rat
It's Jerry with a Tommy gun
Scream for your mommy son (""MOMMY!!!""-Ziggs?)
Saw me in the lobby had your chance
Probably should have run
Sewer rat with Splinter Cell abilities
Shredder of your back line your team screaming turtle please
Strike from the shadows like a ninja on a murder spree
And if I'm feeling blue
What I do is put some shots through the purple team
Brain to your pinky
Can't see me but your lane's getting stinky
And now I see the wards if you pink me
The plague's back it's over
I'm killing lame soldiers
With spray and pray tactics
Like the Pope with a super soaker

[Verse 3: AntiRivet as Heimerdinger]
You are soooo poorly designed for this

In matters much delectable
My brain remains detectable
So very very confident
A battle is inevitable
This data is incredible
My findings unforgettable
Fluctuating patterns
Tell me something's in these parables
If matter doesn't matter
Then what side am I to choose?
This data doesn't tell me
Who will win and who will lose...

[Verse 4: Josef Falkensköld as Jayce]
Alright that's enough ugly people step aside
They call me hero defender and Piltover's Pride
I take it all in stride
Giving girls heart attacks
Strike you with the hammer
And then bring sexy back
You wanna try me in the lane?
I'll have you seeing stars
I'm dishing out the pain
Up close and from afar
Strong like a bull
Versatility stunning
Accelerating shock blasts
That hit you running and yet...
I'm pretty smart I'm a scientist you know
And when I calculate the likeliness of success for my foes
I get but one result
Failure forever
Look at Viktor's face it's so cute
Said no one ever

[Verse 5: Lunity as Caitlyn]
On patrol
Get set
Take aim
Lock and load
Now put your hands up
On your knees I'm in control
Don't try that shit with me
You're gonna get caught
I only got 2 words for you
Head Shot
Boom
That's it you're dead
You took the headstart
But could just as well have stayed and slit your throat instead
You wanna know why it's called ace in the hole?
I'm the ace and the hole is where you used to have your head
Got the heart of the dragon
And a mind like a genie
When you step into my town
You'll be answering to me, so...
I'm not gonna blame ya if you're petrified scared stiff
I am the law and no one shoots the sheriff

[Verse 6: AntiRivet as Singed]
It's nearly time
The battle's on
Oh friends off mine
I've seen poison fill the air
A war is raging with deadly flare
WAR
What a trivial thing
A night with battle just isn't my fling
But a curiosity dwells within
Who will lose
And who will win?

[Verse 7: Stephanos Rex as Viktor]
I am the inventor
A bold experimentor
Join as my acolyte and i will be your mentor
Science will destroy you it will build you anew
The gifts I offer now eternal power a new point of view
Steel will fix all your flaws
You will rise above human laws
You will mock them made of meat
They'll drop to worship at your feet
Forget now the shame of defeat
Our victory shall be so sweet
Replace all your petty emotions
Or keep your blood you'll bleed oceans
All you little fleshbags
Stuck with your old hags
Watch as their skin sags
They're fodder for my labs
Your bodies are so frail
We will be your final nail
This is the REVOLUTION
The glorious
EVOLUTION

[Verse 8: AntiRivet as Mundo]
MOVE
Mundo up to the plate
The doctor's arrived
Mundo sealing your fate(MUNDO)
Top Mundo's flow?
Who thinks they can match it?
No bad blood here Mundo buries the hatchet
Doom in degrees
Wrecking 3v3's
Life is affliction Mundo cure your disease
Mundo the King end of conversation
And this doctor's not strange to regeneration
Piltover punies
No match for cleaver
You see Mundo's face
Now you a believer
You lay on the ground
Broken to pieces
Going to HAM?
Mundo goes where he pleases

[Verse 9: Stephanos Rex as Ezreal]
I was born with sorcerous power in my veins
My gauntlet hits harder than Piltover's trains
You'll never strike back
I got jukes for days
When they find what's left
You'll still be ablaze
And yeah I rock the Haruhi dance so what?
You know it puts the ladies straight into rut
Have you seen the look on Lux's face?
Go on
Be jelly
You're such a disgrace
I'll kill for my princess
No robbers or fakes
Flee or I'll trash you 'til you've got the shakes
So you think you can take me?

Stay out of Vi's way (""Boom baby""-Vi)

Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up then I let myself down

Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?

Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Guess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's going to be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beating
Nobody's going to see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

[Verse 2]
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Chorus]
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

Well it might be me but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Oh
La, la, la, la, la
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
I know it might be crazy
But did you hear the story?
I think I heard it vaguely
A girl and a zombie
Oh, tell me more, boy
Yeah
Sounds like a fantasy
Oh, what could go so wrong
With a girl and a zombie
You're from the perfect paradise
And I'm living on the darker side
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me
Right from the start you caught my eye
And something inside me came to life
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Yeah, yeah
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday
We're gonna be someday

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Girl, you look delicious
Oh, I mean gorgeous
Well, now you're getting fearless
No, I'm just rooting for us
If different was a super power
We'd be so flawless
Yeah, we could make these two worlds ours
I'm rooting for us
Two lonely hearts meet in the dark
Imagine it now they start a spark
You got my attention
What happens next, then?
Movies and long walks in the park
Hanging out anywhere we want
I like the way you're thinking
I can almost see it

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side

If they laugh, we'll say
We're gonna be someday

75,Eight Second Ride,"[Verse 1 - Jake Owen]
I said, ""Hey girl, what's your name?
Haven't I seen you before?
I recognize them dark green eyes
When you do-si-doed across the floor""
""Are you alone, or are you with someone?""
She said, ""As a matter of fact I'm not""
So I took her hand, that's when it all began
And we headed towards the parking lot

[Chorus - Jake Owen]
And she said, ""Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I have not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high""
I said, ""Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride""

[Verse 2 -Jake Owen]
We went riding around rocking to the sound
Of ""A Country Boy Can Survive""
And I knew then she was my kindof a girl
Cause she was singing every single line
Then she slid on over put my hand on her shoulder
And I asked her what she wanted to do
She said, ""It really don't matter where we go
Just as long as I'm riding with you""

[Chorus-Jake Owen]
And she said, ""Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high""
I said, ""Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride""

[Bridge - Jake Owen]
So we headed out to Old Tobacco Road
Put the tailgate down and we made love
She said ""A true country boy is hard to find
But I found one wilder then any eight second ride""

[Chorus - Jake Owen]
And she said, ""Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high""
I said, ""Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride""

76,Bad Habits,"[Verse 1]
I don't know how deep to go
But I'ma let it all out so come peep the show
Got my first Xanny of my mate, I ain't gonna say his name
It was fun at the start, I used to treat it like a game
This around the time when The Nebulizer dropped
I was on all types of shit, but there’s one I couldn’t stop
And it played with my brain, but I focused on the music
I focused so much, didn't realize I abused it
Never had a plan to stop, not in that prediction
Going through fame, couldn’t see I had addictions
One turned to two, turned to three, turned to four
Then I need about six a day, a little bit more
Mixing it with lean, gotta stop people seeing
What damages can be by looking at me, shit
What to do cause I feel like a fool
And I hate any rapper making Xannies look cool
Shit was getting bad I was filled up with hateful
Thoughts in my mind, I would argue with April
Agreed I would stop, shit I'd give it a go
By the first fucking night, felt like slitting my throat
Second night, my body shaking
The ambulance appear and I'm thinking in my mind, what the fuck they doing here?
Suddenly I'm caught up and there's no time to muck round
Lucky I got here, cause my body 'bout to shut down

[Verse 2]
Back to square one, nah man you can't quit
You gotta wean yourself off, that's some hard shit
What the fuck man, my brain is a mess
I can't remember that much, feel the pain in my legs
I wish it was that easy, I could give up and go
And people still got the hide to tell me pick up my phone
Maybe that's my fault, I didn't speak on it much
I didn't see if as a problem, I would keep it from cunts
Rates could always tell, when I couldn't pronounce certain words, brain dead
Yeah should I be proud?
Anxiety was killing me, the doctors couldn't deal with me
Put me on a program cut me down on the pills and weed
All scared, cause I feel on my own
I told ‘em “let me chill’, now they think I'm dissing them bro
Waking up tired, I gotta take more pills
And I didn’t even wanna take ‘em, is this fucking for real?
Losing touch of myself, it's like reality's false
It's like I’m walking around without having a pulse
It's a feeling of death, or like nothing is left
'Cause there I'm holding my chest, just put a hole in my head
You see the older I get, It's getting scary as fuck
I'm like an eighteen in the head, I weren’t aware of those drugs
The shit that they 'cause, I talk to mirrors on walls
I don't need this shit ever, but to pills I will fall

[Verse 3]
I opened up on ‘No Rest’ told cunts everything
That I done ice, didn't leave out anything
I quit that shit, yeah I left it flat dead
That was 5 years ago, they still think I'm a crackhead
If that's what we going off, fuck me dead
In 5 years I'll be clean, they'll be calling me a Xanny head
Funny how the world works for a paycheck
Once the fame hit, I became a train wreck
I wasn’t shit anyway, so why does it count?
Why so many people love me? I can't figure it out
But I'm telling you now, don't you follow my path
Look you couldn’t if you tried, 'cause I'm going in hard
Fuck a poppin' a pill, just to go out today
How'd I end up like this? I don't know, it's a way
Well I'm blaming the fame, yeah I said it before
But it's enough to make me high, feel like ending it all, but I

[Verse 4]
Brush it off got my fans on my side too, and my girl and my brothers
And the whole crew
Spilling the truth, it's like all I can do
That's why I don't have time for rappers that are saying they're true
When they lie to their fans, apologize in the end
I never lied to mine and this is why I’m the man
I tell you what I'm going through, I don’t care what they think
That's why I'm triple popping pills, leaning over the sink
I'm almost fuckin' crying as I’m writing this shit
'Cause of all my close ones, and the lives I affect
I came from the bottom, I made it my problem
Created the option, now fame has adopting
My brain gotta stop it, insane I am not this
Strange we got Scott sick, I'ma watch a clock tick
Just fuck off, I said it just fuck off
If I won’t have my tablets I’ll find a bridge to jump off
Fucking idiots, thinking that the shit is cool
‘Till they dyin’ in the vomit of there own drool
What I meant to say? Don’t do what I done
I've cut down on the program, yeah I’ve won
Repped it from the street, turned into a star then
Caught a fucking habit on the Xanex but the bars went
Crazy and I'm just dealing with fame
I just want my fans to know that I’ll still be the same. I'm good",Kerser,2009,"[78, 71, 82, 76, 75, 74, 74, 81, 87, 88, 94, 96]",12

Do you think I'm special?
Do you think I'm nice?
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear
And the sounds you like
Are we just sinking in the ocean of faces?
It can't be possible, that rain can fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over the world that's dead

Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath, it's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover

I just want to leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere

I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade

Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don’t sit with denim
My marble floors are killing, gold cars are so relentless
Five girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists
Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians
God cover my soul, need it, can’t let it go
I know you get lonely when I ain’t home, on the road
I know I ain’t perfect, I’m out here working for the throne
I would take you along but then that college loan you’ll owe
Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us
Saying they all different but I don’t show them no effort
Underestimated that R8 then I tested
Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it
I’m blessed-ed, cross-sign baptism, West shit
Shit on anybody with opinions, you dead wrong
Go against a bull nigga head on
I'm too strong, eight arms, ticking to a bomb
Army stance, ready for war
We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor
Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored
They say my music knocks so I hope it open every door

We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens

Uhh, never take this shit to heart, I take indo to chest
And now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath
Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best
Though I do this to be heard, I'ma do it to death
We ain't cool with all of these niggas, I'm through with all of these niggas
You fool with all of these niggas, you lose like all of these (niggas)
Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lying in suits
Anybody riding with young'un will probably recoup
Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics
Finna be king but I’m way too proud to offer as minion
I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga
And don’t offer least of shit to these people’s opinions
I’m a king to these niggas, love a queen, fuck the bitches
Double MG, YMCMB cause we run this, you dig?
We all kings, give anything to my soft queens
I’m lost without them, when they around, I am Charles Sheen
Ralph...

[Chorus: Tyga]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

[Verse 3: Nas]
Uhh.. yeah, yeah
You're in the presence of a majestic, esoteric
Message from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected
I can say ghettoest cause I come from where metal spit
Praying to God I can slide and slip out the Devil’s grip
Won't pop another pill, can't drink another sip
Tryna slow down with this pussy, I can't, I love this shit
I seem to love these whips
A white Maserati's my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit
At night, where they murdered Herbie Drawz
That's the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball
See I'm born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home
College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom
Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gang bang
Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing
So that make you a queen, surviving anything
Escobar season begins so let the semis ring
Pimp of the year, I could smack your father
Not only with my hand but with a black revolver
I been in pressed silk since breast milk

These girls ain't got nothing on you...

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need

But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not trying to say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

83,That's How Country Boys Roll,"[Verse 1]
They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go

Tuxedo waiters, black tie
White table clothes and red wine
We've been planning, this night
Looking forward to it for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up
And you know I love showing you off
But watching your baby blue eyes
Dancing in the candle light glow
All I can think about, is getting you home

Ain't gonna last too long

Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present, they don't matter, now the future's sorted out

Think it's not what you say, what you say is way too complicated
For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out

[Chorus]
It's twenty seconds 'til the last call
You're going, ""Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey""

Oh - man, it's like...
It's beautiful how this all started, you know?
But uh... I'm'a just break this shit down for you real quick
Yeah, check
Yo!

[Verse 1]
I'm just spittin', livin', revealin' what I do
Roll with the family every time I step up to venues
I gotta pursue, have deadlines to meet
And gotta finish 'em before the late night creeps
The words I speak over beats never sleep, or never egotistical
Never cliche or stereotypical - from the heart
Whether it's concept or rhyme
I rub it in leave you feeling warm all at the same time
Ash it out on you broads but this ain't Escobar
It's G-baby Gavlyn, Gavlish or Gav-Nasty
Whatever cheesy alias you wanna call me
You get the point, get the picture
Read my lips, catch my drift
Your girl was born with a gift but I'm humble as well
Only five feet tall but rising high as hell
With acrylic nails and a white blouse to match
Reekin' like a weed stash who would have knew

(This is what I do)

[Hook]
Uplift your body and spirit
Bump the beats loud so you could hear it
Sooth your mind every time you hear me rhyme from line to line
Recognize I'm not trying to be the lyrical champion
Just your ordinary MC
Let you know music is what I do and breathe
Anybody bite the steeze foot to the teeth
'Cuz these lyrics are my love and I don't take them lightly

[Verse 2]
So who's rapping now? Cause nowadays that's the new style
But listen to the rappers that influencing these juveniles
How can this happen to something so true?
But it's been said the ongoing saga continues
Let me preview a little piece of myself
I'm a nicotine feind with needs don't like my weed with seeds
Rather compromise than disagree
Cause I understand the position of your two feet
Forget making enemies, but that's just me
Some cats are difficult - Inch under your senses and enhance your temple
But I'm able to blow your ass back
Cause I'm not tryna be skimpy in these raps
Perhaps, you should take a second while the record's spinning
What is it that you're saying? Are your beats just banging?
Well, whatever it is I give you the biz', influence these kids
To get your hands up to some real Hip-Hop shit

Got the news on Friday morning

Now you showed me how to die

I woke up to face my fear
While writing you this good bye song I found a tear

[Chorus]
I'm going to miss that smile

We get the bouncing outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow, we got paper to blow

So letting go ain't easy

And choking on the other
Always think there's something more
Is just around the corner

This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 1]
I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

[Chorus]
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know

The more I see, the less I know
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

Something that I just can't describe (Ah)
Am I the one and only? (Ah)

Later you'll carry me home
I wanna go undercover

Maybe we can burn this town

Can make me drop it all and pick up the phone
To hear her say that all's okay is all I need to know these days
Can't wait to see their faces when I get home

115,I Dreamed A Dream,"I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they tear your dreams to shame

She slept a summer by my side
And filled my days with endless wonder
She took my childhood in her stride
But she was gone when autumn came

And still I dream she’ll come to me
And we will spend the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
There are storms we cannot weather

So different now than what it seemed

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I love you
It'd be just for you
So when I'm touching you
Can I trust in you?
Can I trust in you? Oh babe

Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are confessions of a new lover
True colors, true colors

[Verse 2]
What's done is done
Now that I'm the only one
If you tell me I'll accept what you've been through, oh yeah
And I don't believe all this inconsistency
I've been hearing different stories about you

[Pre-Chorus]
So if I love you
It'd be just for you
So when I'm touching you
Can I trust in you?
Can I trust in you? Oh babe

[Chorus]
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors

True colors

[Bridge]
Baby, show me you're a keeper
It's been hard for me to keep up
You've been tryna keep me in the dark
But baby girl, I see you
Baby, show me you're a keeper
It's been hard for me to keep up
You've been tryna keep me in the dark
But baby girl, I see you

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

118,Half Of My Heart,"I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in
Like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you that I can't keep loving you
Oh, half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
I made a plan, stayed the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang
'Til the day you came
Showing me a another way and all that my love can bring

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you that I can't keep loving you
Oh, half of my heart
With half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall so far so long
Time to hold, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you
Than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you

With half of my, half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That half of my heart won't do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
Half of my heart is the part of a girl who's never truly loved anything

Oh, half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart

[Chorus: Drake]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

[Verse 1: Drake]

Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?

Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles

Some say that I'm their favorite but I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar, where the fuck is Stunna at?

From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro

I’m a lady twister, I kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit - blisters
Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’ll clueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers

You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret

'Cause when you waste it...
It's your life, don't-don't be stupid though...
(Your funk is the best. Take-take my body and give it the mind)
'Cause when you waste it..

[Verse 1:]
Nowwwwwwwwwwww I come from, the Oakland town
Task force roll and rock, cold cracked down
Young brothers my age makin dollars so long
Drive a brand new Benz with a cellular phone
See his diamonds and gold, call him Big Bank Bob
Got a ring for each finger and he can't get a job
This is not a song I made about crack
It's all about losin' what you can't get back
Cause the name of the game is to control yo' life
And all the things you do you must do them right
It's not my life, it's on you baby
What's really goin on is that cash money
How you make it, it doesn't matter to me
Work at McDonald's or just slang them ki's
Or you can be like me and go straight legit
Drive a brand new Benz and they can't say shit

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Partners in your face, ain't even your friend
Probably have to blast him if you see him again
And if you don't blast him you'll get shot in the head
Seven days later you'll be buried and dead
I can't be like that, the only thing you fear
Homeboy you can't see it but you know it's there
It's called tomorrow, whatcha gonna do with that
Cut school, sell a few dopefiends crack?
It's not a one-way street, it's more like a dead-end
So if you take it, you better turn back my friend
I know a lot of young brothers don't think things through
They really don't know what they wanna do
When you lag, you lose, you start payin your dues
You can't kick back and let your bankroll stack
You'll be stuck on stupid, for smokin a friend
Ten years from now you'll still be in the pen

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
I got my eighteens pumpin, ridin the five
People lookin at me like I stole the ride
Am I a gangster, player, makin them G's
Cocaine dealer with the Z's and V's
Can't tell em nothin, so I say, ""Whassup?""
They get mad, I don't give a fuck
I keep ridin, sidin, whippin and dippin
Look at all my homeboys trippin
They'll knock you out, one punch like the champ
Goin to jail is like summer camp
We shake hands one day, kill each other the next
And if you don't like it it's just like that
Cause I come from, the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by John the Pope
But since I have the chance, I'll say in the rhyme:
We have to stop the killin sometime (soon)

122,Doesn't Mean Anything,"[Verse 1]
Used to dream of being a millionaire without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over, that just won't be fair, darlin'
Rather be a poor woman livin' on the street, no food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over when you said goodbye

[Chorus]
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

[Verse 2]
Now I see myself through different eyes, it's no surprise
What being alone would make you realize
When it's over, all in love is fair
I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda, shoulda

[Chorus]
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

[Bridge]
I know I pushed you away
What can I do that will save our love?
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing, it's you that I want

[Chorus]
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone
(I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda, shoulda)
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all

This one goes out to the man who mines for miracles
This one goes out to the ones in need
This one goes out to the sinner and the cynical
This ain't about no apology
This road was paved by the hopeless and the hungry
This road was paved by the winds of change
Walking beside the guilty and the innocent
How will you raise your hand when they call your name?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that your saints and sinners bleed
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

This one's about anyone who does it differently
This one's about the one who cusses and spits
This ain't about our livin' in a fantasy
This ain't about givin' up or givin' in
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow

Childhood living is easy to do

You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
With all the charms of a woman
You've kept the secret of your youth
Bookmark it, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Young girl, you're out of your mind

Better run, girl

So bad it makes him cry
Beneath your perfume and makeup
You're just a baby in disguise
Get out of here
Before you have the time to change your mind
'Cause I'm afraid you'll go too far

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so

Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once?
Instead of flying off the handle!
I hope you're happy

I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever
I hope you think you're clever

[ELPHABA, spoken]
I hope you're happy

I hope you're happy, too
I hope you're proud how you
Would grovel in submission, to feed your own ambition

[GLINDA & ELPHABA]
So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy right now

[GLINDA, spoken]
Elphie, listen to me, just say you're sorry!

[sung]
You can still be with the wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted

[ELPHABA, spoken]
I know

[sung]
But I don't want it
No, I can't want it anymore
Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules
Of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap!

It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

[GLINDA]
Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?

[ELPHABA]
I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But 'til I try, I'll never know!
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love I guess I've lost
Well, if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost!

I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

[spoken]
Glinda, come with me. Think of what we could do, together!

[sung]
Unlimited
Together, we're unlimited
Together we'll be the greatest team there's ever been
Glinda, dreams the way we planned 'em

[GLINDA]
If we work in tandem

[GLINDA & ELPHABA]
There's no fight we cannot win
Just you and I, defying gravity
With you and I defying gravity

They'll never bring us down!

Well, are you coming?

I hope you're happy
Now that you're choosing this

[ELPHABA]

You, too

I hope it brings you bliss

[GLINDA & ELPHABA]
I really hope you get it
And you don't live to regret it
I hope you're happy in the end
I hope you're happy my friend

[ELPHABA]
So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky!
As someone told me lately
""Everyone deserves the chance to fly!""
And if I'm flying solo
At least I'm flying free
To those who ground me
Take a message back from me

Tell them how I am defying gravity!
I'm flying high, defying gravity!
And soon, I'll match them in renown
And nobody in all of Oz
No wizard that there is or was
Is ever gonna bring me down!

You are the one to bring me back to earth
See, you remind where I came from

Think we met before, another life
So when you want a round two
I could meet you outside

Two cups with the mud flowin'

LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang

I just want the real, baby, you can have my last
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back

[Verse 1: Nick Cannon]
Ain't no comin' back, that's a fact, this the invitation
Told Joe to lean back, don't get hit with this retaliation
I fuck with Crack, but the white boy he fuck with crack (Crack)
Pills and smack, Shady 'bout to relapse
Call Kim, somebody get Hailie
And that other kid you raisin', that ain't even your baby (Daddy)
Took a page out of Drake book, this might get a GRAMMY
We goin' back to back 'til you respond, on the family
My baby mama killed you off a decade ago
You're still cryin' about it, bitch, now who really the ho?
I called Joe to set you up and you fell for the job
Slim won't show for the video 'cause he terrified of my squad
I heard your chauffeur got a video of you suckin' a cock
You paid him off, then laid him off, now who really the opp?
Suge called me the new Pac, I ain't no killer but don't push me
How the fuck y'all got me battlin' Elvis Pussly? Nigga

You used to beef with Nickelodeon Nick
He called Hit and I come with the mop and get on my custodian shit

Got spazzed, put Eminem in the bag, it's Halloween
This ain't an 8 Mile battle, man, I'll do you awful
My competition in the target, I think it's Marshall, holla

Come on Nick, that's Marshall, you don't need help
Nigga, you a rider? No safety, fuck a seatbelt
What? Is he out of his mind? I got a Glock
And don't Eminem belong on the side of a nine? That's crazy
Man, you act like Nick hurtin' your dreams
You an M&M, how you mad a star burst on the scene? (Haha, you get that?)
Let me find out you still in that trailer park, this how we do
Run up and shoot the trailer (Blaow), this the preview, Clips, nigga

He ain't really for the culture
Fucked his baby mama in a choker (Choker)
Picked her up like a chauffeur (Skrrt)
On that Twitter wall like a poster (Ugh)
On foenem she'll get cracked like cocaine mixed with soda
When I take her soul, if the bitch die, I'ma still eat her, I'm a vulture
Why Mariah name in your mouth?
You forty-seven chasin' clout
""Obsessed"" came out in '08 and you just puttin' some out? (Damn)
'Cause Marshall think he a ape, but a white boy with a backpack
I do this shit for my real niggas, not the white boys tryna act black, on God (Eazy)

'Cause it's a matter of time he hangin', right?
Eminem's a bitch for bringin' bullshit up that's not true
Say some shit and then when shit get a little hot, everybody wanna fall back
Or they wanna run around with all these police
You know, that ain't part-you gon' be a rapper
Any time you're a rapper, you shouldn't have a whole bunch of police badges around you
Any time you be a rapper, you're supposed to be able to meet up with motherfuckers and handle your business
But all we gotta do is get that motherfucker in the ring with you and you're gonna beat the dog shit out of him
That motherfuckin' simple
Nick Cannon is a force in it-itself
And if you have proper time for conversation, y'all got the same energy for doin' stuff for the people
He not scared to do stuff for the people
So if this dude want a real target on his back, that's on him
But don't talk no shit and go and hide
And you know what you call a man who ain't gon' stand up and fight? He's a bitch
We should tell the motherfuckers in Detroit he got twenty-four hours to respond or they need kick his ass out that mothafuckin' city

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth under the disco ball

Here's the opportunity

Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

But I can't break through it all

I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit-and-run

The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh so bad, it hurt
But girl, in case you haven't heard

[Chorus]
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover

Hot sweat and blurry eyes
We're spinnin' 'round a roller coaster ride

You drove me crazy every time we touched
Now I'm so broken that I can't get up
Oh girl, you make me such a lush

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
Love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight

Love you forever, but now I'm sober

141,Good Girls Go Bad,"[Verse 1: The Game]
Since Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There’s missing women out there, let’s just focus on them
This song is dedicated to Natalie Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair

Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me, yeah
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us

Drizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives
Like, ""uhh, them is basketball wives?""
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass ""get on!""
Disrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like ""hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world""
Get busy girl, drink that rosé 'til you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Don spray
That’s your girl? Nigga go on and make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like ""let's ride""

146,Jump Then Fall,"[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never going to leave you
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Verse 2]
I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh, over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath, then jump, then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby

The bottom's going to drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
And people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is going to come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
Whoa oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me

Be there, never going to leave you
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here

She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, ""'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody""
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon

Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches

Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols

That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Look ma, no hands
I love this American ride

Momma gets her rocks off watching' Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his ass off paying' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learning how to be cool
Living in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl

Two times in
I've been struck dumb by a voice that
Speaks from deep beneath peerless water that's
Twice as clear as heaven
Twice as loud as reason
Deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
Just as never ending
Current's mouth below me
Opens up around me
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing
Surrounds and drowns and wipes me away
But I'm so comfortable, so comfortable

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
You're saturating me
How could I let this bring me
Back to my knees?

[Verse 2]
Third time in
I've been baptized by your voice that
Screams from deep beneath the cold black water that's
Half as high as heaven
Half as clear as reason
Cold and black like silt on the riverbed
Just as never ending
Current's mouth below me
Opens up around me
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing
Surrounds and drowns and wipes me away
But I'm so comfortable, so comfortable

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
You're saturating me
How could I let this happen?
Why don't you kill me?
I am weak and numb and insignificant
How could I let this bring me
Back to my knees?

150,Throw It In The Bag,"[Hook]
She all on me cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentley coupes
Got no needs, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop

[Verse 1]
Swimming in Polo, sleeping in Jordans
I bought her cell phone and I don’t even much call it
New imports make her feel important
No bullshit, nigga, no Ben Gordon
Get her information, take her on vacation
Give her dope dick, now she under the sedation
Wake her in the morning, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her go shopping, I can't wait til she get back
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweat pants
She wear that on my jet, I fuck her after jet lag
I take her to the vet cause she a bad bitch
You can't be broke and happy, so me, I'm madd rich
I'm talking Young Money shit, she love the way I think
L’Oreal all over my bathroom sink
Betsey Johnson all over my bedroom counter
My pockets too deep, I fuck around and drown her

[Verse 2]
Fucking on Versace, napping on satin
I love to hit it backwards: call it pig latin
I bought her ass a Mac, now we be iChattin
Nigga swag-jackin', but I got my patent
Fresh out the salon, I took her to Milan
I speak a little French and her's is no better then mine
I pass her the blunt, she probably hit it one time
Catch us at the game sitting on the baseline
We can call a timeout, take a lil time out
Pockets too deep, shorty, you gonna have to climb out
Faviana prom dress with your spine out
And I live on the beach, you can get that panty line out
She wants to own me and I ain't trying to fight it
She said it's her dick, she got it copyrighted
And I don't pay for pussy because her pussy's priceless
I go fishing in it, and I ain’t a Pisces

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?

And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

Lay down your arms
Give up the fight

And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass

Lay down your arms

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don’t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

Pt. II

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build",Eminem,2009,"[69, 19]",2

156,Ain't No Rest For The Wicked,"[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, ""I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way.""
I said, ""You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said:

[Chorus]
""Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

[Verse 2]
Not even 15 minutes later I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, ""Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice.""
I told him, ""You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask:
What made you want to live this kind of life?""
He said:

[Chorus]
""There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

[Verse 3]
Well now a couple hours past and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills

[Chorus]
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good",Cage The Elephant,2009,"[89, 90, 83, 99, 92, 96, 99, 94, 99, 94, 92]",11
157,The Other Side Of The Door,"[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Bridge]
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, ""There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it""
What I mean is

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you",Taylor Swift,2009,"[94, 23]",2

I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

159,Forever & Always,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And  it rains in your bedroom

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

And they want a show-oh-oh-oh, yeah (Free Chilly!)

Yeah! Ugh! a fresh cool young Lu'
Trying to cash his microphone check, 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung? You?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you—you come too
And then it hit me—standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pyoom!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade...-uh
We want it to braid
Meaning, we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage...-uh
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Ugh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear
The crowd is here

So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha""
""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha""

[Verse 2]
If our love is running out of time
I won't count the hours, rather be a coward
When our words collide
I'm gonna drown you out before I lose my mind

[Bridge]
I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough

[Hook]
I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak

165,Under,"[Текст песни «Город под подошвой»]

[Куплет 1]
Дон ли, Волга ли течёт — котомку на плечо
Боль в груди — там тайничок, открытый фомкой, не ключом
Сколько миль ещё? Перелет короткий был не в счёт
Долгий пыльный чёс, фургон набит коробками с мерчём
Верим — подфартит, наши постели портативны
Менестрелю два пути: корпоратив или квартирник
Схемы однотипны, все теперь MC
Ведь, смену породив, мы здесь достигли смены парадигмы
Теперь рэп — многопартийный; бэттлов наплодив
Я смотрю в зеркало по типу: «Сколько бед наворотил ты!»
Я б весь рэп поработил, но всё время в пути
У индустрии нервный тик, валокордин — стенокардийным
Соберите суд, но победителей не судят
Мы первые кроманьонцы — мы выбились в люди
Не пизди! Я кладу на вас, челядь, пятикратно
Ведь мы выступаем сильно, будто челюсть питекантропа

[Припев]
Весь мой рэп, если коротко, про то, что
Уж который год который город под подошвой
В гору, когда прёт; потом под гору, когда тошно
Я не то, что Гулливер, но всё же город под подошвой
Город под подошвой, город под подошвой
Светофоры, госпошлины, сборы и таможни
Я не знаю, вброд или на дно эта дорожка
Ты живёшь под каблуком, у меня город под подошвой

[Куплет 2]
Мимо тополей и спелого хлеба полей
Где привидение Есенина, крест, молебен, елей
Из минивэна вижу землю, вижу небо над ней
Мы всё преодолеем — если нет, то я не водолей
Наша земля топит одиночек как щенят
Был чужой, но Охра, Порчи, Илья — больше, чем семья
Бомбу ночью сочинял, что есть мочи начинял
Я так хотел принадлежать чему-то большему, чем я
Мир пустой, хоть с каждым вторым перезнакомься
Я не биоробот с позитивной лыбой комсомольца (ay)
Избавь меня от ваших панацей, домашний Парацельс
Ведь для меня ебашить — самоцель
Подустал? Нам насрать! Тони Старк как стандарт
Пара стран, автострад: Краснодар, Татарстан, Москвабад
Паспорта, гам эстрад — нарасхват
Хоть по МКАД'у на старт, хоть на Мадагаскар (Ты знаешь!)

[Припев]
Весь мой рэп, если коротко, про то, что
Уж который год который город под подошвой
В гору, когда прёт; потом под гору, когда тошно
Я не то что Гулливер, но всё же город под подошвой
Город под подошвой, город под подошвой
Светофоры, госпошлины, сборы и таможни
Я не знаю, вброд или на дно эта дорожка
Ты живёшь под каблуком, у меня город под подошвой

[Куплет 3]
Дай силёнок тут не свернуть и не сломаться
Есть маршрут и есть на трассе населённый пункт
И там нас сегодня ждут; нытик, не будь женственным
У Руслана в деке саундтреки к путешествию
Снова ебло заспано, снова подъём засветло
Снова броник, снова дорога, мешок за спину
Всё наскоро, в поле насрано, дождь, пасмурно
Мост в Асгард — после, пусть просто везёт с транспортом
Я делаю каждый свой куплет автопортретом
Час на чек, читаем рэп, как логопед под марафетом
Трафарет на парапетах: лого на стене везде
Моё ученье — всем, как Магомета с Бафометом
Я — звезда? Дайте тёплый плед и капюшон
Салфетки жопу вытирать — и всё, отметка «хорошо»
Раньше говорили: «Я бы с ним в разведку не пошёл»
Я с тобой в тур не поехал, ты проверку не прошёл (Homie, знай!)

[Припев]
Мой рэп, если коротко, про то, что
Уж который год который город под подошвой

Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

[Chorus 1: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

[Chorus 1: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Good morning, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

[Chorus 2: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them

[Legacy]
Jerrrrrk! I'm so cocky with it
I got my eye shut closed like Rocky hit it
Got your girl on my swag she lovin them jerkin songs
Like the new iPod just touch it, it turn her on
And when the bass start beatin and the waist I'm beatin
Done I got on my way I'm leavin
She like where you goin? I ain't got my shoes and purse
I said it's none of your concern, and she yelled ""You're a jerk!""
So I walked out the door, called Ben J
Told him it's a function he said I'm on my way
We pulled up to the party I take off my shirt and
Got geeked up, e'rybody jerkin
We was jerkin to the right, jerkin to the left
Then she popped up out of nowhere, she was still half dressed
She like f'real jerk, you lookin for this stuff
And the whole party heard her but all I could hear was

[Hook: Legacy]
Wah, wah, wah wah wah ""You're a jerk!""
Why you trippin? I ain't even do nuttin ""You're a jerk!""
""You're a jerk!"" I'm a jerk? You ain't never lie
But ay, do me a favor, call me jerk one more time
""You're a jerk!"" (I know) ""You're a jerk!"" (I know)
""You're a jerk!"" (I know) ""You're a jerk!"" (Ay, ay)

""Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk"" (Jerky)
""Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk"" (Jerky)

[Ben J.]
Ha ha!! .. Everything quiet and the bass real hard
And I stay geeked up never been a retard
Got a New Boy swag and this here for y'all
So they gotta keep it separate like the Jim Crow laws
I'm a beast, I'm a king, and I guess I'm a jerk
And I go through big problems cause your boy here a flirt
Man you call me a bother wit'cha lil' jerk lines
Then you say you brought it up, but the jerk is mine
You squeezin, I'm squeezin, but your style is whack
Why you comin to the front? You can push that back
Got your girl on the side, she tossin a lil' stuff
While she textin on the phone Ben J. hit it rough
So I did it was good and I quickly got dressed
She was like where you goin? There's another girl naked
She screamed out loud Ben J. ""You're a jerk!""
And I had nothin to say but sorry that it hurts

And it don't seem so lonely

Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say (Mmh)
""Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today"" (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp shit flying high (Flying high)
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky)
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest (Oh)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

[Hook: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Hey, oh, it comes around)
And it knocks you down (Hey, yeah)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Ooh, when it knocks you down) (Hey)
Sometimes love comes around (Ooh, whoa, yeah, comes around)
And it knocks you down (Oh)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Ooh, when it knocks you down, knocks you down)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that, bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call
(Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall, until it comes around, hey

[Hook: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo, Both]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Comes around, whoa)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Get back up when it knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around) (When love comes around)
And it knocks you down (Eh eh) (Oh oh)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Eh eh) (Oh oh, when it knows you down, knocks you down)

[Outro: Both, Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens (Eh)
But when it happens (Uh huh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down (Oh, no, when it knocks you down)

She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said ""Y'all get in""

[Verse 2]
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

[Chorus]
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

[Verse 3]
Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

[Chorus]
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah

It's late at night and I can't sleep
Missing you just runs too deep
Oh, I can't breathe thinking of your smile

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every kiss I can't forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God, I wish I could make you see
'Cause I know this flame isn't dying

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I gotcha lil bro, I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood, let's go
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right

178,Temporary Home,"[Verse 1]
Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

[Verse 2]
Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night, she whispers to her baby girl
""Someday we'll find our place here in this world""

[Chorus]
This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home

[Verse 3]
Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, ""Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday""
He looks up and says, ""I can see God's face""

[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you dear
Because I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers are
Right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone

[Bridge]
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
As many times as I blink, I'll think of you tonight
I'll think of you tonight

[Verse 3]
When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you

I'd whisper in your ear

And Billy with a pool cue starring down an eight ball, lookin' at Kelly with a rack

Out in the country, back roads and one horse towns

We talk the talk, and walk the walk
And do the Honky Tonk Stomp

Cooler in the tool box, drinkin' every last drop...won't let ya take it in there
Whiskey high, two dudes stumblin' out the back door. Bouncers help 'em take it outside
Through the fussin' and the cussin', & the shovin' and the pushin'...well, it really ain't much of a fight

Out in the country, back roads and one horse towns

We talk the talk, and walk the walk

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine

And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""

When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop

I've practiced this for hours, gon' 'round and 'round
And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrappin' this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

[Chorus]
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise

[Verse 2]
It came out like a river, once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
It felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

[Chorus]
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to save

I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why

[Intro: Diddy]
You wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. These niggas is roaches. These niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals. I'm tryna push you to supreme bein'. You don't wanna motherfuckin'... You don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by
You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
""Blast for me"" – the last words from my nigga
On the pavement, born killers, body shivers
Drug money, dollar figures
Hustlers movin' out of rentals, art of war is mental
Havin' sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
So it's bang, no survivors
Only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
Stalkin' niggas on their IG's, never; I be
Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno, we all we got the creed of Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You fuckin' wanna walk around with these niggas? What the fuck is their culture? Where the fuck is their souls at? What defines you? These niggas with these fuckin' silly looks on their faces. You wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with God, nigga? Make up your goddamn mind

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and takin' their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine, until it's even: kill
Like I'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh

We’ll have a mansion and some fly maids

I’mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin’ to on Oscar day
'specially if she can’t get that dress from Oscar de

200,Rain,"[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light

201,Sounds Like Life To Me,"Got a call last night from an old friend's wife
Said I hate to bother you
Johnny Ray fell off the wagon
He's been gone all afternoon
I know my buddy so I drove to Skully's
And found him at the bar
I say hey man, what's going on
He said I don't know where to start

Sarah's old car's about to fall apart
And the washer quit last week
We had to put momma in the nursing home
And the baby's cutting teeth
I didn't get much work this week
And I got bills to pay
I said I know this ain't what you wanna hear
But it's what I'm gonna say

(Chorus)
Sounds like life to me it ain't no fantasy
It's just a common case of everyday reality
Man I know it's tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
It sounds like life to me

Well his face turned red and he shook his head
He said you don't understand
Three kids and a wife depend on me
And I'm just one man
To top it off I just found out
That Sarah's 2 months late
I said hey bartender set us up a round
We need to celebrate

(Chorus)
Sounds like life to me plain old destiny
Yeah the only thing for certain is uncertainty
You gotta hold on tight just enjoy the ride
Get used to all this unpredictability
Sounds like life

Man I know its tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
Sounds like life to me

Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst

We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?

Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good

And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time

I'm forever young

Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears

Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

210,Her Diamonds,"[Verse 1]
'Oh what the hell' she says 'I just can't win for losing'
And she lays back down
Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doin'
Like I don't know now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine (imagine)
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

[Chorus]
And she says 'ooh
I can't take no more'
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
Way down (way down)

[Verse 2]
Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night (all night)
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

[Chorus]
And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
And tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be all right
She'll be all right
Just not tonight

She down with it
She tried her best and now she can't win, It's hard

I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard

Have her naked cookin' breakfast while I kick my feet up
Bout to go to work no need to roll the sleeves up

215,Living For The Night,"[Verse 1]
Every day's a lifetime without you
Hard to get through, since you’ve gone
So I do the only thing I know how to, to get by
I’m livin' for the night

[Verse 2]
I’ve drawn all the curtains in this old house
To keep the sun out, and off of my face
Friends stop by to check - in ‘cause I’ve checked out
I tell 'em I’m fine, I’m just livin' for the night

[Chorus]
Daylight can’t hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbye
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
I’m livin' for the night

[Instrumental Break]

I’m a whole lot easier to talk to, when I’ve had a few, I settle down
Whiskey kills the man you’ve turned me into

Go to my head girl every time
And I get drunk on you
I lose control and then
And here I go again

I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you’re gone

Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind

You tattooed on my heart

I get a check and fuck it up
Hundreds stacked tall as a monster truck
I be the last one acting tough
We gon' shoot first and watch 'em duck
Been all in, I can call their bluff
Yeah, I done sold a lot of things but I would never sell my soul (My soul)
Diamonds biting and I got a Rollie yellow gold (It's gold)
I am not lying in the stories that I told
I ain't tryna fuck on a new bitch my bros don't know

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I don't like taking chances, I like fucking hoes I already know
Yeah, yeah
Give into my thoughts, I can't ignore these voices any more
Pendant flooded with rocks, I like it better when my neck is cold
Birdies by the flock, chasin' my crew everywhere we go
See them XO boys like, ""There they go""
The money goin' where they go
Lifestyle so impeccable
Diss, we gon' turn you vegetable

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Pockets filled up with faces, I see dead people everywhere I go
Spend it but I work too hard just to waste it on a petty ho
Rockin' my closet, I can't tell you my favorite, I got plenty clothes
Got a big bag, got some bags of dope
I don't do it myself, but I got some coke
Protect my wealth, gotta check for the pole
If rap don't work, goin' back to the bowl
Say you real, you ain't solid though
Check the paperwork and you told
Yeah, grew up in the jungle now I'm leadin' a pack of wolves
When we come around, all your bitches gettin' took
All my haters keep getting madder, as they should
That's a good indication that I'm doing good

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I don't like taking chances, I like fucking hoes I already know
Yeah, yeah
Give into my thoughts, I can't ignore these voices any more
Pendant flooded with rocks, I like it better when my neck is cold

Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""

What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct

But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

The storm is on the horizon
I’m standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip and it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I’ma be here 'til it’s done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I’m the one

Tell them that I’m the one

Tell them that I’m the one

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm the one, baby, yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby, you on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mhm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt, you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip - yeaaaalm!

So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
Started off in that Chevrolet, but it's Ferraris I gotta drive

I need a hundred million no compromise, I'm a double X-L nigga
Magazine and condom size, see what I seen and be traumatized
I don't wait, I marinate, variate, everyday
Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
My weed loud, I need a hearing aid
Livin' life behind a pair of shades
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar
For all the bullshit that I hear a day
I did it

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type

Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?

How many secrets can you keep?

That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

They said my prayer was a weapon, that I should dust it off
Or maybe every time I took a step I didn't wait for God
(wait for God)
I don't know but if I'm weak I know that He is strong (strong!)
He sees it, all the hurt inside of me that keeps me numb (uh!)
And if I keep this unforgiveness how do I move on
When it was His Son who took the cross from me where I belong

Uh-huh, and I know sometimes I question this path I'm on
Have the grace, erase my past mistakes now I have it all
Waiting for so long with this pain inside till I finally call (I did)
Maybe where I wasn't, true love is what it reminds me of (woo)
Never have I felt the peace like only you provide (Yeah)

Were having us some beers and

And all the hell we raised

Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""

'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death

He said ""These damn things will kill me yet""

He left his fortune to

His kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well

To just say thanks and pray

241,She Is Love,"[Verse 1]
Oh, when the sunshine beckons to you
And your wings begin to unfold
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
Are going to keep me from the cold
And if the sword is heated among you
And its words may wound my soul
You can fill me up with what you've got
Because my heart's been keeping old

She is love
And I believe her when she speaks

You're in all my thoughts of passion
And the dreams of my delight

Human. Don't you know how to greet a new pal? Turn around and shake my hand

Hehehe, the old whoopee cushion in the hand trick. It's always funny

Hey, anyway, never thought that today
A little human in a striped shirt would come my way
What a gaffe, that's a laugh, when you shook my hand-
'Spose I should go 'head, say, hi
Hi. My name is Sans

I'm s'posed to be lookin' out for humans
But I just don't feel like capturin' you, man

There's lots to do, there's so much to see
Here in the underground, if you just stick with me
But watch out for my brother, if you do not mind
He's dedicated to capturin' one of your kind

I think that's him over there, so hide behind the light
Come on and trust me, kid, you're gonna be alright, uh huh
And don't worry about the gate, it's not gonna stop anyone

[PAPYRUS]
NOT GOING TO STOP WHO, SANS?

[SANS]
Don't feel bad, bro. It might stop any two. 'Sup?

[PAPYRUS]
You know what ""SUP"", brother! It's been eight days and you still haven't recalibrated the traps! You just stay outside your station! What are you even doing?

[SANS]
Staring at this lamp. It's really cool. Do you wanna look?

[PAPYRUS]
I don't have time, Sans! What if a human comes through?
I must be ready, get them before they're gone!
That way people will love and respect me
More than they do already! I will be THE ONE!

[SANS]
That doesn't rhyme

[PAPYRUS]
They won't believe I've captured a human
And the great Papyrus will get all that he deserves!
Like a hedge carved in the shape of my head
People will ask to be my friend, and I will accept with verve!

Can't you see it, brother? I will bathe in a shower of kisses every morning!

[SANS]
Well, maybe the lamp could help those kisses light up your life

[PAPYRUS]
SANS YOU ARE NOT HELPING, YOU LAZYBONES!

[SANS]
Take it easy. I've gotten a ton of work done today. A SKELE-ton

[PAPYRUS]
SANS!

[SANS]
Come on, you're smiling

[PAPYRUS]
I AM AND I HATE IT! Your rimshot interrupted my music! Why does someone so great as me have to work so hard to get some recognition?

[SANS]
Sounds like you're really working yourself... down to the bone


[PAPYRUS]
Ugh. I must get back to work! As for YOUR work, put a little more... BACKBONE into it!

Nyeh heh heh heh heh heh!
Heh

[SANS]
Hey. Come on out, it'll be okay
Better go, he might come this way
Or, if you want, you could stay
And listen to some jokes

Hey, one quick favor, if I may
My brother's been kind of down
And it would just make his day
If a human came to town

[SANS AND Chorus]
Hey (Hey) you're not in danger, don't fuss, (don't fuss)
He won't hurt you, Papyrus
If you keep going this way

[SANS]
See you around, kid

[Chorus]
Say (say)
What a lovely winter day
As the snow is falling down
To wash our cares away

Hold fast your determination
Hold as long the trail you go

Hold fast your determination

Touch your ears and your neck and play with your pearls

Because I gotta keep on fuckin til I see a lot of white stuff

It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Niggas don't want war—I'm a martian, with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right; your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite; I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts—like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit time to inaugurate
My P.E.-conglomerates 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame-spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be Simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of Theodora, my heart go
""Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom""
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that 'K
Like every day in every way, and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is, ""Pray""
'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best—I'm like, ""You're so right""
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

[Interlude]
Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass-corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E., Public Enemy, Assassinate us—bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything, son
Fuck government, fuck—listenin' and shit
You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Stopped spitting fire 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
Wouldn't mind a feign of interest for your finest interest
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
'Cause P.E.'s about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', ""Fuck censorship!""
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
'Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's 'cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond—nigga

I spent fifteen hundred dollars on your damn dog's collar
Put new spinners on you escalate
I swear I almost started crying
When you brought up being' diamonds
Lord I'm spending more than I'm getting paid
You got more purses than Versace
Got more rings that Liberace
Fill your closes full of fancy shoes
All my credit cards are Cooking
Girl you don't know what your putting' me through
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you

[Verse 2]
You got me walking' past the fellas
Holdin' drinks with pink umbrellas
On some island that I can't even spell
Then we slide over to Gucci
Right before we go for sushi
That's a version of my personal hell
You just spent all day long trying on Louis Vitton
There's a thousand things that I'd rather do
Lord my mom would beat me senseless
If she saw what I was spending on you
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you

[Verse 3]
You gonna break my bank before too long
I'm taking out a loan
But when you turn your kind of loving' on
Honey I just can't say no, no no no no no no

You gonna break my bank before too long
I'm running out of dough
But when you turn you kind of magic on
Honey I just can't say no, no no no

[Verse 5]
Maybe I'll play the stock market
Put some money in my pocket
Ain't no telling what your gonna need next
I need to steal a Sherman tank
Just to break into a bank
I pray to God this song will be a success
All my buddies think it's funny
'Cause I'm spending all my money
On some honey like there's something to prove
Cause for a little of your loving
There ain't nothing much that I wouldn't do
It's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure with you

You've got your motive, you set the scene
So how about another taste
Or would you like to remind me why we are here?
As I walk to the water to cleanse off the blood on my hands
The weight of this crime leaves a stain in the sand
I hope new tides come to wash me clean for good

[Chorus 1]
You know that I fought with many and I won for some
We stared at ourselves 'til our breaking point
We wear our bruises like watermarks
The life and the death of the wild at heart

[Verse 2]
This empty bottle, this busted hand
Highlights mistakes of a broken man
He won't speak up, no, he won't come out of his hole
We were led to believe that the language of love was god
So few were forgiven

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll lead a march to the wall
And we'll pull it down
So we can rebuild it

I fought with many and I won for some
We stared at ourselves 'til our breaking point
We wear our bruises like watermarks
The life and the death of the wild at heart

With no sign of warning, no raised alarm
We still wear our bruises, we show our scars

Or sittin' around smokin' weed
I must seem more like a friend in need
And I boast that it is meant to be

[Chorus]
But, in all honesty, I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And in all honesty, I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

[Verse 2]
And she doesn't like the friends that I make
Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
She just gets bored sitting by the lake
Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache
And I boast that it is meant to be

[Chorus]
But, in all honesty, I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move

We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now

[Verse 1: Avelino]
(Uh), Big amounts
How'm I gonna get these figures? Shit to figure out
Never got a look in, I just had to listen out
If all he's got for me's an ounce of B, then tell that nigga bounce
'Cause when shit was tough, I was tough as shit, for the fun of it
Now my undercover lover, loves me for the coverage
I made drinks, could've built a pub, with the publishing
But I'm tryna build an empire, whilst you're watching it (yeah)
I mind my business on my own
Ironically I got a company, that's with my bros
And there's tonnes of women, that's relationship goals
I'm still soul-searching, that's why I don't trust a soul, I'm a lone wolf
Make her drop her top, I've got no roof
When I pull up on her in the winter, I'm a cold yout'
Where do you go to? When you're that go to nigga
I'ma go from selling O's, to the O2, (woo) yeah

[Chorus: Haile]
I be so, so fine, with this shit (so, so fine)
Had to run a mile on that bitch (run a mile)
Oh, you know it is, what it is, yeah (what it is!)

We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now (woo-oo-oo)
We got the models and the Cristal
Flexing on you niggas, 'cause we rich now

[Verse 2: Avelino]
I remember having nothing
I still speak about the bottom
I'm the topic of discussion, oh (yeah)
Still having fun, at the functions
I impress her, then I press her, listening to touch ah button
I'm so fresh, so clean, drinking til' I'm lean, no promethazine
Cash rules everything around me, they don't get no cream
I just handled mamas rent, so no rental please
But I might just go and put my Barbie in some Kenzo jeans
This life never chose me, it's the life I chose
We just made a killing, could've died I know
My calling was so instrumental, xylophone
Could've left with keys, but we left on a higher note
Yeah, I've been a sinner
But I gave my all, I pray my lord is a forgiver
Now I got tears of joy, crying me a river
I just hit the lick, and now a niggas drowning in some liquor
Oh yeah

[Chorus: Haile]
I be so, so fine, with this shit (so, so fine)
Had to run a mile on that bitch (run a mile)

252,Overcome,"[Verse 1]
Now the darkness fades
Into new beginnings
As we lift our eyes to a hope beyond
All creation waits
With an expectation
To declare the reign of the Lord our God

[Chorus]
We will not be moved
When the earth gives way
For the risen One has overcome
And for every fear
There's an empty grave
For the risen One has overcome

[Verse 2]
Now the silence breaks
In the name of Jesus
As the heavens cry let the earth respond
All creation shouts
With a voice of triumph
To declare the reign of the Lord our God

[Chorus]
We will not be moved
When the earth gives way
For the risen One has overcome
And for every fear
There's an empty grave
For the risen One has overcome

[Bridge]
He shall reign forever
Strongholds now surrender
For the Lord our God has overcome
Who can be against us?
Jesus our Defender
He is Lord and He has overcome
He shall reign forever
Strongholds now surrender
For the Lord our God has overcome
Who can be against us?
Jesus our Defender
He is Lord and He has overcome!..

[Chorus]
We will not be moved
When the earth gives way
For the risen One has overcome
And for every fear
There's an empty grave
For the risen One has overcome
We will not be moved
When the earth gives way
For the risen One has overcome
And for every fear
There's an empty grave
For the risen One has overcome...

Wo-oh, yeh (Yeh-yeh)
Este e' el verdadero remix, ¡baby! (Na-na)
Eso e' así (Ozuna)
Paso mucha' noche' pensándote
Yo no sé ni cómo ni cuándo fue (Eh)
Pero sólo sé que yo recordé (Eh-eh)
Cómo te lo hacía yo aquella vez (Oh-oh)
Sí, yo no puedo seguir solo (Jeje)
Pero sé que te boté (Pero sé; que te boté)

[Estribillo: Ozuna]
De mi vida te boté, yeh, y te boté (Oh-oh)
Te di banda y te solté, yo te solté (Oh-oh)
Pal' carajo usté' se fue, y usté' se fue (Na-na)
De mi vida te boté, yo te boté, yeh, yeh, mami (Ozuna)

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
Baby, la vida e' un ciclo (Wuh)
Y lo que no sirve yo no lo reciclo (No)
Así que de mi vida muévete
Que si te lo meto e' pa' recordar un T.B.T., yeh (Yeh)
Ya yo me cansé de tus mentira'
Ahora hay una más dura que me tira (Yeh)
Todo tiene su final, todo expira (Yeh)
Tú ere' pasado y el pasado nunca vira
Arranca pal' carajo (¡Wuh!), mi cuerpo no te necesita (No)
Lo que pide e' un perreo sucio en La Placita
No creo que lo nuestro se repita
Dale, prende un Phillie, deja uno ready pa' ahorita, yeh (¡Brr!)

[Pre-Estribillo: Bad Bunny]
Odio saber que en ti una ve' má' yo confié
Odio to' lo' ""te amo"" que mil vece' te texteé
Baby, mejor que tú, ahora tengo como die'
Lo nuestro iba en un Bugatti y te quedaste a pie

[Estribillo: Bad Bunny]
Yo te boté; te di banda y te solté, yo te solté
Pal' carajo te mandé, yo te mandé
Y a tu amiga me clavé, me la clavé
Fuck you, hijo 'e puta, yeh (¡Huh!)

[Verso 2: Darell]
(Esta e' la verdadera vuelta, ¿oíste, baby'?)
Bebé, yo te boté (¡Ja!)
Y desde que te di esa' botá', las gata' son de tre' en tre' (Eso e' así)
Si tú quiere', pregunta, si no me cree' (Baby)
Que ya no tengo estré', pa' completar las filas son express (¡Ja-ja!)
¿Tú viste cómo el mundo se te fue al revé'?
Y yo con ella en R.D. (Jajajaja), que me enamoró el día que la probé
Yo ya no creo que vuelva y te dé, mami, porque el servicio te lo cancelé
Si no respondo (¡Ja!) el problema va a tocar fondo
Mami, respira hondo mientra' te lo escondo (Eso e' así)
Contigo obliga'o hoy yo me pongo el condón
Pero postea'o a media cancha, baby, como Rondón (¡Ja!)
Yo a ti te di una sepultura dura (Eso e' así)
Yo sé que con el tiempo la herida se cura (Por ley)
E' que en verdá' que tú no está' a esa altura (¡Ja!)
Te lo juro por Dio' aunque por Dio' no se jura (¡Ra-ta-ta-tá!)

[Estribillo: Darell & Nio García]
Bebé, yo te boté (E' que bebé yo te boté)
Te di banda y te solté (Te di banda y te solté; pa' que sepa')

De mi vida te saqué, eh, eh (Esta es la verdadera vuelta; Real G4 Life, my nigga, ¡huh!)

[Verso 3: Casper Mágico]
(Nosotro' somos Los Mágicos, bebé; ¡Casper!)
Pa'l carajo te boté (Pa'l carajo te boté; ¡wouh!)
Yo sin ti me siento bien (Yo sin ti me siento bien; ah)
Ya no sufro por amore', ahora rompo corazone'
Y sobran las paca' de cien (Las paca' de cien)
Tú me rompiste el corazón (Tú me rompiste el corazón; ¡wuh!)
Sin sentido y sin razón (Sin sentido y sin razón; ah)
Pero tengo un culo nuevo que me da mucho cariño
Y me chinga bien cabrón (Bien cabrón)

[Estribillo: Casper Mágico]
No te lo vo'a negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal
Pero te superé y de mi vida te boté (Yo te boté)
Y te di banda y te solté (Y te solté)
Y de ti no quiero saber (Quiero saber)
Y pa'l carajo te mandé, hoy me voy a beber (Me voy a beber)

[Verso 4: Ozuna]
Ozuna
De mi vida te boté y yo sé que no ere' cualquiera
Me pasaré la vida entera preguntando a dónde fue
Pero tu amiga me textea siempre que ella me desea
Se tira una foto conmigo y me dice: ""Pa' que tú la veas""

[Refrán: Ozuna]
Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, tus beso', tu cuerpo, tus gemido' (Oh)
Lo hacíamo' en el carro, me gritaba al oído
Cierro los ojo' y pienso en todo lo que hicimo', baby (Oh-oh, baby)
Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, tus beso', tu cuerpo, tus gemido' (Oh-oh)
Lo hacíamo' en el carro, me gritaba al oído
Cierro los ojo' y pienso en todo lo que hicimo', baby (Oh)

[Verso 5: Nio García]
¡Nio!
Yo te di confianza y me fallaste
Te burlaste de mí y me humillaste
Lejo' de aquí te fuiste y ni explicaste
Viste mi película y viraste
¿Ahora quiere' saber lo que pienso de ti?
Me siento cabrón porque no estás aquí
Así como viniste tú te puedes ir (Te puedes ir; ¡uh-yeh!)

[Estribillo: Nio García]
No te voy a negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal
Pero me superé y de mi vida te boté, y te boté
Te di banda y te solté, yo te solté
Pa'l carajo te mandé, yo te mandé
Y de mi vida te saqué, yo te saqué
Bebé, yo te boté

[Verso 6: Nicky Jam]
Miento si digo que no me hace falta cuando me rozaba tu piel
(Rozaba tu piel)
Miento si digo que no me hace falta que llames al amanecer
(Al amanecer)
Pidiéndome que te agarre bien duro en la cama y te haga mi mujer
(Te haga mi mujer)
Aprovecho el remix con Ozu' para mandarte pa'l carajo también
(Carajo también)

[Puente: Nicky Jam]
No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad
Me voy pa' la calle esta noche a rumbear
Me bebo dos trago' y te voy a olvidar

No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad
Me voy pa' la calle esta noche a rumbear

254,Out Last Night,"[Verse 1]
We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

[Verse 2]
Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

[Bridge]
Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

[Chorus 3]
Oh, We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight
When we went out last night",Kenny Chesney,2009,"[92, 83, 82, 75, 67, 55, 56, 45, 33, 25, 22, 17, 16, 60, 64, 65, 74, 77, 84, 100]",20

Confidence is a must

People are looking at us

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down

Standin' in the light of your halo

And she’s an actress (Actress), but she ain’t got no need
She’s got money from her parents in a trust fund back East
T—t—t—tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl’s teeth

Xs on the back of your hands
Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands
And the setlist (Setlist) you stole off the stage

Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm
And the best is (Best is), no one knows who you are

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter

And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

A shame that every time you hear my name

It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy
And I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Walk into the room with my skirt tucked into my shoes (my shoes)
I skated here, I'm sweating, had a good day how about you (it was alright)
Let's talk about things, Dan, game plan
Hey Stan, why you talking over me? (ah)
Chatting shit, I'm not a kid, well this is patronizing
Then explain how you studied this at Uni so you'd know (mhm)
More than me about the thing that paid for my phone (yeah)
Why don't you make it a hat trick and comment on my look
Like ""Bit outlandish, love, but you know, don't judge a book""
(Don't judge it)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't know who you think I am
But your bitch is not one
I'm good at what I do
And don't ever let anyone
Tell me that your song's okay
But sweetie did you know
A couple changes here and there would make it super cool
(It would be so awesome, like so much better)

[Chorus]
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate

And I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Don't you think she'd look a little bit nicer if she combed her hair every once in a while, aha
Look at those jeans, so messy, jeez
You know what, her natural hair colour would look so much better on her with her bone structure
She probably doesn't even write her own songs, hahahaha
Open up my mouth and rap some fiction poems prose
But all that you can focus on is my makeup and clothes
I don't have perfect skin, I don't live in fairytale land (La la la)
Stop telling me to grow some balls, I'm happy as a woman

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Also on that subject maybe you should change your look
Your presentation's scruffy and it's time you really took
This whole thing seriously, do you really want success?
Just cause I'm a girl I think that you think you know best
(Well let's be honest, I do)

I was in all them hours in it

Prime prime time of my life witcha
Puttin' prime numbers up though
On them 777 flights witcha
Take a shower with it, gotta cleanse it
Keep the safety off innit
Now we finna have a mini
Outta wedlock, God forgive it
Then forget it
'Cause only God can forget it
All this hotel living
Might as well pay the mortgage what I'm spending
Said the dick long as a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then
Fell asleep in the foreign

Let the LED roll, deer hunter
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the bickets out next week
On me on, my partners

273,I Do Not Hook Up,"[Verse 1]
Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down
You got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you found it
Slow motion sparks, you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Verse 2]
I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last, but this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase, but you're chasing your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say...

'Cause I feel the distance
Between us
Could be over with a snap of your finger

274,Daylight,"[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate

Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night

276,That's Not My Name,"[Verse 1: Katie White]
Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue
And I, I keep stalling, not keeping me together
People around got to find something to say now
Holding back, every day the same
Don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
So with nothing to consider, they forget my name

[Chorus 1]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring

So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not

With everything considered, they forget my name

Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
And though I realize
I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing binding

'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!
(That's just one bum you should've told)
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye (Know you fucked this up!), bye
(And I'ma call you from the Grammies, too!)
Goodbye! (Hopefully you pick up, so I can tell you again)

280,Digital Girl,"[Intro: The Dream]
Yeah, girl, you so sexy though
As she just lay at your feet

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna see what's under there, there
Now put it in the air
Yeah, load it on my Macbook Air
It's a new form of macking, don't be old fashioned
Update your passion
Only reason why I be iChattin'
Is when it's time for some action
I wanna hit it way, way out like John Paxson
But for now I just gotta watch her practice
Send her a picture so she see it
She says, I-I-I can't believe it
Ohh, she all on me, on me
Ohh, I think she want me, want me
I think she showed her homies
Why? Cause all the homies on me
Ayo, all the digital gonna have to do for now
But I'mma break it down when I get back in town

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes, oh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
I love you, girl, girl
You look right in the screen and take it off, off
See I can't wait till I get a little taste of you
And I just upgraded to 10-80i, hi def just for you

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
My homies never seen you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I'll type you a message for the next send off
You shoot me a video and then I load
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind, shawty
Hey, don't care what you wear
Baby, I wanna see what's under there

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
When you seen the picture cut off the face
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC search till I reach third base
And when I get home I'mma hit home plate
Wait, would this be considered our first date?
Yay, this picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And pose in the mag like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian and be a lady addict
You know what's a crazy thing?
A girl would make you wait longer than AC Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty three year old virgin
That's disrespectful, baby, don't encourage him
I like them brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby, you up, question mark
And she reply YES-S-S-I-R

Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me (Ha, look)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I be bangin' all on that beat
808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see
A-A-All that ass, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, this liquor, 'bout to penetrate
While I'm pushin' Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-dick her, I'ma go for hours
You minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as fuck in these Margielas
I skate past, a nigga better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine
My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, bitch nervous
Better ride this wave, bitch, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
Only thing you close is these curtains
And she only got time for a nigga if I take her out to eat
A nigga really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the pussy
I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate
Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Ha, bitch, I ain't got time to play
I need it now, not a minute late, ha

While you kissing your girlfriends

Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Bow your head to a king, nigga
Dreams house, my dreams bigger
Got a deck of cards if my heart switch up
Ace of Spades, her eyes lit up
Diamonds glitter in my car, thriller
She pray for me, that's God willin'
I'm hard to break, my bars prison
Her new name, Ass-Zilla
She love a nigga and that pussy tight
Come through, fuck you all night
Some foreplay, that's all right
But she'd rather do number 69
High notes, it's prime time
On a couch, hit it from behind
Hit you with that large stroke
Now she fiendin' for that good dope, yeah
Ha, that's my bae, she cook and clean, I got it made
Handcuff like she a slave
Touch ya, let your tongue taste
So high, no ceilin' space
Numb to it, can't feel her face
Yeah, she numb to it, can't feel her face

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
Girl, you know we (Yeah)
Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing? (I know)

Girl, I wanna kiss it (I wanna kiss it right there)
While you kissing your girlfriends (Oh-whoa)
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory (I bet I—)
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Blowin' up the line on my cellular
She wanna lock a nigga down on the regular
Talkin' crazy to me like she own the dick
But I don't trust her as far as I can throw the bitch, ha
Momma told me to find a keeper
But I switch like designer sneakers
A girl with the finest features
Every nigga wanna talk to her but I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back is my theme music
Her ass on my mind, I dream booty
Any nigga tryna fuck my bitch
Then it's off with his head, how kings do it
My rings ruby
Red bandana, I stay woopin'
Got too many cribs, I stay movin'
Three Lambos, I stay coupin'
Ha, but you don't hear me though
Virginia to the Westside
Car foreign, the girl sit on the left side
Smokin' weed on the plane, that's the best high
She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly
Helipad on the boat
Chillin' in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco
But nothin' compare to what's in my pants
Girl, stop playin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
Oh-oh, babe
Girl, you know we got the time (We go the time, so later on, what are we doing?)
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing? (Oh-oh)
I know you're ready, show that ass (Getting horny, babe)
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it (I wanna lick, lick, lick right there, right there)

Sometimes to make sure I'm not in a dream

And here I am
I want to be your everything
There you are
Turning winter into spring

And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah
I just call you mine

I fall apart
And just a word from you
Somehow seems to fix
Whatever's wrong

You got to know

That you're more than I deserve

A couple of grands, I got rubberbands
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage

I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya
Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur ('cause)

She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

[Verse 2]
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife

When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

290,Kiss A Girl,"[Intro]
To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 1]
It's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 2]
'Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? Are you ready..to cross that line, put your lips on mine??
(Put your lips on mine baby)
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Verse 3]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

You were looking at me like you wanted to stay
When I saw you yesterday
I'm not wasting your time, I'm not playing no games

Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
'Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go

There's so much we can't explain
Maybe we're helping each other escape
I'm with you

[Chorus]
Know your enemy

Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we, move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in

Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The ""land of the free?""
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system

Is there anybody up here?
Hello?
Welcome...2085. Twenty eighty-five it is
Just me up here I guess

The magic of the moment snuck up on me
And caught me by surprise
Roamin' and I'm lonely
But I'm only
There's somethin in your eyes
And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink

But whatever it might be

That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know that it's true
Baby you got me walkin' on the moon

Aye aye Dream I'm too good at this
Uhh, uhh, uhh, I can't contain it
No, no, no I can't restrain it
There's a lot of stars in here ain't it?
But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear God must have made lightning strike
And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin', they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin'
Like its all about you
Like I can't spend another minute without you
You know the drinks let you say things you ain't allowed to
Things that you fear, but you're way to proud to
Say out loud
Cause niggas gonna clown you
Put your Blackberry down
People is around you
I'll put my mack berry down
I ain't tryin to hound you
Just tryin' to take you where the stars gonna surround you
And Uhmm, maybe ice down you
And Uhmm, maybe white gown you
And Uhmm, maybe we should talk about all this after I pound you
Ha, you know I'm just playin' with you
I know a lot of people mad cause they ain't with you
Wait is it because we on the moon
Tell 'em to save the hate we'll be home soon

295,Too Many Rappers,"[Intro - Nas]
Mic check, mic check

[Hook - Nas] (Beastie Boys)
One (one), two (two), three (three)
Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs
It goes three (three), two (two), one (one)
MCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done
Like ladies and gents, attention
Nas in the house with Beastie Boys
We can turn it out
Perpetrators, we can point 'em out
So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out

[MCA]
Yo, I been in the game since before you was born
I might still be MCing even after you're gone
Strange thought, I know, but my skills still grow
The 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so
On and on until the crack of dawn
Until the year 3000 and beyond
Stay up all night, and I MC and never die
Cause death is the cousin of sleep

[Ad-Rock]
Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie
Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie
Oh my God, just look at me
Grandpa been rappin' since '83
I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad
Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag
Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad
All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs

[Nas]
I have carte blanche, the vagabond
Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund
I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a
You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer
A slug peeler, you're not
Mafioso, no
You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner
I ain't tryin' to hear your racket
You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat
You wear that jacket

[Mike D]
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in mojitos
Bullets and banditos
Matzoh balls in soup
Jackets and troop
Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books
Nasty Nas, what's the word?
Count it off on the hook

[Hook]

[MCA]
Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain
To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister
So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to
Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records
My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack

[Ad-Rock]
To all you crab rappers and hackers
And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda
I take the cake, I stole the mold
The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold
And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?
Sniffin', buffin', huffin'
And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin
Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Nas]
I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway
Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day
I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay
And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this
By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers
I hear Russian blonde's the wettest
But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas
And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?

[Mike D]
Mike D, the man of mystery
History in the makin', and now we're takin'
Titles, awards, and accolades
Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases
Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars
Go back in time, send a fax from my car

[Hook]",Beastie Boys,2009,[93],1
296,Beautiful,"[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

I look for peace but see I don't attain

He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade

The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nike's
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

Money ain't a thing if it ain't throwin' it up in the sky
Hold your drinks up high

If you lookin' like a model
When them broke fellas holla tell 'em bye
Hold your drinks up high

299,Gives You Hell,"[Verse 1]
I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

[Verse 2]
Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

[Pre-Chorus]
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Yeah, where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell

Now you'll never see
What you've done to me
You can take back your memories
They're no good to me
And here's all your lies
You can't look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

(But you never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well

302,Sugar,"[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 1: Wonder Mike]
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song

[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank]
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what?)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
Uh Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

[Verse 3: Master Gee]
Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock rock y'all get on the floor

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Post-Hook: Master Gee]
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor
Uh, come alive, y'all gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop

Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 4: Wonder Mike]
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America: we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast
Rock it up, uh, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie the bang bang the boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 5: Wonder Mike]
I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, uh, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong

[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said ""damn fly guy I'm in love with you""
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said ""I go by the name of Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 7: Master Gee]
It was 12 o'clock one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cutting the jams and making it free
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doing a do
Rocking ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like

[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says ""momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull""
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""man there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby but bubbah we're still friends""

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
With a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Post-Hook: Wonder Mike]
I say ""Hank can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo""
I said ""come on, make uh, make the people move""

[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said ""sit down punk I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker emcees try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a godd--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker emcees can bite all night
Uh, tick a tock y'all, a beat, beat y'all
A lets rock y'all, ya don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
A like that y'all to the beat y'all
A beat, beat y'all ya don't stop
Uh, Master Gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do?

[Verse 10: Master Gee]
Well like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the  Bar-Kays singing 'Holy Ghost'
The sounds to throw down they're played the most
Just like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, uh, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the barkays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doing the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was uh, picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven
Dontcha know I went off
I got right on down to the beat you see
Getting right on down making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat, beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was, uh,  really great
Cause every night you see I had a date
At the age of nine I was, uh, right on time
Cause every night I had a part to rhyme
Going on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A saying on and on and on on and on
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
Call me the master gee you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

Ah, Mister Secretary

[HAMILTON]
Mister Burr, sir

[BURR]
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?

[HAMILTON]
No

[BURR]
You know Clermont Street?

[HAMILTON]
Yeah

[BURR]
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure

[HAMILTON]
Sure

[BURR]
And all he had to do was die

[HAMILTON]
That’s a lot less work

[BURR]
We oughta give it a try

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan through?

[HAMILTON]
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you

[BURR]
Really?

[HAMILTON]
“Talk less. Smile more.”

[BURR]
Ha

[HAMILTON]
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor

[BURR]
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.

[HAMILTON]
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner

[MADISON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go

[BURR]
But—

[HAMILTON]
Decisions are happening over dinner

[BURR]
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
Diametric’ly opposed, foes

[BURR]
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
Previously closed

[ENSEMBLE]
Bros

BURR
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation’s capital
And here’s the pièce de résistance:

[BURR & ENSEMBLE]
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
The room where it happened
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
No one really knows how the game is played (Game is played)
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made (How the sausage gets made)
We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in
The room where it happens. (The room where it happens.)

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claims—

[JEFFERSON]
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day
In distress ‘n disarray

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claims—

[JEFFERSON]
Alexander said—

[HAMILTON]
I’ve nowhere else to turn!

[JEFFERSON]
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claims—

[JEFFERSON]
I approached Madison and said—
“I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he has to say.”

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claims—

[JEFFERSON]
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

[BURR]
But!
No one else was in—

[BURR AND COMPANY]
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

[BURR]
No one else was in—

No one really knows how the
Parties get to yesssss (Parties get to yesssss)
The pieces that are sacrificed in (Ev’ry game of chesssss)
Ev’ry game of chesssss
We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in (The room where it happens)
The room where it happens

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Meanwhile—

[BURR]
Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee

[COMPANY]
Meanwhile—

[BURR]
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—

Company screams in chaos

[BURR]
It isn’t pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

[MADISON]
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words—

[JEFFERSON]
Oh-ho!

[MADISON]
A quid pro quo

[JEFFERSON]
I suppose

[MADISON]
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home?

[JEFFERSON]
Actually, I would

[MADISON]
Well, I propose the Potomac

[JEFFERSON]
And you’ll provide him his votes?

[MADISON]
Well, we’ll see how it goes

[JEFFERSON]
Let’s go

[BURR]
No!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
In God we trust
But we’ll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened

[BURR]
And no one else was in the room where it happened

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

[HAMILTON]
Cuz we’ll have the banks
We’re in the same spot

[BURR]
You got more than you gave

[HAMILTON]
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don’t get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

I wanna build
Something that’s gonna
Outlive me

Hold your nose and close your eyes

We want our leaders to save the day—

[BURR]

We dream of a brand new start—

Hey you, is there something worth aspiring to?
And can it be found in a record store?
Well, it's not there anymore
Just think of all the things we did
We were different, just like all the other kids

[Verse 2]
Missy was a teen blue video star
Tom took his life in his mother's car
Milo went to college, but you knew about that
Rodney played our records, Jimmy started riots
Laurie was always quiet
She was battling depression

[Chorus]
Hey you, is there something worth belonging to?
And can I pick it up for a song or a diploma or a worthy cause?
Well, let me tell you that there's nothing wrong
It's just that ones like us will never belong

[Verse 3]
Jack wore a skirt but he knew how to scrap
Billy went to county on a class-one possession
Wendy went to school while her daddy shot smack
Eugine kept a list, Mugger was security
Mary she kept her purity
We were all in it together

[Bridge]
Yellowed postcards on the wall
Serve to cover up the blankness after all
So I will carry them along like a song
When I'm gone

[Chorus]
Hey you, is there something worth belonging to?
You know we've been here all along like a confederacy of the wrong
And I confess it could be prejudice
But to you I dedicate this song",Bad Religion,2009,[95],1

Could be the love of lifestyle, rhyme or coin
But whether I'm here to light, write or buy the joint
The fuck you sweating on my final choice
Aussie rules baby, fact is, my goals is beside the point
You dig? I'm deep, they shovel you shit by the week
We speak, we mean something, they sheep, they just bleat
The chase and foreverlutionaries link
We steady the ship, these motherfuckers look ready to sink
And elsewhere, i'll see that they dealt fair

There's plenty of half wits that are more popular
But ain't too many artists that could open up your oculars
Yo what it is
Went from anonymous to eponymous to bombing shit
To this posish where ain't nobody stopping us
All aboard the rocket ship
I'm taking y'all to outer space
I display astounding grace while haters eating sour grapes
This is for my people feeling out of place
I'm working on another album mate so grab your calendar and count the days
Time's ticking on simpleton rhyme spitters
The wickedest bi-linguist my lyrics worth five figures
Some people think that it's hard to define brilliance
But I find the definition reflected in my mirror
Don't mean to brag and boast
But we're ripping the maddest quotes
The difference 'tween a panadol and sniffing on a gram of coke
Consider this the antidote to the anti-dope
Kicking cannon balls at ya cantaloupe now adios yo I'm a ghost

Up and at 'em, my body nothing but a vessel
Use to wonder what would happen
Once the dust had come to settle
But for now I'll probably down a couple red bulls
Help a brother butter up his mental
And rush in another schedule
I'm running amongst the madness, rusty has-beens
Asking ""who's that fucker Tuka? Snatchy, he raps in funny accents""
Wants some monkey magic
Suck on my banana
While I fly on carpets
Munging cactus with my pack of mayan shamans
Lion hearted, enlighten darknesss, my mind is universal
Catch me chatting with tiny martians
In hybrid human circles, my life's a music journal
Inspired by buddha sticks and stupid shit
I'm kinda quirky, like a stanley kubrick flick
(The voice of god) I join the dots
Like manuva and tuna fish, who is it?
Holler at your boy, get in tune with it
Dropped it like it's nuclear, I'm getting suited up

313,Shining Down,"[Intro: Matthew Santos]
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky (sky sky)

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Well, well, is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns, a little altered
Your attention, put back on the flow like the department of water
Taking off with the dough, like Little Walter
Chess, yes, baby, I’m Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with the lawyer
Judge, jury, like a loop
Rap name Lupe, but my daddy named me warrior
This is his memorial, shoot

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
No, I ain’t that nigga trying to get a liquor line
When I be scripting lines, want this petition signed
It says I’m sick of dyin', sick of this prison time
I really love my people, I’m sick of pimping mine
Now if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed fat bitch
Telling us not to pursue it, just to shoe it like a blacksmith
We’re trapped, and moving round in circles like it’s Chapstick
And that’s the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
We’ll wrap this around your head
Like the bandanas Fabolous used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in FEDS instead of National Geographics
Well, I’m not having it, nawwww

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain’t never heard mine
And if you have, then you know you ain’t never heard lying
Lu don’t moo, no, cow-ards, you only heard lines
Not a facade cherisher, I’d rather have the scars
I don’t idolize America, I’m dancing with the stars
Uh-huh, all of them? Yeah, they are, too
You look up and you see us shining down on you

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Outro: Matthew Santos]
Shining down on you
Shining down on you

315,Lost You Anyway,"[Verse 1]
Maybe you were right, maybe I could have changed
Sitting here alone tonight thinking 'bout a lot of things
What's a man to say when all the questions start
Hell I know deep down inside my broken heart

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

[Verse 2]
I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now
Nothing I can say to you, you even care to talk about
How you going to dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason, without rhyme
Lovely, sweet young woman
Daughter, wife and mother
Makes no sense to me
I just have to believe

By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

Loved ones she left behind
Just tryin' to survive
And understand the why
Feelin' so lost inside
Anger shot straight at God
Then askin' for His love
Empty with disbelief
Just hopin' that maybe

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'

Her picture in my mind
Will always be of times I'll cherish
And I won't cry 'cause

Girl I guarantee I can make you go numb numb numb numb numb
I got enough bread to take me and you to London
And back to America and all over the country
She make me want to keep her close by like a side kick

There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll find
Should have known better, yeah

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool

[Post-Chorus]
Never without your love

[Bridge]
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm

It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet

And people came from miles around just to help their neighbours out

326,Funny The Way It Is,"[Verse 1]
Lying in the park on a beautiful day
Sun shine on the grass and the children play
Siren’s passing, fire engine's red
Someone’s house is burning down on a day like this

The evening comes and we’re hanging out
On the front step and a car rolls by with the windows rolled down
And that War song is playing, “Why Can’t We Be Friends?”
Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs

[Chorus 1]
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
Somebody’s going hungry and someone else is eating out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody’s heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song

[Verse 3]
The way your mouth feels in a lover's kiss
Like a pretty bird on a breeze or water to a fish
A bomb blast brings the building crashing to the floor
Hear the laughter while the children play war

[Chorus 2]
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier’s last breath, his baby’s being born

[Bridge]
Standing on the bridge, watch the water passing under me
It must’ve been much harder when there was no bridge, just water
Now the world is small, remember how it used to be
With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars

[Breakdown]
Watch the sky in a jet plane, so far out of my reach
Is there someone up there looking down on me?
Boy chase a bird, so close but every time
He’ll never catch her, but he can’t stop trying

[Chorus 3]
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
On a soldier’s last breath his baby’s being born
Funny the way it is, not right or wrong
Somebody’s broken heart becomes your favorite song
Funny the way it is, and if you think about it
One kid walks ten miles to school, another’s dropping out

Ayy, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit, man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)

Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make

It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone

Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin

Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch

Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

Uh huh, ge-ge ge-ge-geah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah, (Brooklyn)
How real is, this?
How real is, this? (Brooklyn)
Uh-huh huh  (Brooklyn)
Respect this here, check!

[Verse 1]
I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come
You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer
When the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets
So I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check
I'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much
And girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much
So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it
I'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about
Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas?
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all

[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 2]
I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas been praying to God so long that they atheist
Where you can't put your vest away
And say you'll wear it tomorrow
'Cause the day after we'll be saying
""Damn, I was just with him yesterday""
I'm a block away from hell
Not enough shots away from stray shells
An ounce away from a triple beam
Still using a hand-held weight scale
You're laughing, you know the place well
Where the liquor stores and the base dwell
And government? Fuck government! Niggas politick theyselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, God strike me
And I got a question:
Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know
One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know
The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 3]
Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the street, twisted off leek
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether you're four-feet or Manute size, it always starts out with
Three dice and ""shoot the five""
Niggas thought they deuce was live, then I hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa, forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs
Before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood
Where I'm from

[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothin's on the radio
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
She usually comes right in, now I can tell

Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

[Verse 2]
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way

340,On The Ocean,"[Verse 1: Glen Phillips]
We spotted the ocean at the head of the trail
Where are we going so far away?
And somebody told me that this is the place
Where everything's better, everything's safe

[Chorus: Todd Nichols and Dean Dinning]
Walk on the ocean
Step on the stones
Flesh becomes water
Wood becomes bone

[Verse 2: Glen Phillips]
And half an hour later, we packed up our things
We said we'd send letters and all of those little things
And they knew we were lying, but they smiled just the same
It seemed they'd already forgotten we'd came

[Chorus, 2x: Todd, Dean and Glen]

[Verse 3: Glen Phillips]
Now back at the homestead, where the air makes you choke
People don't know you and trust is a joke
We don't even have pictures, just memories to hold
That grow sweeter each season as we slowly grow old

341,I Told You So,"[Verse 1: Amy]
Ay, ay, ay
Is it time? Green light
Egotistic battle cry
I was right, you was wrong
Called you out, finished strong
Whiskey sour lemonade
Fences up my barricade
I had heart, you had spades
I could see the color in your face as it fades
And that's how it is, ain't no riddle
Crunchy on the edge but soft in the middle (middle)
I got a lot, you got a little
I'mma play war drums, you play the fiddle
Play it real slow, lean on the bow

Lost your control, I'm on a roll

Fa-fa-fa
Feels so good, doesn't it?
Winnin' while they flubbin' it
I was right, you was wrong
Figured I'd write it in a hip hop song
Was it so hard to believe
I can make it bein' me?
Drank too much ouzo
My gosh, you know
People say a lot of things, make you feel real small
Push them out the way, iced latte tall
I don't really care, I'm already there
Caffeinated up to my eyes, I swear
I'm on the top, you on the flop
Going so long, and I'm never gonna stop
Lost your control, I'm on a roll

You can get it if you ask for it
Put it in the middle finger of the fat ladies singing out
Shatter every glass house, ni hao (oops, uh, ha!)
Meanwhile, I smile (oh? ooh)
Then I go animal style (ooh!)
I be racking up another million
Making me another killin' superwoman on the top dollar bill
And yeah, I muster up a lot of feelings
Tell me what you really think about it
Kidding, I don't even care
Nobody listens to a full gold-coated hater
Be a baller, not a traitor
Please, got me on my knees
Talk to you later, na-na-na-na

Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever, when you feel you’ve lost your way
And what if my chances are already gone?

But you give me one good reason
To fight and never walk away

So here I am still holdin' on

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe

Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries

I fought to the limit to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets?
Don't know where the future's heading

I've risked being safe, but I always knew why
I always knew why

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off

Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on

Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun

Victorious, yeah we warriors

Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure, either let the Feds catch ya (Yeah)
I'm amazing, born on a full moon
I was bred to get it in, no spoon

Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause""

352,Always The Love Songs,"[Verse 1]
We used to pull off Highway 249
Had a cool little place where we'd go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Somebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do ""Ramblin' Man"", ""Proud Mary"", and ""American Band""
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Verse 2]
There was always a line that stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin' of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart, you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin' songs, we could do 'em all night long
But the ones we remember most

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Bridge]
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs
Always the love songs, always the love songs",Eli Young Band,2009,"[89, 81, 69, 71, 79, 83, 90, 95, 94, 100, 97]",11
353,Ain't No Sunshine,"[Verse 1]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away

[Verse 2]
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away

[Verse 3]
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know

Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone

[Verse 4]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away

I never ever, I never ever meant to catch you in a lie
You never ever, you never ever had the heart to say it right

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Margin & Sarah Aarons]
With my phone turned off, it makes no sound
But you said you needed space
'Cause your phone's turned off, I come around
'Cause I just need to say

[Chorus: Both]
I swear I never ever, but that's just what you do
When you love somebody, love someone
I could try to make it better, but that's just how it is
When you hurt somebody, love someone

[Verse 2: Sam Margin & Sarah Aarons]
But I like you better from afar
I think we're better off apart
You called it payback
You only say that with my brother in your bed
You think you're clever
Would I be better fucking someone else instead?

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Margin & Sarah Aarons]
With my phone turned off, it makes no sound
But I still hear your voice
'Cause you're so turned off, I come around
'Cause you leave me no choice

I swear I never ever, but that's just what you do
When you love somebody, love someone
I could try to make it better, but that's just how it is

357,Note To God,"[Hook]
If I wrote a note to God
I'd pour my heart out on each page
I'd ask for war to end
For peace to mend this world
I'd say, I'd say, I'd say
I'd say for all the hate to be swept away
For love to overflow
If I wrote a note to God

[Verse 1: K-Koke]
What would I tell him huh?
I'd tell him 'nough
I'd tell him I've had enough
I'd tell him that I'm mad that I'm bagging up
Why I had to sell grams and let a 'matic bust
Why I had to stick man for they grands and stuff
Why I had to click, bang on a man, and duck
I'm stuck out on the roads with no-one to trust
I'd ask for forgiveness and ask for love
And I'd tell him that it's real out here
I got a princess to think about and feed out here
And they want to leave me dead on the streets, I swear
All this on my head, this shit seems unfair
And I'd tell him that my heart's turned cold
Please forgive me, don't harm my soul
Please guide me through the path I chose
I had no choice because this the life I know

For love to overflow
If I wrote a note to God

[Verse 2: K-Koke]
I'd tell him that I'm sorry, please make space for me
Because in my dreams I'm seeing wreaths with my name on it
Memories of my queen, her Dad's promise
Is that horrid?
I'd tell him that I'm mad from it
It's killing me, secretly, if I am modest
Recently, I can't sleep, if I am honest
They're testing me, they want to see if I am on it
And I'd tell him that I love my Mum
And if it's beef on the road then I bust my gun
It's peak on the roads, you get loved by some
Hated by most, the good die young
And I'd tell him that I ain't never been scared
See the look in my eyes, they will never see fear
Take a look at my life, see, the devil's been here
And fight to the death? I'm forever prepared

Oh and just like the river I've been running ever since

[Chorus]
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

I go to the movie, and I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me ""don't hang around""

[Chorus]
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will

[Verse 4]
Then I go to my brother, and I say, ""brother, help me please""
But he winds up knockin' me back down on my knees
Lor’, there been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on

But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will",Sam Cooke,2009,[56],1

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move

""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead""
""Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I'll bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course unless you object""
""Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head""

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 2]
""Did you get him?"" Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
Shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 3]
Don't you know what felch means? (""Yeah"") Well then, tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
""Shady, what the fuck you saying?"" I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting
""Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being""
No, Dad, I said no — I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it ""Pubic Hair on Chelsea""
""Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene""

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane",Eminem,2009,[85],1

All the more for that

And warred with yourself

Far from bein' shallow 'cause she caught me with a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby that'll take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid
So we back to playin' tennis, meanin' goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore, so I tried to enter raw
Conscience intervenes, concentratin' on my cream
I'm the king, make a move, pawns all the way to Queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO, which means that I profit off of me
All white tees, still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school, 'cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin' free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
If it's not on Maybach, really who the hell cares?
My money long, my nigga, my money strong
If you ain't gettin' money that mean you done somethin' wrong

Down to all of my automobiles, with no miles
Yellow Corvettes, black rally stripes
And I never phone ahead, all she do is hear the pipes
Project bitches, upscale kittens
Fuck her for a minute, that night we countin' digits
Maybach money so I always had a vision
I would always tell my niggas but, ain't nobody listened
Words work magic, haters wreak havoc
Ain't nothin' on my back but the delicates of fabrics
I made a transition from the thieves
To the biggest executive Def Jam's ever seen
Lyor's dream, Sean John suit
And a S. Dot ring, Chandon for my crew
Bad hoes in pursuit, Masspike on a two
Gunplay he a glue, goon with an attitude, holla

Allan Zamren on the case so you know what you could suck
Wear red all the time, but really I'm color blind
Wanna catch my attention, nigga? Throw up a dollar sign

This will only last a week or two

Someday soon she will be a teenager
And at times he'll think she hates him
Then he'll walk her down the aisle
And he'll raise her veil
But right now she up and crying
And the truth is that he do not mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows

From N.W.A, from black and the gray
From choking a bitch, to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies, to racking AKs up

And we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none

Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

[Chorus: Eminem]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)

Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

[Verse 6: Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees

[Verse 7: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up, Cheech
Come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady, man, come on back—What?
Man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn, bitches!)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—

[Chorus: Eminem]
Give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)
I said, one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You are now smokin' with the best)",Eminem,2009,"[93, 25]",2

Spinning to the sound
Like a record goin 'round
Must be the music
We could be making out
But all I really want right now
Is just the music
I'm only here to dance
I'm not looking for romance
So watch me work it
I gotta get a fix
Of my daily mega mix
So keep it groovin'

I really didn't mean to turn you on
But you know I like the way you move it
So if you wanna wait for me

I'm diggin on the scene
The music gets the best of me
It's so addictive
No need to save my seat
Cause I'm not gonna miss a beat

But save it for some other time
Right now I'm dancin'
Get rid of my gangster leave
Oh you know what I mean
I wanna do it

I'm just here for the music
I really didn't mean to turn you on
But you know I like the way you move it

And then it comes to me, like an epiphany

Like you always do
I just kiss your cheek
And this is
What I tell you (you, you)

379,Crack A Bottle,"[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

And there's really not that many of us

[Break 1: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 2: Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move

380,Don't Think I Can't Love You,"[Verse 1]
I learned the hard way real early in life
That money sure don't grow on a tree
And there's a few things that a dollar can't buy
The best things in life, they come free

[Chorus]
So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby don't think I can't love you

[Verse 2]
And when I get home after working all day
I'm beat down girl, I'm dead on my feet
But as tired as I am if you want to play
Well, playing sounds real good to me

381,Don't Forget,"[Verse 1]
If I fall, can you pull me up?
Is it true, your watching out
And when I'm tired, do you lay down with me?
In my head so I can sleep without you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey
Without you there's holes in my soul
Hey, hey
Let the water in

[Chorus]
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me
Where ever you've gone?
How, how, how?
I just need to know
That you won't forget about me

Lost through time and that's all I need
So much love, then one day buried
Hope you're safe, cause I lay you leaves
Is there more than we can see?

Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

394,Candle (Sick And Tired),"I took her out on a February morning
Just getting over it and dealing with the mourning
I started thinking out loud
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

My baby's flying off the edge of the rope
She's saying, ""I'm so sorry about that note.""
That left me all alone
But I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me what's wrong
I'd be lying if I told you
Losing you was something I could handle

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me how long
All this darkness will surround you
'Cause I'm burning for you
Burning like a candle

Seven days since I've seen your face
Seven nights I have laid to waste
I'm burning out now
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired

I know we're hanging at the end of the road
We've flown too high, baby, swum too low
I heard her screaming out loud
I heard her screaming out loud

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me what's wrong
I'd be lying if I told you
Losing you was something I could handle

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me how long
All this darkness will surround you
'Cause I'm burning for you
Burning like a candle

Baby, baby, baby
All the things that you say
What are the things that you mean?
What are the things that you say, say, say to me?

'Cause you're a tragedy
A queen for his majesty
All these plans for me
Your kingdom is crumbling

You're a tragedy

395,Butterfly Fly Away,"[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could been
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus + Billy Ray Cyrus]
Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far, but you can always dream
Wish you may, and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly fly away

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus + Billy Ray Cyrus + Both]
Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
Got your wings, now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true

396,Nothin' To Die For,"[Verse 1]
Stopped to have a few at five now you're crossing that center line for the third time
Second time like this this week had a friend ask you for your keys
You said 'no I'm fine'
You sure do act like you don't got a thing to lose
But every car you pass might be the ones you take with you

[Chorus]
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothing to die for

[Verse 2]
So what's the harm in a little fun
'Cause you're off to work before the sun every day
And the inbox outbox locks you in and the money you make ain't worth the time you spend to make your pay
The doctor says 'man your numbers they don't lie'
The graveyard's full of folks that didn't have time to die

[Chorus]
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around
'Cause this ain't nothing to die for

[Verse 3]
Straight through that guardrail up into that white light
You hear a sweet voice saying just this side of the other side
Just this side of the other side

[Chorus]
You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country for your Jesus for your friends
There's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
You've got to fight it somehow, stop and turn around

S.C. initials on the Tiffany glass
I guess on the initial Maybach
I was way too official, they ain't call Jay back
I'm just a bully, I apologize
And if you would've asked, I probably would've lied
Huh, this better, no pressure
As my mind reclines on white leathers
I think back to my first Maybach
Baby blue sides, I called her my Similac
Six-deuce every time, I never had the Heinz

Oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside
On the factory shoes, I won't lose my stride

Suck a Dick Butkus, chumps can't funk with the punk kids
Ash Roth be the king of the blumpkins
Any Tim Duncan, spur of the moment
Let the whole world know I run shit, jump ship quick

Spit fungus that'll grow from a dung, trip
Twist to a front flip, son that was some trick
Watch all the dumb chicks hump when I bump this

Kinda like the blonde Bob Saget, Ash can get nasty
Pass me a blunt and some Captain
Chilling with an Ashley, heading to the mall
Sitting in the backseat, getting jerked off
Ten feet tall with the balls of a matador
Door-matted whore with your words, heard that before
Poor metaphor, pedicure, get your feet fixed
Walk in my shoes for a few, you gonna need it
Yeah, get your Wii Fit to practice your frees with
Need a few weeks before you can compete with
Razor Ramon flow, oh so sharp
You can take Kapowski, I'mma take Lark on my go-kart

Mario Kart skills are outrageous
Play me anyday and I'll be the best racist
Wait, no, erase it, meant to say racer
Traded in my cell phone for a new pager
Take off your Bluetooth now dot com

About thirty five with at least two kids

It’s raining and it’s Monday

My daddy taught me in this country everyone's the same
You work hard for your dollar and you never pass the blame
When it don't go your way
Now I see all these big shots whining on my evening news
About how they're losing billions
And it's up to me and you to come running to the rescue

Well pardon me if I don't shed a tear
Cause they're selling make-believe
And we don't buy that here

[Chorus]
Cause in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down

[Verse 2]
Well that old man's been working in that plant most all his life
Now his pension plan's been cut in half and he can't afford to die
And it's a crying shame, cause he ain't the one to blame

When I look down to see his calloused hands
Well let me tell you friend it gets me fightin' mad

[Chorus]
Because in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus pay and jets on out of town
And DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin' Detroit down

While they're living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town

They can call it one-hit wonder, but I guess that means I'm one-up
Light a match, play with fire, that just means you gon' get burned up
In the river, where you turn up, 'cause they see I'm on the come-up
But it's our, turn, now, if you want it, take it from us
I don't need no goons by me, if you want it come and try me
We can do this broad day, in the middle of the lobby

When they problems turn to prolly and they prolly's turn to sorry

And she's got that body, always gotta flaunt it

Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch

And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break

The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

422,Gotta Be Somebody,"[Verse 1]
This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

[Verse 2]
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end?
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

[Bridge]
Ooh, you can't give up (When you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough ('Cause you never know)
When it shows up (Make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one
The one you're waiting on

[Breakdown]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh

423,God Love Her,"[Verse 1]
Just a girl born in Dixie
Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
About falling in love with a bad boy

Yeah, they could see it all coming
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kind of crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

[Verse 2]
She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone you
She called from a truck stop
In Tucson Arizona
With amazing grace
We made California line
And then my gypsy life
Started taking its toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

[Chorus]
Now she holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

424,Things That Matter,"[Verse]
Sometimes he lets that boss get
In his head
He can't see passed that mountain
Of deadlines on his desk
Five o'clock, he's the last one
Out of the gate
And he gets cut off, flipped off, ticked off
Out on the interstate
And he wonders why this world won't
Leave him alone
Til he hears that little voice holler
Daddy's home

[Chorus]
Things that matter
Things that don't


She's held on to that grudge
All her life
And thirty years of anger
Since her dad walked out that night
She thinks of all the moments
That he's missed
All the birthdays, ballets, first dates
It seems too much to forget
She gets that call that said he
Don't have long
She walks in, he starts crying
The past is gone

[Chorus]
Things that matter
Things that don't

[Bridge]
Time ain't on our side
Don't wanna leave this world
With why didn't I, why didn't I
Yeah, why didn't I
Sometimes I take on this world
By myself
Thinking I got all the answers
Don't need anybody's help
When God was right there waiting
For me all along
To fall down on my knees
Surrender all

[Chorus]
Things that matter, things that don't
Things that matter, things that don't",Rascal Flatts,2009,[85],1

My heart is too heavy for things like this

I had them bringing me up then you come around like this
It's like you left me before
I didn't move a muscle
'Cause baby it's hard to lift
I told you to leave right now
Look past the door and you took my advice
You sped off, you dipped
That old whip your parents could barely afford it
I can't believe that thing is running still, I
Guess it doesn't matter
'Cause you never see me anymore, aye
You left kisses on my neck and though I had them
And then I asked you if you ready for it like

Just leave me here
Hoping that if I close my eyes
And wake up and open 'em you would just reappear
Overnight, do you believe in magic baby
Tell me it's Souly I wanna hear

You never get old after all the year
Old after all the year

In gardens all wet with rain

Her Daddy gave her, her first pony
Then taught her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell I don't know how many times
He taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well

Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

[Verse 2]
She grew up
She got married
Never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started coming home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart

Phone rang early one morning
Her momma's voice, she'd been crying
Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said

I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair

But I'm scared of loving you
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task
Why it don't last?
Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?

Sorry if I sound so filled with gloom
You say you care and I know you do
But this is from my experience
And my conclusion only makes sense

Just cause I love you and you love me
It doesn't mean that we're meant to be
I can climb mountains, swim across the seas
But the most frightening thing is you and me

I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears

When love seems to hate us?

Most circumstances, I know my fate
But in this love thing, I don't get the game
Why does it feel like those who give in
They only wind up losing a friend


Just cause I love you and you love me
It doesn't mean that we'll ever be
Fly across the ocean, sing for the queen
But the most frightening thing is you and me

I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears

But I'm scared of loving you

Why it don't last?
Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?

I'm sure, though
I'm not sure
But if we never try, we'll never know
It's better to have loved
Than not to loved at all

Not trying is worse than to stumble and fall
And if we do, I'd rather it be with you
Cause at least there will be sweet memories
Oh, I'm not scared

I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears
(No I'm not)
But I'm scared of loving you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Bridge: Assassin]
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)

We deal with action ting

I'm a badman if you know say

435,You're Not Sorry,"[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey and it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
Cause they don't fucking

[Kanye]
I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast motherfucker!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them

Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and

This is the last call for alcohol, for the

So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now I am

And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them

So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit

And I am

And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with

So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""

[Saxophone Solo]

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""

[JAY-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]

""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""

[JAY-Z: ""so what you think of this?""]

And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Mother: ""Come on, let's just go""]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Mother: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""

[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""

[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]

Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""

[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""

[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]

""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""

443,Chicken Fried,"[Intro]
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love",Zac Brown Band,2009,"[50, 43, 43, 45, 42, 38, 36, 30, 27, 22, 22, 20]",12

Your sex is on fire

Your sex is on fire

445,She Wouldn't Be Gone,"[Verse 1]
Red roadside wildflower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through

Yellow sunset slowly dippin' down in the rearview
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and make her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that, maybe I

[Chorus]
Wouldn't be drivin' like hell flyin' like crazy down the highway
Callin' everyone we know stoppin' any place she might be
Goin' any place she might go beatin' on the dash
Screamin' out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone
She wouldn't be gone

[Verse 2]
She warned me it was comin' said if I didn't change
She was leavin'
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out
God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin', they ain't sayin'
Now, I'm cursin' like a fool, prayin' it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes

[Chorus]
Find her beg her for one more try until then damn it I'll
Be drivin' like hell flyin' like crazy down the highway
Callin' everyone we know stoppin' any place she might be
Goin' any place she might go beatin' on the dash
Screamin' out her name at the windshield tears soakin' up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone

[Verse 3]
I wouldn't be beatin' on the dash
Screamin' out her name at the windshield tears soakin' up my face

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone

Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me

Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

448,Country Boy,"[Verse 1: Aaron Lewis]
Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said, ""You wanna sell a million records, boy? You better listen to me""

[Bridge: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
He said, ""Change your style, whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?""

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
I said, ""no that's not me""
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis]
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive

[Verse 3: Aaron Lewis]
Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made
""Don't tread on me"" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Outro: Charlie Daniels]
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes, 'cause this is America, and a country boy is good enough for me, son",Aaron Lewis,2009,"[92, 94, 84, 82, 71, 59, 51, 49, 55, 59, 70, 57]",12
449,More Like Her,"[Verse]
She's beautiful in her simple little way
She don't have too much to say when she gets mad
She understands; she don't let go of anything
Even when the pain gets really bad
I guess I should've been more like that
You had it all for a pretty little while
And somehow you made me smile when I was sad
You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart
And then you realized you wanted what you had
I guess I should've been more like that

[Chorus]
I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserved
I guess I should've been more like her

[Verse]
Forgiving you
Well, she's stronger than I am
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at
It's plain to see desperation showed it's truth
You love her, and she loves you with all she has
I guess I should've been more like that

[Chorus]
I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserved
I guess I should've been more like her

But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you wherever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you

Well those rumors, they have big teeth

She wants to make every stray a pet

How many niggas is saying they pimping
It's evident when is it none of you niggas got pimp in your blood
All of y'all watered down like a tub full of suds
I cannot fuck with you let me roll up my bud
Girl you look like a dime but can you roll up a dub
Go to the club you said you ain't looking for love
But you dark and lovely and the night was gusting
Marijuana and bubbly now your body I'm lusting
Forever, ever never for the time being
You without clothes is the only thing I'm seeing
Hair swanging you hear what I'm saying
I may be a gook but this time I'm not playing
This conversation was start of creation
Creating a game that was shown to me
Niggas be praising you hoping to play with you
Sorry my dear you're just shone to me

[Hook]
Well it's cool to us if you want to be shown
We'll just blame it on the fact that she just don't know
It's cool cause you are delusional
Cause you know that we know that you are what you are
You're shone

[Verse 2: Twelve'Len]
I respect the ladies
No love for these hoes
Whats the point in fucking bitches
When that shit gets old
Seen it time and time again
The way that you don't know
So I had to switch the game up
It's fuck bitches get dough, ohh
Time for me to settle down
And quit chasing after these skirts
All of these hoes only know what I worth
Yeah I got a girl don't want her to get hurt, mane
Bout to go way back home
Away from the life full of sin
That Billie Jean and a cup of gin
I know you wanna fuck, don't pretend shawty

Well it's cool to us if you want to be shown
We'll just blame it on the fact that she just don't know

Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid

[Verse 1: Akon]
I see police on the crooked I
Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin', blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that motherfuckin' would, ‘cause we're certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make the name off me

I just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (vroom)
Paint look like a sugar free Red Bull
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full
And that's before the taxes
Took my own gross net and hid it under my mattress
Used to get bored and count 20's for practice
Paper therapy we let money relax us
Gold chains around my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water, kill them in the water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said the house too small, I moved an extra block
So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block
I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops; and that's why

For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
Guess what? I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Ha ha, ain't that funny?
‘Cause niggas want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking 'til they start gunning

Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house

We carry choppers on our necks; call it cut throat
We bury cowards on the set that they come from

We bomb first when we ride

Equals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda (Haha!)
And you know how far one drink could go
Start slurring my speech, slowing up the flow
Hiking up your skirts, climbing up your shirts
It's Mr. Late Night Luda, and I like to flirt
So guess what, baby girl!

[Hook: T-Pain & Ludacris]
Yeah, yeah
If I take one more drink (Drink)
I'm gon' end up fucking you (Just one more!)
Is that what you wanna do, shawty?
That's all it's gon' take!
If I take one more drink (Hey!)

Haha! Who else, T-Pain?
You too, ooh, ooh, ooooh

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

[Verse 1]
Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violence prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam

Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say

[Chorus]
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

[Verse 2]
So many wars, settling scores
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
I heard them say 'love is the way'
'Love is the answer,' that's what they say

But look how they treat us, make us believers
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us
Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers

But we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering, when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that faithful day
It's not far away but for now we say

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes
And then it goes

And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger just like a wavin' flag

464,Love Lockdown,"[Produced by Kanye West & Jeff Bhasker]

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]

Would you believe me now if I told you I got caught up in a wave?
Almost gave it away
Would you hear me out if I told you I was terrified for days?
Thought I was gonna break

Oh, I couldn't stop it
Tried to slow it all down
Crying in the bathroom
Had to figure it out
With everyone around me saying
""You must be so happy now""

Oh, if you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
And if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)

[Verse 2]
And do you believe me now that I always had the best intentions, babe?
Always wanted to stay
Can you feel me now that I'm vulnerable in oh-so-many ways?
Oh, and I'll never change

Tried to figure it out
But everything kept moving
And the noise got too loud

467,If I Were A Boy,"[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Verse 2]
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

[Breakdown]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?

And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey

Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin' for, but catch you a great white
Me, I see great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bales?
Who knew what came with jail?
Who knew what came with prison?
Just 'cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a Seminole?
I say, and I quote, ""We need a miracle.""
And I say a miracle 'cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you can be, now don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga Bu
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue

An earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans

Yeah, our history, black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some keys
So a nigga won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a nigga can't go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes strippin'
She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-itician
My president is black, Rose golden charms
22-inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego
We've got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label

They gotta put your face on the 5000 dollar bill

And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on

You think I don't know that you still talk to her
And you told me you were movin on
You just don't want anyone thinking you still care but you still keep them screenshots
And I guess you just loved you more
All your boys told me how you wanted something real but I guess I wasn't good enough

My daddy gon' kill you when he hears this song
He knows that you lied to me, he's glad to see you gone
You're just so messed up in your mind, you cannot see what's inside mine
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
No I don't like, the way, you played me out
Maybe you can go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin on to something
Baby you can go and fuck yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love now I fear nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself

Wassup, boo? Yeah
Hahahaha, yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Another shady mission
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, ‘cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who
Who be the one who be there

No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside

And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one whoooo…

Boy, nigga sipping like parched throat
Ahe-he-hem, excuse me?
These niggas talking that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room's cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feeling on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove, unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse, yes, Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four chicks
Riding with these guns, that's carpooling
Bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow White, we snowed in
Nigga, miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that
And watch everybody I toast wit
Kill everybody you close with
Just don’t stick your nose in my bullshit
Cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with
Will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live
You tell that nigga I owe him, yeah
I got my mind right, my money right
My head on my shoulder

And pop up like new toast
Like, danger taste like glucose
My shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes: kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
AK to your face; knock half off, like coupons
Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys

Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarine and Grenadine, ha!

You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick
She gotta micro manage
I'm just eatin rappers
They go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge

495,At Last,"I was never spellbound by a starry sky
What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
""Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?""

How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa

(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(Yes…) But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaa
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaa
Did you even have any doubt? After Doubt it was over

No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Chuch, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire, I got stripes: Adidas
Mamis scream ""¡Papi, no más!""
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, ‘cause we the only thing to talk about

You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

[Chorus: M.I.A.]

Hands so big, you thought I told, ""Pull it over""
She pulled me over, pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closer, do me in the back of the car

503,Shattered (Turn The Car Around),"In a way, I need a change
From this burnout scene
Another time, another town
Another everything
But it's always back to you

Stumble out, in the night
From the pouring rain
Made the block, sat and thought
There's more I need
It's always back to you

But I'm good without ya
Yeah, I'm good without you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
How many times can I break till I shatter?
Over the line can't define what I'm after
I always turn the car around

Give me a break let me make my own pattern
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered
I always turn the car around

I had no idea that the night
Would take so damn long
Took it out, on the street
While the rain still falls
Push me back to you

But I'm good without ya
Yeah, I'm good without you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]

Give me a break let me make my own pattern
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered
I always turn the car around

Give it up, give it up, baby
Give it up, give it up, now
Now

[Hook]

All that I feel is the realness I'm faking
Taking my time but it's time that I'm wasting

504,Bust Your Windows,"[Verse 1]
I bust the windows out your car
And, no, it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now, I don't care about that part
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna, but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

[Chorus]
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

[Verse 2]
I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with a crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark
I bust the windows out your car
You should feel lucky that was all I did
After 5 whole years of this bullshit
Gave you all of me and you played with it

[Chorus]
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

[Verse 3]
I bust the windows out your car
But it don't compare to my broken heart
You could never feel how I felt that day
Until it happens, baby, you don't know pain
Oh, yeah, I did it. You should know it
I ain't sorry. You deserved it
After what you did to me
You deserved it. I ain't sorry no, no
You broke my heart, so I broke your car
You caused me pain, so I did the same
Even though what you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make you hurt
Oh, but why am I still crying?
Why am I the one who's still crying?
Oh, oh, you really hurt me, baby
You really, really hurt me, baby

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

You are young, and so am I
And this is wrong, but who am I to judge?
You feel like heaven when we touch
I guess for me, this is enough

[Chorus]
We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

You are young and I am scared
You're wise beyond your years, but I don't care

Maybe I'm wrong, you decide
Should've been strong, yeah, I lied
Nobody gets me like you
Couldn't keep hold of you then
How could I know what you meant?
There was nothing to compare to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's a mountain between us
But there's one thing I'm sure of
That I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

All that it takes, one more chance
Don't let our last kiss be our last
I'm out of my mind just to show you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know everything changes
I don't care where it takes us
'Cause I know how I feel about you

[Chorus]
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

[Bridge]
Not a day, pass me by
Not a day, pass me by
When I don't think about you
And there's no moving on
'Cause I know you're the one
And I can't be without you

[Chorus]
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down

Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

509,All Summer Long,"[Intro]
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

[Verse 2]
Catching wild life from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

[Hook]
While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

[Verse 3]
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

512,Pen & Paper (Something Typical),"[Produced by K-Rino]

[Intro: K-Rino]
Aah!
Man naw that's not goin get it man
Gotta come better than this
My head is killing me mayne
AAHHH!

[Verse 1:]
Gazing at this blank page channeling my deep cerebral phase
My mind slowly reaches the ninth stage
Boom! Now I've capture it
The paragraphical map is scrambled in my inner-cranial labyrinth
I'm focused let's go after it
I moved in carefully the canvas stares at me with apathy
And as I struggle it sarcastically talks back to me
Frustration pops in the strain out of classical
Concoction is pain staking but failure's not an option
A spark the size of a quark
Try to take shape and develop into what becomes an embryonic thought
My endorphins releases it and starts chasing it
My cerebellum embraces it but I hasten over-anxiousness just erases it
A split second away from delivering
Was at the edge of my mental but quickly back flip it to the River of Oblivion
I'm almost nauseous why should I be cautious
When all this inanimate garbage is under my auspice
The vision within the smooth black pen
But when the concept begins something pushes it back in
All the inspiration ceases a sharp pain increases
Scattered fragments of a thesis but my mind won't release it
Fighting something not typical to fight with
Stare at the page all night till my sight quit my occipital might split
So scandalous as the virgin canvas
With no regard for the man who try the channel his deepest start to romance it

[Hook: x2]
The Canvas
With great works of art rest
Where created inspiration is made manifest
Philosophies and dreams executed by the hand
Before it's send out to man this is where it all began

[Verse 2:]
(The canvas) as fast as the Atlantic
Where the righteous and the rancid ideas of man sit
The organic And the outlandish
The 3 way connection between my thoughts page and the pen that I brandished
I wrote a line I felt from within (yeah)
The page regurgitated back in the form of a flame that melted my pen
I replace it with one I figured was greater
The first acceptable line finally hits the paper several hours later
I was tired but couldn't rest till I'm thru
The canvas spoke to me again and calmly asked, ""Is that best you can do? ""
I said ""Fool, I got a message for you, (ha ha)
How you gon disrespect my work and all of this time I've invested in you? ""
It said, ""You're full of intellectual wealth
You started this so now you gotta live up to the standard you set for yourself
The unparallel creations the times the innovations
The mixture of real life situations and useful information.""
I asked ""Why do you care? "" it replied
""How can you lyrically stimulate people's minds if you and I don't coincide?
Besides the fact I'm being protective of you
Would you wanna have something written on your body that's not reflective of you? ""
Had to agree that it's perspective was true
So in a second or two I brainstormed and intellectually grew
It was torture and my thoughts were exhausted
I didn't draw a mountain side or a wild orchid but a literary portrait
And what I wrote the page no wonder denounced it
My mind pushed and gave birth to a verse that weigh 3 tons and seven ounces
I asked, ""How do you like it"" It said, ""I love it! ""
Now I know my page will only accept words that are worthy of it

Ooh, look at it! It's so beautiful! So beautiful! What shall we name it?

(We ain't never goin' nowhere)
And the world has turned to silent
(Gonna tell the world we're here)
When the clouds have all departed
(Never, ever departed, oh)
You will be right here with me
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears have dried from cryin'
And the world has turned to silent
When the clouds have all departed
You will be right here with me

I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me

I'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah",Brandy,2009,"[92, 81, 65, 60]",4

We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

Hala sheiki, ha lini falla
Mili ha lan shi inni mala
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Now, there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money in the desert playing golf
Dolce shorts, dashiki with a Louis Scarf
Chest cold, diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai, 20 million on the villa loft
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic!

La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Seven star hotels, Maybach, movie sick
Big bitches, knock-kneed camel-toed groupie shit
Women walk around while security on camelback
Club on fire now, niggas don't know how to act
Sittin' in casinos while I'm gamblin' with Arafat
Money long, watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
Y'all already know, I got the streets buzzin'
While I make you bow down and make Salaat like a Muslim

[Hook: Ron Browz]
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See, now I take trips to Baghdad dummy
While I use stacked chips and count Arab money now
I don't need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke
So much cake even the money look weird too
Domestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right
Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al Saud
They respect the value of my worth in Mali, Malaysia
Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia!

516,When It Hurts,"Even when it hurts (x4)
Would you still put me first, even when it hurts?

Damn, remember when it was jus an idea?
It's kinda crazy how we made it here
All the pain, hard work and blood, sweat and tears
All the Bros that we lost how we wish was here
I don't like suprises, well, I just hate the stares
I know these bitches ain't shit that's why I stay prepared
My ex tried to make me jealous thinking that I cared
Forgetting bout the last bitch that took what was here
Yea, hard for me to really hurt
I wish me & Brit could make it work
See in her mind think I'm puttin other bitches first
I just wonder who she'll fuck once I'm the dirt
See I watched Myiesha and know she really love my brother
He was dead for a year, she found abother lover, damn
You can't control nothin when you gon
And it's only so long now I'm on so enjoy the moment
Ain it crazy how the brain work
Success is nothin wit no pain first
A couple million right now is what my name worth
I love my nigga much it's like we got the same Earth
Watch niggas they in a disguise
Loyalty til the end who in for the ride?
Xanies and nem perks got a nigga fried
It's like Medusa if you ever lookin in my eyes
Closest I'll get to heaven is my kids
Cos I know I gotta answer fa the shit I did
My hands too dirty for Him to forgive
I mean, it is what it is
Don't understand how I'm still blessed
I'm just tryna stop my mother's stress
Take care of the kids and the ones that my brother left
So if you tryna stop that you betta come correct
She like Albee, why I ain meet ya mother yet?
Cos you'll neva last wit the onces my mother met
I used to sneak outside whIle my mother slept
Prolly made a hundred thousand on my mother's steps, yea
Truth be told, that's a truth be told (x2)
She said Albee don't you lie to me
I said I love you girl, honestly
This is how it gotta be
I know you gettin tired uh me
I be getting tired uh me
It hurt to see you cry ta me
How long would you ride for me?
And see me as your prodigy?
Yea I know you love me but love is like a lie to me
So many people lied to me
It took so much up outta me
I'm drained (x2)
And I don't mean ta put you in the same bucket
But how I protect myself and just saying fuck it?
Hypothetically your love is just ahead of me
And I'm just tryna be a better me, me
The same thing that make you laugh could make you cry
The same thing that make you quit could make you try
I see them tears in her eyes
And it hurt me cos I'm the reason why, I'm the reason why
Why I'm still like this
I know love ain 'posed ta feel like this, it make me feel like shit
Maybe it's best for us to separate
How much you really love me? She don't hesitate
Maybe it's best for the both of us
Why you speaking up for both of us?
Albee boy I know wassup
I don't know it all but I know enough
You acting like it ain't no hope for us
And I gave you all of me
You ignoring me like I ain't show enough
Boy you grown but you ain't growing up
I know (x4)
But, this love shit you gotta brace yourself
Cos if anot her person cross me ima hate myself
And you prolly don't wanna hear it
Cursing me out, thinking I'm careless
Thinkin I don't feel shit
But I would DIE FOR YOU THAT'S REAL SHIT
You know all the pain that I dealt with?
The pain I dealt with
All this pain that I dealt with (x2)
Would you still put me first? (x2)
Even when it seems it don't work?
Even when it seems like it won't work?
Would you still put me first?
Even when it hurts...",Albee Al,2009,"[97, 93]",2
517,Universal Mind Control,"[Verse 1]
J-E-double-T-double-U-oh
I got a swagger that'll attract a harajuku
They say they got nothing on you
'Cause I'm out of this world on Mars, where's Bruno
Another beat that I stumbled across
That I felt, so you know I had to double the bars
And I melt, I'm for real, the flow's so uncommon
Feeling like I'm spitting in a puddle for y'all
I be rapping in a muzzle and all, I'm dogging
I be all for it like a couple of paws
With a couple of others from a hundred dogs
I be on my bed sheet no cover at all
I be on my tank ish, no hummer involved
I be on my bank ish, all commas and clauses
Flow wet like salt dissolving
Underwater, but I am far from the solvent
I'm on that uhh uhh
They on that uh oh
And they be on my sour belt like Kool-Aid
'Cause I be stunting like growth nigga
I'm on top of every line like quotes
The only time I cycle is a circle from a donut
V8 engine, supercharged flow
With more horsepower than a fresh dyno, nigga
This be that new shit
That Jet 2  on some cool shit
That Jet 2 want some coochie
Wait, oh, ho! Excuse me
Ha, I'm a cool influence, but sometimes I like it stupid
And like Nike, I just do it
And I act like my mind is loosened
But really the truth is everyone is a college student
So I'm on my scholar too shit
Shit, I could've been a doctor too bitch
But I just choose this
'Cause right now I'm tryna be the coolest
But I ain't even cool, I'm a square that got dipped in some coolant
Ha. She say I'm too big, but really I think what the truth is
That no matter what the size is, when it's inside it's like a toothpick
But I Pac-Div you could've swore I knew the Cool Kids
Could've swore I was in movies how I'm scoring with the music
I'm my new sense, ladies say I'm such a nuisance
And the flow is so translucent like I'm Dr. Seuss' student
Nigga I be on my Clipse Grinding
Hit them holes like Tomlinson
Could've swore I been signed
'Cause that mind control's so Common
Run them skins like Donovan
I be so off topic
But always on top of it even when I'm off top
Yeah, I'm on that uhh uhh
They on that hot pana thing thong
Not a damn near, ni- nada of you mutha fkas hotter than my theme song
Nigga I be seeing sounds, N-E-R-D for real
I eat beats for dinner, could've been a smuck like Steve Carrell
Ahh, Where has Jet 2 been?
Losing all his screws left
Funny thing is I got several left
Yo' girl higher than treble clefs
On that note, I'm icy yo synopsis has been devil breath
I might be so uneven, beat the game 'til there's no level left
I'm on it like eleven, I'm the number one's equivalent
To the sum of six and five, XI
My thoughts are just so prevalent
I'm on that bang thicki thang thi thang ki thang thang
Braw ticki braw thi bang thi bang bang
Raw ticki raw thi bang thi bang bang
Ti ti taw ticki taw thi thang thi thang thang
My sound's galactic, I'm so erratic
But so efficient like spikes on cactus
I'mma park out of space where my ships are validated
I begin where every week ends like Saturday, bih
I'm on my zshurp zshurp
They on that errr bow
I'm on my no recognition shit
They on they ""oh wow, oww""

And I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper

And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money

[Hook 1: Nicki Minaj]
If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold
Now they screaming, ""Nicki leave me alone!"" (Hard)
I am (Hard), I'm still (Hard) the one to beat (Go hard)
Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go-oh
Go hard!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down!)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch buzz me in (BZZZZ!)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh!)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lam-y (O-WAH!)
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good-uh
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you could-uh
I represent all the girls that stood up (Unh!)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two!"")
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm telling LA Reid, to step his bid up
And I'm telling President Carter, he picked a winner,bitches like Nelly and Kelly, got a dilemma
These birds all fly south, in the winter
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
(Aha-uh, aha-uh, aha-uh, ah-ah-ah-ah, aha-uh, aha-uh, aha-uh)
No muuuuz-zlllllle, hahahaha
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen, in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas, wheelying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, Saltfish Ackees
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feeling, kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland, is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed
Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (Gotta get me)

[Hook 2: Nicki Minaj]
If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the choke hold on now
They screaming, ""Nicki leave me alone!""
I am, I will, I gots to win
I’m still looking around for my competition
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go
Go hard!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal; no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fucking with me if you fucking with Nic'
They ain't fucking with me, they ain't fucking with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fucking Nic, as long as she be fucking rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'alls a fucking trip
Young Money dungeon bitch, my swagger is punching bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun ""Gunovich""
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch

Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me

519,Fall For You,"[Verse 1: Jaytekz]
Uh, I'd take a shot for you and everything we did
And everything we once was in our relationship
Everything was straight when we first started dating
Thought I'd never see the day when it's both our hearts breaking
So I'm drinking every weekend, speaking sober thoughts
Staring at my phone, wondering if I should call
Tell you how I feel, cause the pain still hasn't healed
Everything feels out of place, I think a part of me was killed
When I let you go, thinking we could take it slow
But one weeks past, already found another man to hold
I should have known, I mean you're in college right
You probably met someone at some fucking party right
I seen it coming, but chose to ignore it
In hopes that we could find each others love and then restore it
But you went out exploring, scoring like it’s a game
And I'm just sitting back like why the fuck do things change
Cause things change and there ain't shit that you can do about it
But take blame for all the bullshit that you provided
I can't deny it, I've made my mistakes
But I was trying to fix em' and now it's too late

[Verse 2: Jaytekz]
Uh, so I guess this is it, my final words
I really do wish the best for you, even if it hurts
I hope you find yourself a better dude, one that you deserve
I hope he does what I could never do and show you what it's worth When it works, imagine love without a struggle
Just happiness and peace where the couple never crumbles
A stumble here and there, but the sound is so subtle
Cause love remains humble when the world seems to rumble
And I promise you, you won't dare forget my name
When you needed help, I'm the one who always fucking came
I'm the one who picked you up when you slipped up in the rain
I'm the one who took you back when you left me in such pain
You remember that, all that bullshit you said
You'll love me till the end, but you're loving him instead
I can bet what you're giving him comes from your regrets
You can have it, sincerely
A love that was never meant to be",JayteKz,2009,"[42, 36, 46]",3
520,Love Remains The Same,"I lost everything I had inside

Tears of sorrow

Memories, suffering, look at me now
Is this the man you knew?
Certainties break down

This love remains the same
As a mirror without image
These words it cannot change
As a mirror without a name... Break!

Somebody wants to be a fighter
Somebody can cry
I just wanna find myself

This love remains the same
As a mirror without image
These words it cannot change
As a mirror, where you burn again...

...It's you, it's you
Your love can leave me blind, it's so sweet
When it takes me high but I feel guilty now... yeah

This love remains the same

I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment

I can't get your smile out of my mind

Modesty is just so hard to find

522,Fly On The Wall,"[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Fly away, sometimes I wish I could fly away
Fly away, sometimes I wish I could fly away

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
There was a young ghetto child going wild after running 'round
Who came from a happy home, then got lost in the jungle
Hit a lick for like ten chicks
Brought it back to the bricks then got everybody rich
Started his own clique, recruited all piranhas
His favorite phrase: that's on Hunters
His niggas trained to go
Wherever he point, you got shitted on
Or smoked like a joint
Here comes the line-up, first 48 people remain silent
All his goons still remain violent
Damn, there goes another body, oh shit, sirens
Another bite the dust like Mickey Thompson tires
Lights flashing, niggas stunt like the grammys
No one’s exempt, they’ll sell a rock to your granny
Now here is the part where jealousy comes out here to play
Hood politics official when they want you out of the way
Now back then we ain't never mention this word
‘Cause if you caught snitching consequences fo sho
Niggas'll throw you out on the freeway with a shell in your dome
And no feelings is shown
Then look inside the eyes of these killers
A blank stare, that's stiffer than stones
Got you wondering, where in life, where they went wrong?
Don't wanna cross these types, if you do think twice
It's life saving, don't get caught slipping when you ice skating

[Hook: Jay Rock]
When you stand still you could witness it all
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall
When you stand still you could witness it all
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Now when the sun rise, this young man sees money's a big deal
New Chevelle,  wipe in the morning dew cross his windshield
Killer's saturation while the smokers run through sanitation
For the bags of hands, this young man, calculating for the long run
Since ya homies been on one lately
No one's safe, he keeping his chrome off safety
Headed to the function, momma's gone, they children out cussin'
See this young man hit this bitch for all them niggas she fuckin'
Knowin' one man's been intimate touchin'
Til the big homie found out, gave his ass a concussion
He don't want nothin' now, he walkin' on crutches now
Couldn't see him from the shoulders
He thinkin' how can he buck him down
Hold up, the eyes is watchin'
Gotta be more smart now, devise this option
Watch how the plot thickens
The clock tickin', his weak spot is a thot
Just notice he can't stop trickin', got him
Now this how it starts
He take a bat when he know to go play with his heart
Had his nose wide open while gettin' head at the park
She set the GPS location like this where we park
Now you know what's next
It's crazy how life can end all through a text
Got us wishin' we was all born with a vest
I know you prolly witnessed it all
But picture the vision from the fly on the walll

[Hook: Jay Rock]
When you stand still you could witness it all
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall
When you stand still you could witness it all
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Jay Rock what up though? I'm here with you
Let's give 'em a classic, you know I’m here to prepare it with you
Keep niggas inspired, you know I'm comin' to share it with you
And when the wheels fall off I'll get out and put on a spare with you
Let me be real with you, mhmm
It's been selected, let me give you my fly on the wall perspective
Sometimes niggas don't listen, I'm hopin' this serves its purpose
Cause that's some of the realest shit that you talked about in them verses
Hopin' they feel this shit despite how the devils is workin'
To avoid tellin' on myself, I try to speak in third person
See we done been through some shit, throughout my lifeline
We was flies on the wall too from the shit we seen in our lifetime
And through these songs there were digressions
Some stories we shared through music
Question if we in our right mind
Now I'm a new fuckin' fly on the wall
I wanna see how many rappers really write rhymes
And we've been rockin' for a long time, Jay Rock
They ain't got a clue of the timing
I heard about you from Slay when you started shinin'
They ain't knowin' this our fourth collab from 2009 and
Slay heard about you from my nigga Wack
But they ain't know when Top Dawg introduced you, nigga
The way we out, we always give you crack
Not knowin' that we had the raw just to split you, niggas
To tell the truth there's no problem we can't solve
So let me tell the truth, again I'm so proud of how you evolved
And while me and Jay Rock kill these niggas 'til they dissolve
I hope you appreciate my view as the biggest fly on the wall",Jay Rock,2009,"[91, 84]",2

Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

[Verse 1]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

[Chorus]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

[Verse 2]
When I be riding man I swear I see her face at every turn
Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
My woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

[Chorus]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything

Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything

528,My Life,"[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My, yeah, yeah, mmm
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

[Verse 2: Eminem & 50 Cent]
While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin' shed, sharpenin' my machete
Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, gettin' my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-get-even?
I think you fuckin' meatballs keep on just forgettin'
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginnin'
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offendin'! (Yeah!)
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin' up!
You’re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinkin' about just sayin', ""Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!""
‘Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul in this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch) and I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
‘Cause I'm runnin' in circles with—

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe, maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy, now pick the casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic, it's sad
It's never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion

You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Ugh
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'ma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack

Deeper than words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

I would pay my life for you

530,Let It Go,"[Verse 1]
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

[Breakdown]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

531,What About Now,"[Verse 1]
Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading
From all the things that we are
Are not saying
Can we see beyond the scars
And make it to the dawn?

[Verse 2]
Change the colors of the sky
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you

[Chorus]
What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

[Verse 3]
The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
As shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

Now that we're here
Now that we've come this far
Just hold on
There is nothing to fear
For I am right beside you
For all my life
I am yours

What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?

532,Anything Goes,"Times have changed
And we've often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock
If today
Any shock they should try to stem
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
Plymouth Rock would land on them

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now, God knows
Anything goes
Good authors, too, who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why, nobody will oppose
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is
Intruding at nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her
Then I suppose
Anything goes
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-
-ough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once had several chateaus
When folks who still can ride in jitneys
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys
Lack baby clothes
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Then 'Nana' shows
Anything goes
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up-
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(If any brains you've got)
From those little radios
So Missus R., with all her trimmings
Can broadcast abed from Simmons
Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes",Cole Porter,2009,[98],1
