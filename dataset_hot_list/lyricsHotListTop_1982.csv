0,Maneater,"[Verse 1]
She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see what you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man
She could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Whoa-oh, here she comes, watch out)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater)
Ooh, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, watch out)
She'll only come out at night, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater)
The woman is wild, woo
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, watch out, boy, watch out, boy
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
(Oh-oh, here she comes, watch out)
Yeah, yeah, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater)
She's watching and waiting, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)

1,Mickey,"[Антихайп, СЛАВА КПСС]
Тут Соня Мармеладова, а вот тебе бы надо бы
Пару ингаляторов, удар дефибриллятора
Чтобы зачитать, как я, звезда амфитеатра
Ведь Соня на битах, как сеанс у педиатра
А дети все кричат: ""О Соня!""
Мышке твой хуй больно в кишках колется
Весь кишлак гомик, я как КиШ - на троне
Ты летишь, как Коби. Разряжаю весь патронник
Ра-та-та ты под землёй, как кобальт
Разрываюсь на битах, словно здесь Чернобыль
Школьница Дэма
Отряд камикадзе — тут школьница эмо
К-К-КОМБО как Кимбо Слайс,
Тут MGK, Соня - киборг Сайракс
Ты Майли Сайрус, я Savage-Savage
Двойная рифма - Double Damage
Я Дамблдор, ты тут долдон
Забываешь свой текст, как купить гандон
Жирный flow, Ким Дотком
Илюха поц норм, но он ебанько
Читает свой рэп с таким ебалом
Словно занят прямо щас тройным аналом
Двойным аналом, у всех изъяны, бро
У твоего грайма лицо Марьяны Ро
Это как так? Ты мудак, тик-так время утекло
Ты не вагван, ты не ванван
Твой Декамерон - плак-плак на битах
Илюха поц норм, но он ебанько
Ебанько
Ебанько
Ебанько
Ебанько
Ебанько
У твоего грайма лицо Марьяны Ро
Это как так? Ты мудак, тик-так время утекло
Ты не вагван, ты не ванван
Твой Декамерон - плак на битах
Не успел попасть в бит, пиф-паф по пятам
Эй, да у нас тут дырка
Мини Маус - МС Подстилка
В тебе грайма нет, слушай Меззу
Твой флоу — Рогатка, давалка с Версус
Флоу — шлюшка. Гулял с другими
Флоу — пушка. Слова, как гири
Чейни, помнишь на финале тебя знатно слили?
Ты хотел мне отплатить? Сука, скинь на Qiwi
Просто мусор, просто клининг
После тусы топить под lean'ом
Последний чирик, свое горе пятаки
Воскрешаю русский grime, будто Соня клирик
Я зомби-критик. Под зомби Риддим
Качусь в темноте мимо зон бикини
Но меня не проведешь, как Иисуса на мякине
Пусть твоё очко не клумба, но мы всё же засадили туда
Семя антихайпа
Я сожру тебя с говном со всеми котяхами
Ты боишься насекомых, ебанный гук
Тебя собьет мой Volkswagen Жук
Какие панчи?
Какие люди, такие панчи
Эти 2 подружки, сестрички Олсен
И отсосут сестрички awesome
Сестрички awesome
И отсосут сестрички awesome (Ах)
Эпидемия (ях), говнорэперов (рав!)
Я не буду даже сильно тут батлить вас
Эпидемия (ях), говнорэперов (рав!)
На десерт у меня твой шоколадный глаз

[Verse]
Какой антихайп? Ты продался
Делая то что модно и что хочет челядь
Но чем больше сосешь, тем больше челюсть
Ты боишься Мирона, будто он чеченец
В тебе грайма нет и не было никогда
Переоценен, как в Юнайтед Погба

[Verse]
Какой антихайп? Ты продался

Но чем больше сосешь, тем больше челюсть
Ты боишься Мирона, будто он чеченец
В тебе грайма нет и не было никогда
Переоценен, как в Юнайтед Погба
Тебе дали хайпа, чуть больше бабла
И ты отрекся от того что раньше сказал
""Я лучше сдохну ебанным ноунеймом
Чем прославлюсь и стану тобой""
Вот это жопа, прям как у J. Lo
Можешь убить себя прям перед толпой
Ой, что передумал?
Где же совесть ты нашел Яндекс или Google
Скрывался, ставил на mute трубку
Ты продал имя, как свою куртку
Твой слушатель дети 12 лет
Ты певец малолеток и это твой удел
Посасывать хуец за монету тут пиздец
Опонненту, как членом бы ты не дудел
Штамповка! Где прежний запал и дух интеллекта
Андрюха сказал - Слава в миг исполнил, потому как Андрюха директор
Это хайп машина по продаже мерча и походу она грузовая
Нахуй качество, писать на количество легче, похоже на игру Замая
Слушатель, ты не поверишь глазам
Все его заслуги - это zero
Всю твою известность сделал ты сам?
Всю твои известность сделал Мирон
Куплеты тоска
Ведь это говно или подснежник
Да бля!
Замая ведь отсюда и так срежут

Каждый день. Это моя тактика
Я хочу, чтобы в зале кричали: ""Нахуй Антихайп""

У него антихайп головного мозга
Головного мозга...

Слава не забыл свои корни просто
У него Антихайп головного мозга
Замая мы просто ебали в дёсна
У него Антихайп головного мозга

Слава не забыл свои корни просто
У него Антихайп головного мозга
Замая мы просто ебали в дёсна
У него Антихайп головного мозга

[Verse]
Как наступить на это борзое ебало
Чтобы порция навоза нам на кросы не попала
Батл, не выходим босыми - мы два сапога пара
Кто-то не выходит Боссом из того самого бара

Парень, на их поле боя ты – воин не великий
Без пробы свежей крови – не ровня для элит
Хмурил брови на них, а они бровью не повели
И все от мала до велика тебя продинамили

И тут бам – без разбора
Будут на органы все из вас порваны
Здесь царь бомба, есть в нас порох
Сделать раздолбанным весь танцол
Ведь здесь сто сорок, а его пульс иной
Переплюнул тебя, убери соплю, не ной
Как морозить хуйню, так ты в плюсе, но
На этом минусе ты абсолютный ноль

Вам шах и мат, всего в один ход
Ты падший примат, а не злобный Кинг Конг
Динозавр, а залы с тех пор не битком
Твой рэп – это сайт испортил бит.ком

Ком этот встанет в горле белком
Его я заставлю ссать кипятком
Я бы на месте Мирона вас слал далеко
Вы не антихайп - вы Слава и Ко

Слишком жестко, воу
Ты мне на батле не товарищ, а тамбовский волк
Это повесть Крылова – лаять брось, хуйло
Ведь у меня глаза, как у Слона, на Моську, лох

До вызова Мирона вас врозь вело
Замай притянутый за уши - в твой силок
Ты его бросил в лодку, но с его скиллом
Это говно не улов - оно само всплыло

Или как Бог над водой –
Иконой для потомков Тупака, Кападонны
В рэпе ты дедок, типа тебе так удобно?
А рвать на биток так – нихуя подобного

Вдох – снова под воду. И потом
Если вы, гондоны, тупо из-за опыта готовы
Называть воды потоком этот топовый потоп
То у кого-то много опыта тут только допотопного


Пробил как дно эхолот
Это мой прорыв года через твой потолок
Ты в ступе годы, а не воду толок
В говно по локоть - ты не воин болот

Замая мы просто ебали в дёсна
У тебя Антихайп головного мозга
Слава не забыл свои корни просто
У него Антихайп головного мозга

Я бы мог это доказывать, но
Мне без мазы из пальца высасывать гной
Одной твоей фразой пересказанной мной
Я за раз смою 2 заразы в одной

Суй в анус весь fame, Слава
Пиздуй нахуй звездой батлов
Долбись в сраку, я останусь
Ведь сверху, падла, больнее падать

[Verse 1]
Самый вырезаемый МЦ
А ты кто? Просто прицеп
В этой рэп игре, Ден Чейни
Я тут хан, а ты челядь

Че ты хочешь? Блять, я не понял
Позвал на бой, ты шоли гомик
Тебя в порнухе позовут на бис
Ведь меня учил стилю Рома Tills

Рвать на битах
Рвать на битах
Нахуй твой грайм
Рвать на битах
Рвать на битах
Рвать на битах
Нахуй твой хайп

[Verse 2]
Твой грайм - грим, ты не grime green
Твой блинк-блинк - это блин, блин
Ты не Кингпин, кретин
Твои панчи в молоко или кефир?

Тараторка года, ты как ебаный робот
Бит не замечаешь вовсе
Но бомбит, когда пролетаешь мимо орбит
Хайпа

Ты просто калека, ты мне не коллега
Я буду рвать тебя на битах
Мне похуй, Чейни

Рвать на битах
Рвать на битах
Нахуй твой грайм
Рвать на битах

Рвать на битах
Нахуй твой грайм
Я хан Замай
Рвать на битах

[Verse]
Тысячи, тысячи, не совершенных грехов, еще
Тонны бумаги, тыщи, не марами дворов, трущоб
Килограммы на форматы, класть еще плотью тюки
Ведь я в лучах звездной болезни, как Склодовская-Кюри

И подохну когда придавит плитой ядерный гриф
Но позже чем, дядька Сэм тебя Микки Маус раскабалит
Ты как в цирке на туловище маска и парик
А я по жизне ебанутый, Дай мне 9 грамм, Айболит

Из чрева вылезает новый парадокс герой
Опустели кинозалы, просмотровое окно
Горит одно лишь, будто пуканы, всех этих прото звезд
Я Рокко Сиффреди, трахал вас в разных позах, но всерьез

[Hook]
Слово СПБ, холопы ТНТ
Вы уздечку на битах порвали? Не смеши людей

[СЛАВА КПСС]
Рвать на битах свою сраную глотку
Я не стану, мне надо бомбу
Набить гвоздями, подайте хавчик
И покурить, словно я Крысавчик

От фитиля
Что за жаркий пудель? Мс. Фигляр
Дикий Чейни, как Джеки Чан, но
Одену его туз, как футляр (р-р!)

Кого порвать? На каких битосах? Ты что Кобейн?
Любишь 2 ствола во рту. Порнохабу ты сказал: ""god damn""
Видя, как сосут эти малышки на битах
Ваша крыша уже едет, словно Чейни cadillac

Тучно, белая корова. Назовитесь ""Як-як-як""
Но я прожарю это мясо, словно в передаче ""Смак""
Отъезжаю от напасов, но верю все не напрасно
Моя туса, строго в красном. Зюганов и Карла Маркса

Борода светит вам
Твой черный flow - у меня Ку-клукс клан
Dead party, со мной Кыргызстан
Домой дойдете, но по кускам

Слова из книги ""О великом Чейни""
Но тут не слова о великом Чейни
Ведь это книга о великом Чейни
И тут не строчки из великой, сука, книги Чейни

Слово СПБ (книга Чейни), холопы ТНТ (книга Чейни)
Вы уздечку на битах (книга Чейни) порвали, не смеши людей

Чейни, Mickey Mouse, пошел-ка ты нахуй

[Verse]
Я живу не чтобы фан меня любил и целовал
Мое имя на могиле набивает цену вам
Или двигаться по фану из вагины в целлофан
На свет в конце туннеля, чтобы кинуться на фары

Будто пес, что бежит под колеса машины
Пока я жив ты просто скажи мне, что
Разменять мой возраст ошибок
На вшивую жизнь, этих полных фальшивок?

Нахуй вам жить на полусогнутых
Если на них не доходили до высот вы
Если вы, до выноса команды Зондер
Вскрылись и выдохлись, как банки содовой

Щека Бога, твоя щека
Я вещаю из убогого ящика, в будущем
Но 4 года маячив тут
Ставил крест на своем настоящем

А вы таращиться будете, да
На нем суммы просмотров без букв и дат
Но мне лететь на удар, в темноту не беда
Мне ничто осветит этот путь в никуда

Камикадзе все ближе к земле
И вселенная дышит этим выбросом лет
Один вдох, все выжать в себе
В забеге к себе, ведь ты же сильнее

Батл-рэп мне как, Мекка она теперь
Меня доведет от фаната до фанатика
Если эту секту придать, то анафеме
На волоске висят, как на канате

Проклинать его, он тянет вниз
А время альпинист, вниз это немыслимо
Снова чистый лист, но хуже для Дениса
Это рвать на битах душу атеиста

[Hook]
Пока мы летаем там, где Икар не летал
Вы стоите на своем, как Земля на китах
Мне на плечи давит дар, я как планку Титан
Держу SLOVOSPB и буду рвать на битах

Пока мы летаем там, где Икар не летал
Вы стоите на своем, как Земля на китах
Мне на плечи давит дар, я как планку Титан
Держу SLOVOSPB и буду рвать на битах

[Mickey Mouse]
[Verse]
Работал долго, ведь был никем
Выборг не Лондон, а Бирмингем
Я все вам отдал, чтобы быть свободным
Тут безысходность под BPM

Мы делали батлы по фану
До того, как это стало мейнстримом
Всем было поебать на рекламу
Если в кругу, то стадо не стимул

Путь от Альфа бара, до финала в А2
Будто полный зал или ебаный подвал
Я прошел не за день, не надо бабла
И мой flow теперь тебе достанет до гланд

#SLOVOSPB
И это значит то что я уже весь в игре
Не замечал ухмылок в спину и спесь гиен
Мы им брезгуем, время отсекало лишних, как лезвием

Я проклят
И в этом вся моя карма
Мой город Gotham, мой мир DC
А не счастливый и красочный Marvel

Скажи мне сука хоть что-то
То, что я и так не знал о себе
Меня не любили паблики ваши элитные
Зато самоотдача стала сильнее

И ярость огней я не замечал
Меня не остановить дернув за рычаг
И кажется мне я прожигал каждый свой день
Как до записи летела неделя за час

И я рву на битах, ведь другого выхода нет
Первые струны (что выдавали аккомпанемент)
Нас копировали всех под один трафарет
Ведь мы #SLOVOSPB и нас хранит Бафомет

Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out
This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

[Verse 1]
While my sister was on stage, killing it like a motherfucker
I was enraged, feeling it like a motherfucker
Bird in a cage, you would never know what I was dealing with
Went our separate ways, but I was happy she was killing it
Bittersweet, she was up, I was down
No lie, I feel good for her, but what do I do now?
Forget the records, off the record, I was going through some bullshit
Post Survivor, she on fire, who wanna hear my bullshit?
Meanwhile this nigga putting his hands on me
I swear y’all don’t know the half of this industry

Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out
This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

[Verse 2]
And it’s almost been a decade
I’m behind them black shades
Roll up like it’s all good, right up out that escalade
Fix my make-up, “Get it together, Kelly, get it together”
Then we make up, well get it together, nigga, get it together
Kinda lucky, I was in her shadow
Phone call from my sister, “what’s the matter?”
She said, “Oh no baby, you gotta leave!”
I’m on the kitchen floor, he took the keys
I was mad at everybody, I mean everybody
Yeah, her, her, her her everybody
Five years later, I got my shit down pat
Think I had it good, and they don’t know how bad
Fooled everybody, except myself
Soaking in this hurt, bathing in the dirt

[Hook]
Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out
This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

[Verse 3]
So here I am in the spin cycle we’re coming and we’re going
Nobody can notice
And I was trapped in his house, lying to my mama
Thought it could get no worse as we maximize the drama
Started to call them people on him
I was battered
He hittin the window like it was me, until it shattered
He pulled me out, he said, “Don’t nobody love you but me
Not your mama, not your daddy and especially not Bey.”
He turned me against my sister
I missed you

[Hook]
Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
Let’s do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
When you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out
When you make pain look this good it never wears out

[Verse 1]
Gloria, you're always on the run now
Running after somebody
You gotta get him somehow
I think you've got to slow down
Before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown
So be careful not to show it

[Chorus]
You really don't remember
Was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

[Verse 2]
Gloria, don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line
Oh-oh-oh, calling Gloria

[Chorus]
Gloria (Gloria), I think they got your number
(Gloria) I think they got the alias
(Gloria) That you've been living under
(Gloria) But you really don't remember
Was it something that they said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha
Gloria, how's it gonna go down?
Will you meet him on the main line
Or will you catch him on the rebound?
Will you marry for the money

And you really don't remember
Was it something that he said?

Was it something that they said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

5,Steppin' Out,"[Verse 1: Joe Jackson]
Now
The mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes

[Verse 2: Joe Jackson]
We
So tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

[Verse 3: Joe Jackson]
We
Are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the T.V. and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight?

You
Can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while
If you follow me

Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?

And you know I don't wanna lose that, cause I still believe

I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see

I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feeling

He turned to me as if to say

15,You And I,"[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Feel like I have dated every woman in the world
Most were beautiful
Some were corporate
Worked in a little cubicle
I done some shit to some that I would never do to you
Cause some were tailor made but still wasn't suitable
Come to yours I see why you be elusive
Some took advantage off you, some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you, some were abusive
Most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
Ain't gotta say a word, I already know it
Even if you scared to death it's ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you, don't wanna blow it
And I wouldn't be surprised if I did, that's typical Joe shit
I lie forever
Not only do she trust me, her body is a work of art
There's a beauty in every ugly
So for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
Together we'll never have to see em' again
I love you

[Chorus: Emanny]
You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I've been with every woman in this world, except a virgin chick
Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
We're both broken pieces, both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much, still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage, it's a carry-on
So in life without, I couldn't conceive
I tried to dump her one time, but she wouldn't leave
And I ain't want her to, so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered the word I damn near couldn't breathe
Been trough the run around, took her off the carousel
Still in shock that her passion's unparalleled
I know some exes must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down, we had to gel
I love you

[Chorus: Emanny]
You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I've been with every type of woman, some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars, but still they acted young
Some were gossip queens, but I ain't mad at them
You make bittersweet, today that shit matters none
Some I knew wouldn't last when that crash begun
Some played it cool, but wasn't half as fun
Some ain't over me, they just blame away
Some I ruined myself, others came that way
Some were modelesque, left, started gaining weight
Other waited to gain, but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with, just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love, don't know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you, so it's ill how you believe in it
Cause you done dated a few
If I'mma take a chance on love, I thank God he let me take it with you
I love you

And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now

Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice
I know what it's like from the other side
So baby who am I to be that other guy?

[Verse 2]
This could be your home, girl, a special place
Something much more than your great escape
Girl I would give anything now
If you didn't had everything now
He doesn't have to hear that you feel the same
You tell me that your love for me will never change
Unless you change everything now
It doesn't mean anything now
If it's him that you've chosen
Then we need to stop closing the door
Cause while he's at home waiting
We can't pretend there's something more

[Chorus 2]
Girl, I'm sitting here wondering what it is that we've done
Baby who am I to be that other guy?
Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt

Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice
I know what it's like from the other side
So baby you decide who's the other guy?
Cause baby, who am I to be that other guy?",Jesse McCartney,1982,"[18, 21, 27, 34, 51, 59]",6
18,The Look Of Love (Part One),"[Verse 1]
When your world is full of strange arrangements
And gravity won't pull you through
You know you're missing out on something
Well that something depends on you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(All I'm saying)
It takes a lot to love you
(All I'm doing)
You know it's true
(All I need now)
There's one thing
Yes, one thing that turns this gray sky to blue

[Chorus]
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love

[Verse 2]
When your girl has left you out on the pavement
(Goodbye)
When your dreams fall apart at the seams
Your reason for living, your reason for leaving
Don't ask me what it means

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Who's got the look?)
I don't know the answer to that question
(Where's the look?)
If I knew I would tell you
(What's the look?)
Look for your information
Yes, there's one thing, one thing that still hold true
(What's that?)

[Chorus]
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(Look of love)

[Verse 3]
If you judge a book by the cover
Then you judge the look by the lover
I hope you'll soon recover
Me, I go from one extreme to another

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And though my friends just might ask me
They say, ""Martin, maybe one day you'll find true love""
I say, ""Maybe there must be a solution
To the one thing, the one thing we can't find""

[Chorus]
(That's the look, that's the look)
Sisters and brothers
(That's the look, that's the look)
Should help each other
(That's the look, that's the look)
Ooh, ooh Heavens above
(That's the look, that's the look)
Hip hip hooray
(That's the look, that's the look)
Yippee ai yippee aiay
(That's the look, that's the look)
Be lucky in love

19,You Can't Hurry Love,"[Intro]
I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

[Verse 1]
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

[Verse 2]
No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on
I remember mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
(Now wait)

[Bridge]
No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting (Ooh, until that day)
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy

And he gon' need an Aspirin, hook him up

And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, ""What up?"" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em

I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next

Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

35,Heart Of The Night,"From child to youth; from youth to arduous man;
From lethargy to fever of the heart;
From faithful life to dream-dowered days apart;
From trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of ban;—
Thus much of change in one swift cycle ran
Till now. Alas, the soul!—how soon must she
Accept her primal immortality,—
The flesh resume its dust whence it began?

O Lord of work and peace! O Lord of life!
O Lord, the awful Lord of will! though late,
Even yet renew this soul with duteous breath:
That when the peace is garnered in from strife,
The work retrieved, the will regenerate,
This soul may see thy face, O Lord of death!",Dante Gabriel Rossetti,1982,"[36, 38, 50, 59, 73]",5

Well, we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem, they're killing time
Filling out forms, standing in line

Well, our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance, danced with them slow

[Chorus 1]
And we're living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

[Verse 3]
Well, we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard, if we behaved

[Verse 4]
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke, chromium steel

[Chorus 2]
And we're waiting here in Allentown
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

[Bridge]
Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face

[Chorus 3]
Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today

39,Two Less Lonely People In The World,"I was down, my dreams were wearing thin
When you're lost, where do you begin?
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
Looking for the love that never came my way

Then you smiled and I reached out to you
I could tell you were lonely too
One look and then it all began for you and me
The moment that we touched I knew that there would be

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people
In the world tonight

Just to think what I might have missed
Looking back how did I exist
I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far
But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people
In the world tonight

Tonight I fell in love with you
And all the things I never knew
Seemed to come to me somehow
'Cause, baby, love is here and now there's

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people

40,Muscles,"Muscles

Injuries to the brain, spinal cord or nerves can affect muscle control. When nerves lose control of muscles, it is called paralysis. When a muscle is injured, a nearby muscle often takes over for the injured one.

Bones

Bones weaken with age. Older adults have more brittle bones. Sometimes they break surprisingly easily. This gradual weakening of bones is called osteoporosis.

Joints

All joints have a normal range of movement in which they can move freely, without too much stress or strain. When joints are forced beyond this range, ligaments stretch and tear.

TYPES OF INJURIES

The four basic types of injuries:

- Fractures
- Dislocations
- Sprains
- Strains

What to Look For

Always suspect a severe injury when any of the following signals are present:

- There is pain. One of the most common signals in any muscle, bone or joint injury is pain. The injured area may be very painful to touch and move.
- There is signiﬁ cant bruising and swelling. The area may be swollen and red or bruised.
- There is signiﬁ cant deformity. The area may be twisted or strangely bent. It may have abnormal lumps, ridges and hollows.
- The person is unable to use the affected part normally.
- There are bone fragments sticking out of a wound.
- The person feels bones grating or the person felt or heard a snap or pop at the time of injury.
- The injured area is cold, numb and tingly.
- The cause of the injury suggests that it may be severe.

When to Call 9-1-1

- There is obvious deformity
- There is moderate or severe swelling and discoloration.
- Bones sound or feel like they are rubbing together.
- A snap or pop was heard or felt at the time of the injury.
- There is a fracture with an open wound at, or bone piercing through, the injury site.
- The injured person cannot move or use the affected part normally.
- The injured area is cold and numb.
- The injury involves the head, neck or spine.
- The injured person has trouble breathing.
- The cause of the injury suggests that the injury may be severe.
- It is not possible to safely or comfortably move the person to a vehicle for transport to a hospital.

What to Do Until Help Arrives

General care for injuries to muscles, bone and joints includes following the mnemonic RICE:

- Rest: Do not move or straighten the injured area.
- Immobilize: Stabilize the injured area in the position it was found. Splint the injured part only if the person must be moved or transported to receive medical care and it does not cause more pain. Minimizing movement can prevent further injury.
- Cold: Fill a plastic bag with ice and water or wrap ice with a damp cloth and apply ice to the injured area for periods of about 20 minutes. Place a thin barrier between the ice and bare skin. If 20-minute icing cannot be tolerated, apply ice for periods of 10 minutes. If continued icing is needed, remove the pack for 20 minutes, and then replace it. Cold reduces internal bleeding, pain and swelling. Do not apply heat as there is no evidence that applying heat helps muscle, bone or joint injuries.
- Elevate: Elevate the injured part only if it does not cause more pain. Elevating the injured part may help reduce swelling.

Splinting an Injury

Anatomic splints.
- The person’s body is the splint. For example, you can splint an arm to the chest or an injured leg to the uninjured leg (Fig. 8-10).
Soft splints.
- Soft materials, such as a folded blanket, towel, pillow or folded triangular bandage, can beused for the splint (Fig. 8-11). A sling is a speciﬁc kind of soft splint that uses a triangular bandage tied to support an injured arm, wrist or hand.
Rigid splints.
- Padded boards, folded magazines or newspapers, or padded metal strips that do not have any sharp edges can serve as splints (Fig. 8-12).
The ground.
- An injured leg stretched out on the ground is supported by the ground.

Head, Neck and Spinal Injuries

Injuries to the head, neck or spine can cause paralysis, speech or memory problems or other disabling conditions. These injuries can damage bone and soft tissue, including the brain and spinal cord.

An injury to the brain can cause bleeding inside the skull.

The spine is a strong, ﬂexible column of small bones that support the head and trunk. Injuries to the spine can fracture vertebrae and tear ligaments. In some cases, the vertebrae can shift and cut or squeeze the spinal cord. This can paralyze the person or be life threatening.

What to Look For

You also should suspect a head, neck or spinal injury if the injured person:

- Was involved in a motor vehicle crash or subjected to another signiﬁcant force.
- Was injured as a result of a fall from greater than a standing height.
- Is wearing a safety helmet that is broken.
- Complains of neck or back pain.
- Has tingling or weakness in the extremities.
- Is not fully alert.
- Appears to be intoxicated.
- Appears to be frail or older than 65 years.
- Is a child younger than 3 years with evidence of a head or neck injury.

What to Do Until Help Arrives

While you are waiting for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel to arrive, the best care you can give is to minimize movement of the person’s head, neck and spine. As long as the person is breathing normally, support the head and neck in the position found. Do this by placing your hands on both sides of the person’s head in the position in which you found it. Support the person’s head in that position until EMS personnel take over supporting the person’s head. If the head is sharply turned to one side, do not move it. Support the head and neck in the position found.

The person may become confused, drowsy or unconscious. Breathing may stop. The person may be bleeding. If the person is unconscious, keep the airway open and check breathing.

Concussions

What to Look For

- Confusion, which may last from moments to several minutes.
- Headache.
- Repeated questioning about what happened.
- Temporary memory loss, especially for periods immediately before and after the injury.
- Brief loss of consciousness.
- Nausea and vomiting.
- Speech problems (patient is unable to answer questions or obey simple commands).
- Blurred vision or light sensitivity.

What to Do Until Help Arrives

- Support the head and neck in the position in which you found it.
- Maintain an open airway.
- Control any bleeding and apply dressings to any open wounds.
- Do not apply direct pressure if there are any signs of an obvious skull fracture.
- If there is clear ﬂ uid leaking from the ears or a wound in the scalp, cover the area loosely with a sterile gauze dressing.
- Monitor the person for any changes in condition.
- Try to calm and reassure the person. Encourage the person to talk with you; it may prevent loss of consciousness.

Chest Injuries

What to Do Until Help Arrives

What to Look For

If the injury is serious, the person will have trouble breathing.

Pelvic Injuries

- Severe pain.
- Bruising.
- Possible external bleeding.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting (which may include blood).
- Weakness.
- Thirst.
- Tenderness or a tight feeling in the abdomen.
- Possible loss of sensation in the legs or inability to move the legs.

Be alert for the signals of shock, which could indicate internal bleeding and/or blood loss.

Cause we're destined to look

44,Memory,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon
It will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

[Optional verse:]
Sunlight through the trees in summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower, as the day is breaking
The memory is fading

48,All Those Lies,"History repeats itself
It all comes back again
Leaders and preachers
Believers and deceivers
Fanatically leading, Blindly following
Apparently prayers make no sense
Maybe they are not (so) intense
The bigger the power
The more is madness
Fanatically leading, Blindly following

Chorus:
And they still tell us all those lies
And they don't care that someone dies
Will the world end up in devastation?
All we can do is pray

Religious hate seals someone's fate
Heaven is promised for suicide
Does not matter who also died
It seems that all the angels have disappeared
We are left on our own
Its seems that purgatory is coming near
Do we believe in a God?
Is there a sense for us to live if we destroy?
Seems like nothing remains
Fanatically leading, Blindly following

Chorus x2

They will prepare for another holy war
They will prepare for nuclear attacks
They will prepare for judgment day to come
They will prepare for the end of all our days

Still they tell lies
Don't care that someone dies
The world ends up in devastation
Still they tell lies
Don't care that someone dies
Or do we hope and pray for salvation?
Lies... they tell us lies
Lies... they tell us lies",Dawn Of Destiny,1982,"[49, 60, 73]",3

Way
You're standing over there trying to be gangster copping your favorite lean
You give her the head nod
O my god you're the craziest thing

Dancing
And she's loving you all night long
In your little world she's your best girl
It's all money

Where you go everybody want to know
So they can put it in a magazine
Next to the ad for the latest fad

With this car these rims this grill you'll be
The illest on the scene
Whatever whatever all you need is your music
And you'll be a party machine 'cause you'll be dancing

One, two
How many times you look for happy
And you never see the rich folks there?
But if the DJ really dropped a needle all the true players just don't
Care
When all the news just give me the blues and make you want to pop a pill
What difference does it make who gots the most bank, it's just ink and
Chlorophyll
Everybody's dancing
And loving you all night long
In your little world she's your best girl
It's all money
Ain't nothing wrong

Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes
How can I be real?

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
Precious kisses, words that burn me
Lovers never ask you why

In my heart the fire's burning
Choose my color, find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step a step too far

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

Words are few I have spoken
I could waste a thousand years
Wrapped in sorrow, words are token
Come inside and catch my tears

You've been talking but believe me
If it's true you do not know
This boy loves without a reason
I'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything's not what you see
It's over again

That his eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two A.M

It's two A.M., the fear has gone
I'm sitting here waitin', the gun still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances

Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Where are you?

Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

And he says, ""Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone

My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?""

It's a slow sultry night
It'll take a lifetime til sunrise
If you won't stay with me tonight
Feel your breath caress my shoulder
As your heart reads my mind
You don't have to tell me anything
I can see everything in your eyes

It's so easy with you
I don't need an excuse
To be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe
That I'm feeling so free
To be the woman in me
Baby there's so much no man has ever touched
Of the woman in me

I might be trembling
But I'm not scared
Just my desire breaking free
I've never had a chance like this before
To unlock all the doors to the woman in me

It's so easy with you
I don't need an excuse
To be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe
That I'm feeling so free
To be the woman in me
Baby there's so much no man has ever touched

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
And uh, I started out dumb, sprung off a hood-rats
Listenin' to the radio, wishin' that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fuckin' me, mayne
Listen, I got a scheme, break away, do my own thang
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, Lord knows how they hate me
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards livin' as a thug
Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
Maybe they seen me rollin', look at all this green I'm holdin'
I get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen
Hopin' the heavenly father love a hustler
Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, ""Have a heart"" — fuck they feelings
I've been tryin' to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers, haha

Just care if there's more beer left

Say cheese, this just what I need
My scene, this just what I mean
I'm free its just what I see
Living life, no regrets
But If I could turn no to yes
And turn water to wine, turn broke to checks
Turn over my soul, eternal rest
Wait my turn, no rush for me
I'm right where I want to be
Where you at though?

But I can't complain, this is the moment I've been waiting for
Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door
I'm with Boy Better Know let them all in
But there's a flip side to all things
So before you sign yourself up to the high life
Make sure you read the small print
Please
Listen to me when I'm talking

I’m tweaking and it’s heavy
Ramen noodles 🍝 wit lasagna
I done concocted spaghetti
I be on the web like Eddie
Been in her dreams like Freddie
My mission is the game
I get ugly like I’m Betty
I be water hand on flame
Shoot my shot it be all netty

I used to be alright, now I tell em it’s already
Black nylon, patent leather, and my bottoms all reddy
I stay up on my grizzly like my first name was teddy
Baby girl you know I want you, but I’d like to make you beg me
You just beefing, I’m the deli
And your new home is my belly
Serenade her like R.Kelly
Then we head back to the Telli
Please don’t hit me on my celli
Less it’s straight to the g-maily
Got my package wit that jelly
Gave em dilemmas like nelly
They be asking can I see
And I look at em like barely
I was on that Wes like snipes
Cameras shooting it get deadly
And my parents made me odd
I’m the one that’s treated fairly
Get to spraying like its bod
Power circled, no not squarely
Baby asked me if I love her
I say yea but only rarely
On the toilet Elvis Presley
What I’m dropping will stay freshly
Just keep rocking to my medley
Will they stop me, ain’t no telling?
Wit that 4-5 like I’m Larry
Keep some potter like I’m Harry

I kept drumming with that Tom
Then I learned to sing like Gerri
To the game I will stay married
Like a virgin, keep some Mary
I can’t wait to wear no shirt
No tattoos cause I’m too sexy and
I wish I had that girl
Her heart heavy don’t tell Jesse
And I’m sorry, I’m still petty
I’m consistent, kept it steady
I started out wit Jenna
But I’m finna hit up Jenny
We used to pour hypnotic
And then mix it wit that henny
I used to count my pennies
Just to jet off like I’m Benny
A point 5 that’s from Kenny
Men be hating man like many
I boogied with my entry
You a DJ but don’t envy
It’s money it be plenty
Things I can do with a twenty
Every time I pull a scene
They say boy you need a Emmy
The semi, bring the frenzy
Got extendos kept it lengthy
Don’t bop it, no not diddy
It’s still all about the benji’s

Suburban bodied preppie
Colors smelly like I’m peppy
I’d never have to take it
She just give it when I’m dressy
And I prayed my bars on green
And stay heavy locked and levied
Was wit Tyler like I’m Perry
Popped some cristol like I’m cherry
I try not to be heady
But I’m colder than the yeti
Ima give it all I got
Like I’m on my last leggy
You want it come correctly
And I been saying directly
My manner is expressly
I’m too close so please don’t test me
And I bodied this grotesquely
Used to want that Pelli Pelli
Then I learned about power for that feature like I’m Dwele
On contrary for primary brought the flavor strawberry 🍓
I seasoned wit rosemary
Baked the pies I had blueberry
My juice was on cranberry
For detox next January

Raspberry not Raz-B
I got maybach but not Mayberry
Had scrolls on my blackberry
Who was posted on Woodbury
You found me like ancestry
Who was posted on mulberry
I mixed with that grey goose
Then I renamed it gooseberry
Underground like under belly
We was posted like Santelli
Castelli and Gastelli, I was looking for Martelli
Portelli had Vitelli till she cried just like Critelli
They taught me do it deftly
I been Riv since elementary
My jumper stay so wet
I can’t help from feeling densely
If tensely complimentary
We get lit at the dispensary
I swear I go so hard
Till my limbs start feeling trembly
I knew I been on road, used to take trips out to Findlay
I’m done wit all pretending
Been wiser wit my spending
I got Q’s right by the fig tree
Dat knee or dis knee?
I’m sorry for dismissing
Welcome back who had to get me

In 6th grade started kissing
Cause I started reminiscing
Before the snakes was hissing
Had to sneak but not no dissing
If I broke it had some fixing
Know what happens when I’m mixing
To win it like a menace
Off the boards did too much for thinking
I’m childish I’m not kidding
Tis the season here’s my giving
I’m loving and I’m living
I still walk it when I’m sitting
I’m drinking and I’m killing just to post up like a villain
Too choosy I’m just chillin
I’m not picky but I’m pickin
Up like I’m fishing
I got quicker just to get it
Hitting, swimming, kicking, sticking anything can get it
Digging filling spitting wishing shipment would get shipped in
Started swinging vines was hanging
I was avoiding the slipping
I got bluetooth then I chipped in
When I’m done just get to dipping
They was talking bout nobody
Now the shoes just started fittin

Tell me what's the definition of love?
It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but
Every time they fall up in it, they fall out, in and out it again

We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done
I know that we can do it

'Cause if it's wilding out, we got that, and forgiving, we got that
If it's talking 'bout how we feeling, we got that

Me and you know what the deal is but

[Chorus]
Since we ain't 21 (Oh)
They be tryna say it ain't love (A teenage love)
'Cause we can't hit the clubs
They be tryna say we're too young (A teenage love)

74,Funny How Time Slips Away,"[Verse 1]
Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems now, that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away

[Verse 2]
How's your new love?
I hope that he's doing fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him 'til the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away

[Verse 3]
I got to go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember, what I tell you
In time you're gonna pay
And it's surprising, how time slips away",Willie Nelson,1982,"[75, 80, 86]",3
75,All Touch,"I pushed her tense face away from me
I pushed her tense face away from me
The hard smile, the voice going on
Like a razor blade on glass
All touch but no contact

It hit me like, it hit me like, it hit me like a slap
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
Challenging eyes above the rim of a cocktail glass
Hoping I'd react
All touch and all touch and no contact

I pushed his hand away from me
I pushed his hand away from me
Splintering fragments of conversation never got down
To cold hard facts
All touch but no contact

It stabbed me like, it stabbed me like a knife in the back
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
Tense my body for the final attack
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact

I pushed her tense face away from me
I pushed her tense face away from me
The hard smile, the voice going on
Like a razor blade on glass
All touch but no contact

It hit me like, it hit me like, it hit me like a slap
All, all touch
All touch and all touch and no contact
Challenging eyes above the rim of a cocktail glass
Hoping I'd react
All touch and all touch and no contact

Stabbed me like, it stabbed me like a knife in the back

76,Hungry Like The Wolf,"[Verse 1]
Dark in the city night is a wire
Steam in the subway earth is afire
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Woman you want me give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

[Chorus]
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
Smell like I sound I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt  I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

[Verse 2]
Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
High blood Drumming on your skin it's so tight
You feel my heat I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

[Chorus 2]
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt  I'm after you
Scent and a sound. I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine I'm after you
Mouth is alive all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf

[Bridge]
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf

[Chorus 3]
Burning the ground I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt  I'm after you
I smell like I sound. I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt  I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf",Duran Duran,1982,[77],1
77,Are You Getting Enough Happiness,"Every time I go to the movies

All I see is happy love on the silver screen
Everywhere I go I see men and women lovin'

Kissin' and a-huggin'
Enjoyin' life
Oh
What's the matter with me

Am I lonely

Is there anybody out there who feels the same?

Every time I turn on my T.V

I see somebody lovin' somebody
Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?

Every time I open a book

Or read a magazine

There's happy love everywhere I look
Every page I turn I can read between the lines

That the boys gonna get it
Get it tonight
Oh
What's the matter with me

Am I the only one

Oh
Is there somebody out there who feels the same?

Every time I turn on my radio

I hear a love song playing on every show
Are you getting enough happiness?...

I need excitement in my life
I need happiness
Happiness every night
I need someone to call upon when the need is strong

For lovin'
For lovin'

Are you gettting enough happiness?...",Hot Chocolate,1982,"[78, 85]",2
78,Shoot For The Moon,"[Hook X2:]
Make sure you shoot for the moon (Make sure you shoot for the moon)
So you can land on the stars (So you can land on the stars)

And they gon' know who you are (And they gon' know who you are)
And they gon' know who you are (And they gon' know who you are)

[Verse 1:]
Listen up boys and girls once upon a time
Lived a Chinese kid they told him he couldn't rhyme
There was only one thing that was steady on his mind
That's to try and get signed so he got heavy on his grind
Sharpened up his skills machete'd every line
Put 110% into it everytime
Made it to the finals but never obtained a ring
If he could go back he wouldn't change a thing
Seen the ups and downs not nervous don't regret it
Cause when you're flying high turbulence is expected
Why continue? only he knows the real reason
10 years in the game and guess what he's still breathin'
You may think otherwise some say he's a success
Either way he just knows overall that he's been blessed
Who's the Chinese kid you already might have guessed
They say you live and you learn time to put it to the test

[Hook X3:]

[Verse 2:]
I know you got dreams that you been chasing for a long time
You been waiting but it starts to feel like such a long line
Before you know it it becomes a love hate relationship
Only just a few things that you can be so patient with ""
I can relate to it all I gotta say is have faith with it
Before homeplate you gotta hit first base with it
An opportunity is only what you make of it
Your birthday only comes once a year so have your cake with it
Other than that don't try to steal an extra slice
It ain't a million bucks but I offer you this advice
Don't ever take a handout why would you when you can stand out
If you can t build a sand castle start with a sand house
Work your way up from the bottom to the top
You'll never get there only if you stop
All I'm tryin to do now is give them
Somethin' they can feel
Malik said it best ""they can't deny it when it's real""

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with

She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

And tellin' every girl she the one for me

When the world seems to fall apart for us
When all the hope has turned to desperation
How can we torture, torture the ones that we Love
Can't let the feelings be left unsaid

How many hearts have been broken
How many have been broken in two
Cos a few simple words had not been spoken
Not been spoken, no, no, no
There's a need to know that we're wanted
That we're wanted yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a need to know you care
Need to know who cares for you yes we do",Howard Jones,1982,"[83, 65, 26, 26, 26, 30, 33, 34, 36, 46, 52, 56]",12
83,Southern Cross,"[Verse 1]
Got out of town on a boat, going to Southern islands
Sailing a reach before a following sea
She was making for the trades on the outside
And the downhill run to Papeete
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas
We got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten

[Chorus]
I have been around the world
Looking for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will

[Verse 2]
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
You understand now why you came this way
Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain
I have my ship and all her flags are a flying
She is all that I have left and music is her name

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So we cheated and we lied and we tested
And we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do
You will survive being bested
Somebody fine will come along, make me forget about loving you

84,Goodbye To You,"Those times that I waited for you seemed so long ago
I wanted you far too much to ever let you go
You know you never got by ""I feel it too""s
And I guess I never could stand to lose
It's such a pity to say goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

Could I have loved someone like the one I see in you?
I remember the good times, baby, now and the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, the nights are long
Guess it's better to say goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

'Cause baby, it's over now
No need to talk about it
It's not the same
My love for you's just not the same
And my heart, and my heart, and my heart won't stand the strain
And my love, and my love, and my love won't stand the pain
And my heart, and my heart, and my heart won't stand the strain
And my love, and my love, and my love...

Yeah
You might not like some of the things that I do
Or the things I say
But guarantee you, you gon' love me tomorrow
Fo' sho'

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
She love she love me not
But I never real touchy lovey dovey for what he got
Suddenly kissy huggy what is for me the buddy slot
But they callin' me to put it right in the open it could be an ugly stop
She's lookin' to be caressed on the reg
Fetched on the reg, sex on the reg
Only Techs on the bread
With nothin' but busting percussion and checks on the head
As she huffin' and puffin' 'cause wasn't no Tech on the bed
And she don't like that Tech N9ne persona
Groupies more groupies for true they be juicy like John Bedushi
Like the one that do movies, man ay caramba
You google me I'm beyond the boobies and champaignya
Bumbaclot don't shrug me 'cause I'm the rapper
But again you fond of da slacker who's been on your love
Peace in your honor, just trusting can calm ya
She stoned now I'm home but she gon' love me mañana

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Can't stand to hear my name or see my face
But every time she does she feels disgraced
But she gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
What kinda fan are you
Just because I expanded you ban a dude
Like I do soft musical Xanadu
But I'll be damn if you slander who Tech N9na
My crew cannibals ain't no fan of a true man
Who do a lot in a jam or two
Said I'm a sell out 'cause I worked with Wayne
First your brain needs work you hurt the game
Every lyric that we blurst put the earth to shame
How do we burst to fame if both of our verse the same
We supposed to be different, you know that we gifted
'Cause what we spit you know that we live it
We grow 'cause we vivid
You's a fair weather fan, your predictions will never stand
Like you know something better than when I'm chopping
Whatever man

[Spoken]
I told my fans, that, I told them this years ago. I said Tech will never go mainstream, mainstream will go Tech

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I hear ya saying that I ain't the same
But in order to grow you know you got to change
But you gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Here today but be gone when you blink an eye
Constant drinking got you thinking and you about cry
I was forsaken life taken can you feel the pain
Heart breakin' body shakin' can you stand the rain
I was a friend of thee but treated like an enemy
But now I'm gone just a portion of your memories
But in your memory 'member this vividly
There was no other villain from the hood real as me
From the soil none loyal like the B.I.G
Homie from the show me, hope that's how you 'member me
And we'll soon see I ain't got long to be
On this earth claiming turf running in these streets
I apologize homie look me in my eyes
Time to turn the page be a man and swallow pride
Too many homies died before I got to say my piece
So I just said my piece and hopin' that it brings us peace

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

But I'll be the sun shining on your face

Long as I can keep this feeling

Never took this road before

Won't be coming back this way
Gotta go it alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh

[Verse 2]
See a chance
Gotta take it
Wanna meet my fate
'Cause the last thing I ever wanted
Was to find out it's too late
No way out when you're in it
Deeper than the night
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
And I see it burning bright

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't matter where it takes me
Long as I can keep this feeling
Running through my soul

Never took this road before

Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah

But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now

One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

[Hook 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”

[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Hook 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')

[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too

Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!

You wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. These niggas is roaches. These niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals. I'm tryna push you to supreme bein'. You don't wanna motherfuckin'... You don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by
You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop

""Blast for me"" – the last words from my nigga
On the pavement, born killers, body shivers
Drug money, dollar figures
Hustlers movin' out of rentals, art of war is mental
Havin' sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
So it's bang, no survivors
Only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
Stalkin' niggas on their IG's, never; I be
Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno, we all we got the creed of Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and takin' their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine, until it's even: kill
Like I'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

Who can it be knocking at my door?
Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor
If he hears, he'll knock all day
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
I like it here with my childhood friend;
Here they come, those feelings again!

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Why do they follow me?

It's just my fantasy
Yeah!

My heart has been a chessboard
Making moves and losing out
Played so many times before
And there ain't nothing to brag about
But this must be a new brew
When you're gone I'm singing Blue Moon
You turn me all the way around
And I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
Be forever mine

Oh and there's nothing I can sing now
That ain't been sung before
Oh but your love is a standout
So go on ahead and take the floor
You had to Jimi my heart loose
Now I'm stuck in your voodoo
Pick me up, don't ever put me down
Look I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
I want you to be forever mine

[Bridge]
The way that you move, never seen it before
Looking for my head, can’t find it no more
You ransom my heart and I get the reward
Winning the crown like a Trojan horse
I come back, back, back every time
You got me shook like the Mobb when they rhyme
Come out of nowhere come blessing my life
I just want you to be forever mine, oh oh

[Chorus]
Be forever mine
Be forever mine

[Verse 3]
Oh but you was cookin' up a new stew
Must have put something in my food

The woe and grief
A final stride
Must confide

Leaves speechless on the floor

I think that I'm addicted to praying
Cause I finally found someone who understands what I'm saying
I don't have to be ashamed of who I am or how I feel just bein real when  I say I'm not embarrassed to say it
I look at other people, and I know we're not equal
But I just smile and get along because my pride can be lethal
Did I mention that I'm good at making illegal legal
I feel bad because you made me with these cool special features

Man I used be clumsy but I done learned how to juggle
The way I'm flexing my muscle it's getting hard to stay humble
I just jump over mountains like I don't know how to struggle
I'm talking climbing up easy like I was friends with Repunzel
Don't need a light in my tunnel
Because I know that you're with me
Every step by step RIP goes out to Whitney
Slow it down like in Houston
I hear some supporters rooting but none them gone take a bullet when these people start shooting
I just realized that I'm crazy I'd prolly crash a Mercedes
Just to prove to a nonbeliever Jesus Christ is the savior
I'm just tryna be apart do y'all accept behavior
I'm just tryna look apart I'll cut my face with a razor
Do I look good??
Wontchu come over for dinner don't I cook good?
Am I good enough do you like my neighborhood haaa?
Don't I fit the label good haaan or nah?

I'm so sophisticated, It's not the Jordan's man I worked to get this elevation
I'm tryna master every principle no limitation
I'm just tryna give my gift back to the creator
And ain't nobody have to teach me how to be creative
My mind is so amazing, should've of been in the matrix, I refuse to be basic
Do you think that I'm crazy, I'm tryna raise the ratings
Without having a baby, I'm the black power ranger
The things I used to like I don't enjoy em no mo
I got a new group friends I ain't lonely no mo
I finally met some people that are better than my equal, so now I can learn from them I'm not the coldest no mo
And since I'd rather hang with em old friends say that I'm distant
But you can't deny we ain't the same homies no more
I'm slayin dragons, I'm movin faster, I'm climb'n ladders, I'm sorry y'all I ain't ridin ponys no more

God you know I got issues, That involve repetition man I know she prolly mad cause I won't make the commitment
I'm really glad that you approve but we can't make it official
I'm just too afraid to lose and I refuse to need tissue
My cousin Dillon just died, car accident rocked him
And I hate it cause I wish somebody just woulda shot him
Man we coulda got the dude who did it just to say that we got him
I just need someone to blame I guess I do have a problem

In the wings

The merry dance she executes her role, role

110,I Wouldn't Beg For Water,"I make friends, I make enemies, it doesn't matter all that much to me
I'm not the kind who deals behind the scenes
I won't sell my soul, I'd be nothing without some integrity

I wouldn't beg for water, I wouldn't beg for water
If my soul was on fire, that's the last thing I would ever do
I wouldn't beg for water, I wouldn't beg for water
If my soul was on fire, but I'd get down on my knees for you

I've got pride, it's not the foolish kind
Don't owe people favours, that's my peace of mind
I don't know why I deserve someone like you
But you're my one and only sole exception to all my rules

Chorus

Real love is hard to find, as holding back the sands of time
And time can change my life as much as you

I wouldn't beg for water, I wouldn't beg for water

111,The One You Love,"I know you need a friend, someone you can talk to
Who will understand what you're going through
When it comes to love, there's no easy answer
Only you can say what you're gonna do

I heard you on the phone, you took his number
Said you weren't alone, but you'd call him soon
Isn't he the guy, the guy who left you cryin'?
Isn't he the one who made you blue?

When you remember those nights in his arms
You know you gotta make up your mind

Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you goin' back to the one you love?
Someone's gonna cry when they know they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above

What you gonna say when he comes over?
There's no easy way to see this through
All the broken dreams, all the disappointment
Oh girl, what you gonna do?

Your heart keeps sayin' it's just not fair
But still you gotta make up your mind

Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you goin' back to the one you love?

No sleep last night
Been dreaming of you
Please hold me tight
Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel

Deep in the night

113,Break It To Me Gently,"Did you think that your smile
Could hide what's on your mind?
No matter how I tried
I just couldn't be so blind
We've been close but people grow
And they sometimes grow apart
There's just one thing I ask you
If you've had a change of heart…

CHORUS:
(And)Break it to me gently
If ya have to, then tell me lies
Break it to me gently
At least leave me with my pride
Try to spare my feelings
If the feelings have to die
Break it to me gently
If you have to say goodbye

I'm not ashamed to admit
I really hurt inside
After all these are my feelings
Why should I make them hide?
But I won't hold you back
There'll be no pulling on your sleeve
Just let me down easy
And go softly when you leave…

CHORUS:
(And)Break it to me gently
If ya have to, then tell me lies
Break it to me gently
At least leave me with my pride
Try to spare my feelings
If the feelings have to die
Break it to me gently
If you have to say goodbye

You always knew that you had my heart
It's still yours, if you wanna take it
But when you go, as I know you must
Be gentle with your breaking

If ya have to, then tell me lies
Break it to me gently

He's a signal turning green

But you know he'll find a cure
He's cleaning up his systems
To keep his nature pure

Learning to match the beat of the Old World Man
Learning to catch the heat of the Third World Man

[Chorus 1]
He's got to make his own mistakes
And learn to mend the mess he makes

But young enough not to choose it
He's noble enough to win the world
But weak enough to lose it

He's a radio receiver
Tuned to factories and farms
He's a writer and a ranger
And a young boy bearing arms
He's got a problem with his power
With weapons on patrol
He's got to walk a fine line
And keep his self-control

Trying to save the day for the Old World Man
Trying to pave the way for the Third World Man

[Chorus 2]
He's not concerned with yesterday
He knows constant change is here today

But weak enough not to choose it
He's wise enough to win the world

Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends

""And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?""
So, I said...

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be

And then he asked me, he said
""Baby, why do we love each other?""
I said, ""Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother.""

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (if you go with me)
For life (see the world with me)

126,The Message,"[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[Refrain]
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

[Verse 2]
I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up

[Refrain 2]
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo

Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia

Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'

Touch of your skin blurring my vision
Seeing the same film again
Closer you pull me under the table
Sign of how this might end

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you don't want to hold me
Maybe I could change your mind
Cause I'm waiting
Hesitating
And there's other ways to leave you
But I've only asked for you
As you move your body next to me
There's so much more to lose

Honey, you talk, talk
All you wanna do is talk, talk
All I wanted was, all I wanted was
All I wanted was your reconcile

Lean in to kiss you, push me away
Carving my name on your wall

Have you ever had the feeling
That we're not alone?
All the calls I’ve been receiving
They are not from home
Going down the dusty roads
We couldn’t see through
I need you

There’s a reading on the wall
Of all the things that I have done
And we’re leaving it all
Run away, take my my hand

130,The Only Way Out,"[Verse 1]
If you could look inside my life
And use my eyes, would you pity me?
Would you see the desperate nights
And all the lies that brought me to my knees
I keep thinking that I have to make you fall
The way I fell from your betrayal to bring me peace of mind
I will let you move along, just walk away
And wear a cape like you're some hero

[Chorus]
I can't hear love cause we're at war
And revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
But oh, I'm in a cage and I hear mercy say ""I'm here now""
And it's the only way out
I can't hear love cause we're at war
But revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
But I'm still in a cage and I hear mercy say now
It's the only way out

[Verse 2]
I used to hear my father say, ""Counterplay ends in defeat""
And I said I'd never be that way
Tried to make you pay cause it would cost me
But you owe me so much more than what you gave to this
I guess every story twists
People tell me let it go, oh, and forget

[Chorus]
I can't hear love cause we're at war
And revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
But oh, I'm in a cage and I hear mercy say ""I'm here now""
And it's the only way out
I can't hear love cause we're at war
But revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
But I'm still in a cage and I hear mercy say now
It's the only way

132,Eye Of The Tiger,"[Verse 1]
Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop

133,Close Enough To Perfect,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes the morning coffee's way too strong
And sometimes what she says she says all wrong
Right or wrong, she's there beside me like only a friend would be
And that's close enough to perfect for me

[Verse 2]
Now she's been known to wear her pants too tight
And drinking puts her out just like a light
Heaven knows she's not an angel but she'd really like to be
And that's close enough to perfect for me

[Chorus]
She kisses me each morning and smiles a sleepy smile
She don't have to say it, I can see it in her eyes
Don't you worry about my woman and what you think she ought to be
She's close enough to perfect for me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes she gets down and starts to cry
But then again a lady has a right
She's everything I've ever wanted, she's all I'll ever need
She's close enough to perfect for me

She kisses me each morning and smiles a sleepy smile
She don't have to say it, I can see it in her eyes

134,Tug Of War,"[Verse 1]
Mama praying for me, grandma praying for me
Satan preying on me, Jesus waiting on me
Cause I been straddling the fence, it’s time to make decisions
I been thinking ‘bout heaven lately, don’t think I’ll get in
Cause I been going back and forth I love the way I’m living
But I hate it at the same time cause I know I’m sinning
And I don’t wanna be like them hypocritical Christians
So I stay away from Jesus completely ‘til I’m ready to give Him
Everything, but that seems like it’ll never happen
My girl coming over later, you know what’s about to happen
Then after smashing I’m sitting there asking
If eternity in Hell is worth some moments of your satisfaction
Man I’m so back and forth

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Back and forth like a tug of war (yeah)
Cause I’ve been fighting for my life like
Tryna get my life right
And I really want more
I don’t know, back and forth like a tug of war
And I been fighting for control and fighting for my soul and
This is war, it’s a tug of war

[Verse 2]
I got two choices, both require pain
One’s the pain of change and the pain of staying the same
One of ‘em leads to joy, other one leads to shame
One of ‘em leads to freedom, the other keeps me in chains
I wear a cross and give You thanks for my blessings, ain’t that enough?
Why you want everything? Can’t you leave this part of my life untouched?
I thought following You meant I only had to say yes once
Now everyday I wake up You give me some cross to take up
You really want me to break up with my girl? Nah that’s too much
I know what’s best for me, You don’t understand my complexities
See, I gotta make a living so don’t ask where my checks come from
I hear You talking, I ain't gone numb
I know I’m in the dark and I gotta find my way to the Son
Cause You’re calling on my name and I know I can’t run
But I feel so back and forth

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Back and forth like a tug of war (yeah)
Cause I’ve been fighting for my life like
Tryna get my life right
And I really want more
I don’t know, back and forth like a tug of war
And I been fighting for control and fighting for my soul and
This is war, it’s a tug of war

[Verse 3]
A trail of broken hearts, a man full of regrets
The thrill has left, the empty promises of sin sets
You wanna put treasure inside my hands but You cease
Cause they’re clamped, holding on to sins I won’t release
I don’t know how to start loving You and stop doing what I’m doing
If I gain You tell me what I’m really losing
You have to change me in my sin, I never choose Him
My heart needs to see something greater than what I’m pursuing so
Is it true that You give rest to the weary?
Can you accept and repair me, do you hear me?
It’s so clearer now, it’s painfully apparent that I can’t have my sin and my Savior, they’re not for sharing
Anything that I lose to follow you is not a loss
My girlfriend, my friends, my money, even my job
But sometimes I believe the lie
That God don’t provide for His child when they obey, that’s so cray
You calling me to freedom, I think that it’s time to walk
I don’t see every step but the next is out of the dark
I’m the filthiest of them all but I’m Yours if you wash me
From that sin by the blood of that cross, I’m yours",Andy Mineo,1982,"[95, 94, 85, 53, 53, 58, 64, 75]",8

I have to find the strength to let you know
I will be the one to let this go

Right here, and now
We come to grips in this moment
The sky is falling around us
Right here and now it's over
Can we all run for cover?

In this breath I feel alive
The weight now lifted, I am ready
You can keep the things you took from me

139,Hold On,"[Verse 1]
Loving and fighting
Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Verse 2]
Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

Buried in the past, so many moments I want back
Tomorrow doesn't hurt until yesterday

[Chorus 1]
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Show me what we've got to lose
Don't hide it, don't hide it
Memories stuck in my head
All the things I should have said
If I fall back into you
Don't fight it, don't fight it

[Verse 2]
I wanna know after all these lessons learned
If there's a road from these bridges the we burned
I need to know if you still want me
Want me to show how much I need you

Gone are all of the days when this was easy

Pas de fils de putes, ni enfants de putains sur ma guest list
Pour m’endormir, je compte les diamants sur ma Breitling
Dans mon équipe, y'a pas de fumistes
Le gang est unique, sunnite, c’est 9.2.I. pas G-Unit
Izi monnaie, izi life
Oui, tu nous connais, frais, izi nice
Je voyage beaucoup, Flying Blue, j’ai des Miles
Boss du rap game, j’veux le cheese à Mickey Mouse
La France est archi bonne
Mon âme toujours au tier-quar comme un taxiphone
J’raconte beaucoup de de-mer comme un tas d’ivrognes
Trop, trop de punchlines, le rap à Parkinson

Tu veux de la 0.9, des pilules ? OK

Dans l’estomac j’ai des MCs, des juges, des cuisses de pollos

Atteindre mon niveau n’est même pas une possibilité
T’as rien dans le cerveau comme la police de proximité
Là d’où je viens, on choisit la facilité
Comme dans GTA, code crédit illimité
Du shit pour qu’on tienne, j’rappe sans thème
Rêvant des billets verts et violets par centaines
Mademoiselle c’est pour ton cul, ta chatte qu’on t’aime
B.2.O.B.A. j’ai plus de flow qu’une femme fontaine

149,Tainted Love,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

[Verse 2]
Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

[Chorus]
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

[Outro]
Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love, oh, tainted love, oh

You should break the ice
Let her know that she's on your mind
What you trying to hide
When you know inside
She's the best thing you'll ever find
Ah, can't you see it
Don't you think she's feeling the same
Ah, I guarantee it
She's the one that's calling your name

Chorus:
You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she said
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head
You should hear how she talks about you
She just can't get enough
She says she would be lost without you
She is really in love

I ain't telling tales
Anybody else could repeat the things that I've heard
She's been talking sweet and it's on the street
How our girlfriend's spreading the word
Ah, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ah, now don't you worry
If you know the story's for real

Repeat first half of the Chorus

You should hear how she talks about you
She is really in love

Ah, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ah, now don't you worry

I wanted a future with her
And it was very easy for me to get used to her
We went to the movies, everything was groovy
We started spendin time and it was like she already knew me
We spent more time, then everything was fine
I kicked it to her how since she kicked it to mine
I called her up at work and even met her downtown
Keen to knowin one another, yo, I thought that I'd found
The perfect match for me, this just has to be
Asked her what's up with you and me?
She said she wanted to be friends with me
So I took it like a man
I couldn't understand why she wouldn't take my hand
And let me take her on a trip
She's a cute honey dip
It make her feel real good when I start to kiss her lips

Later on that night I decided to call her up
She was on the other line, she say hold on and hung up
With the person she was talkin to so she could talk to me
That was a sign that she was with it, it was time to drop some g
So I laid down with my eyes closed and kicked the Willie Bobo
And talked to her all night because I took a couple of No Doze
The next day came, I heard a knock-knock-kknock
I had on shorts and no shirts, so I unlocked the lock
She came in and sat down and we got right to it

She said she wasn't ready and this I couldn't understand

Consumed by the fire in your eyes

Stepped in and shattered my defenses
Just playing hookey with my heart
Slipped through my window by the back door
And took the keys to my poor heart
Yes my poor heart

Try as I might
Try as I may
Yes I'll try anything to make you stay
Cause I need your love
Yes I need you love

178,Even The Nights Are Better,"I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong, why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused, feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me

I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you

You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better

And your problems are eating your time

Kick it ! The treacherous rat who is stealing your future away

From the city lights to Valhalla’s fires
Count me in I’m still in the game

Skate that shit it’s time to ignite
No pain, no gain, we destroy - not entertain
Start a band and join the good fight
Grab it ! Your life by the throat it is yours to live day by day
Kick it ! The treacherous rats who are stealing your future away

I raise the dead with a forbidden chant
Backhand slap you to life, bred, born, left, fed, suffocated, backstabbed, blood red

I can see my life before me
Running rings around the way
It used to be
I am older now
I have more than what I wanted
But I wish that I had started
Long before I did

And there's so much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
Oh when you were young
Did you question all the answers
Did you envy all the dancers
Who had all the nerve
Look round you know
You must go for what you wanted
Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved

And there's so much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
And there's so much love to make up

Take back what you said
Can't lose what you never had

192,She Looks A Lot Like You,"Years, days, makes no difference to me, babe
You look exactly the same to me
Ain’t no time, crossing your legs inside the diner
Raising your coffee to your lips, the steam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

You whisper to a restless ear, “can you get me out of here?
This place smells like piss and beer, can you get me out?”
You were asking me how to get you free
I only know the recipe to roam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old stars filling up my throat
You gave em to me when I was born, now they’re coming out
Laying there on the hospital bed, eyes were narrow, blue and red
You took a draw of breath and said to me

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like me
Wrapping my left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old friends, old mothers, dogs and brothers
There’s only so much letting go you can ask someone to do
So I keep you by my side, I will not give you to the tide
I'll even walk you in my stride, Marie

One man that you are looking at
No, no

I swear I'd be a better man
If roses and daises won't do the trick
I'll create another perfect plan
I swear to the heavens I'll forget all the past

One man that you won't write back

You are looking east with the heaviest heart
That I can ever recall seeing
Time is not the answer you wanted

197,Themes From E.T. (The Extra-Terrestrial),"When people think of science fiction, their mind often turns to one of two things: either campy B-movies featuring outlandish creatures and damsels in distress; or CGI-filled summer blockbusters that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make. Either way‚ people believe sci-fi is a genre where spectacle is emphasised over story. That is not the case‚ nor has it ever been. Science fiction is a genre that uses scientific elements to explore the what-ifs of our world‚ allowing us to peel back the façade and examine our definitions of society and humanity.

Generally considered the first science fiction film, Georges Méliès’ Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon) involved a group of astronomers landing on the moon and meeting its alien inhabitants. It introduced some of the most common elements of science fiction, both in setting (space or another planet) and character (extraterrestrials). In the hundred-plus years since Méliès’ 1902 film‚ these components have been used and reused countless times. George Lucas’ 1975 space epic Star Wars (and its ten-plus sequels and prequels) became the most well-known entry into the science fiction genre. Extraterrestrials both malicious and benign have been notably featured in Alien, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Men in Black. Outer space can be used as a positive or negative context‚ as a final frontier to explore (Star Trek) or an isolated wasteland to be stuck in (Duncan Jones’ Moon).

The next major innovation came in Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, a dystopian film that used science fiction as a way for viewers to reflect upon themes like class, wealth, and status. The George Orwell’s novel 1984 and its subsequent movie adaptation used some of those themes, along with a greater message of government control, to create a chilling cautionary tale. Neill Blomkamp’s District 9, released in 2009, viewed classism and poverty through the lens of an extraterrestrial family living in South Africa. Metropolis spawned a genre of intellectual, belief-driven, political sci-fi films, which are often disregarded in favour of the pulpy sci-fi that dominated the 1950s.

Them! and Creature from the Black Lagoon introduced movie audiences to strange creatures in their sci-fi (like giant ants and sea monsters, respectively). The Japanese interpretation of “monster movie” saw Ishirō Honda create Godzilla, which would spawn 33 sequels, remakes, and spin-offs. Director Guillermo Del Toro, known for his science-fiction and fantasy films, has a penchant for misunderstood beasts of all sorts. 2013’s sci-fi action movie Pacific Rim was an ode to these movies, blending American and Asian influences. Del Toro’s latest film, The Shape of Water, was a loose reinterpretation of Creature from the Black Lagoon that garnered 13 Academy Award nominations. Some were truly ridiculous movies, while others, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, used monsters as a metaphor for Cold War-era paranoia. The introduction of outlandish beings enticed mainstream audiences to the genre; like sugar to make medicine go down, the sensationalism often masked deeper intellectual themes.

Arrival is a 2017 film by Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. After twelve mysterious spaceships land in locations around the world, linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is called upon by the U.S. government to decipher the alien species’ language. Arrival mixed “hard” science fiction concepts with compelling performances, an equation that resulted in universal critical acclaim (including eight Oscar nominations). It starts off with a sci-fi trope dating back to Le Voyage dans la Lune: humans confirm the existence of aliens, but do they have good or bad intentions? The beginning of the movie is rather formulaic--the scientists want to study the alien beings, the government wants to wage war on them, and our trusty protagonist believes there’s more to them than meets the eye.

But unlike other sci-fi movies, Arrival stands out for its intimate, intellectual plot and exceptional technical elements. Villeneuve teamed up with cinematographer Bradford Young to create a “dirty sci-fi film” that wasn’t “concerned with straight lines or the perfectly textured alien or the perfectly modeled ship” (Minoff, 2016). The aliens and their ships look real and raw and biological, unlike the futuristic, pristine aesthetic found in Star Trek or even Wall-E. In fact, Arrival doesn’t take place two thousand years in the future, or in a galaxy far, far away. The movie takes place here and now, with Banks standing in as a proxy for the audience; when she shows up at the impromptu military base erected around the alien ship, she’s just as disoriented as we are. Villeneuve walks a fine line as Banks wavers between what she understands and what she’s utterly oblivious about. In a genre known for its lack of gender representation, Louise Banks is a female character who’s not constantly bamboozled by her male colleagues’ scientific ramblings. She may not understand every concept aired by her scientist co-workers or the ever-present government personnel, but her ignorance serves the story; it creates confusion as she navigates this new environment. Banks is a genius in her own right, in her own field, with concepts and theories that leave her (mostly male) co-workers in the dust. In fact, she is the key to deciphering the alien language and the solution to their problems. In a room full of men, this woman holds the fate of the world in her hands.

Blade Runner is a 1982 film by American director Ridley Scott. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a “blade runner”, a cop who must hunt rogue androids, known as Replicants. At its release, it polarised critics and audiences alike. Supporters praised its philosophical approach and unique visuals. Detractors disliked its slow, unorthodox pacing, and ambiguous ending. After the success of Star Wars, studios saw the benefit in blockbuster sci-fi franchises that would perform well at the box office. Audiences became accustomed to the fast-paced, action-driven sci-fi of the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. Blade Runner differed from any other science fiction movie at the time, which led to lower-than-forecasted box office returns. In 1982, sci-fi relied on special effects (Tron), heartfelt story (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial), or horror (The Thing). Blade Runner interpreted familiar science fiction components, like flying cars, robots, and artificial intelligence, and portrayed them in a totally different way.

Despite the initial reaction, Blade Runner has been since hailed as one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. Its topics and technical elements have nearly spawned an entirely new genre. The synth-driven soundtrack, endlessly dark and rainy climate, dystopian cityscape, and themes of humanity, morality, and corporate greed have become hallmarks of the “cyberpunk” subgenre. Blade Runner inspired and influenced cyberpunk classics like RoboCop, Ghost in the Shell, and The Matrix, as well as countless TV shows, video games, and songs. Ridley Scott took a chance when he created Blade Runner, something movie audiences had never seen before. His gamble paid off, and we have a new genre because of it.

Genre can help classify films by giving them concrete labels to adhere to. When we laugh, it’s a comedy. When we cry, it’s a drama. When we see an alien, it’s sci-fi. It gives audiences a clear idea of what to expect from a movie. But it also limits filmmakers in how they can express themselves. Genre forces movies into neat little boxes, or at least tries to. Film is a reflection and an imitation of life, which never fits into one category or another. Movies that encompass multiple genres are more interesting, because they are unpredictable--anything can happen, or at least more things can happen that one genre would allow. When film is treated more like a business than an art, conformity to genre is prioritised over storytelling. But when filmmakers are allowed to tell thought-provoking stories unlimited by the bounds of genre, in the case of Blade Runner and Arrival, true works of art can emerge.",Audrey Xuan,1982,"[95, 86, 47, 48, 52, 59, 69, 76, 85]",9

Been in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, trainin' up

We off the shits, purple weed, I call it Prince
Catch me drippin' in some Tommy Hilfiger or some Ralph Lauren
My mental state is Professor Charles Xavier
They can hardly lift the mic but for me, that shit is weightless
I was destined for greatness because I put in the work
This for the kids in they bedroom who just don't know what they worth, yo
""Who the fuck is Oliver?"" Bitch, you ain't heard of him?
He'll stick the microphone through a rapper like shuriken
Yeah, we four deep in the Camry
I flew my team to Miami, that's word to grandpa and daddy
I realized that I can never trade this quiet life for hedonism
How do these rappers sleep at night with the way they be living?
Teaching kids that poppin' percocets and fuckin' bitches
All there is to do in the short amount of time that we given

Sippin' out a coconut and chillin' on the sand
Prolly rollin' through my city while I'm thumbin' through a band
Man, these artificial limbs, they got me stronger than ever
I'd tear you rappers to shreds if I wanted, whenever
Ripped knees on my Polo jeans, flannels like its '93
Smoking good weed up on the beach under the palm trees
Graffiti streets, broken glass, and concrete
Why you lil' rappers always gots to beef with OG's?
Now we on the top floor, that's the presidential suite, yo
Nikes On My Feet, that made my cypher complete
Sometimes I rap 'cause I love it, sometimes I rap for the hell of it
Personality split like Mr. Robot and Elliot, yeah
My mic check leave you wet like a TEC
Tryna keep the Reaper off me, crucifix on my neck, yo
Yeah, that's word to Weezy F. Baby

Bulletproof glass on a G-Class 'Cedes
I'ma do me 'til the day I push daisies

So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife

Well she said she would
So I said ""I do""
But I'da said ""I wouldn't""
If I'da just knew how sayin' ""I do""
Was gonna screw up all of my life

Well the first few years weren't all that bad
I'll never forget the good times we had
Cause I'm reminded every month when I send her the child support

Well it wasn't too long till the lust all died
And I'll admit I wasn't too surprised
The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch

Well I tried to get in
She changed the lock
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said
""Goodbye turkey. My attorney will be in touch"" Mhmm

So I decided right then and there
I was gonna do what's right
Give 'er her fair share
But brother
I didn't know her share was gonna be that much

She got the goldmine (She got the goldmine)

Why they give her the color televison set
Then they give her the house
The kids
And both of the cars

And the costs to the court
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was

Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes

They give me the shaft (I got the shaft)

212,Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing/You're All I Need To Get By,"Much of the significant truth about the career of the Afro-American singer Marvin Gaye may be obscured by the problems of his later life and the manner of his dying (he was shot to death by his father April 1, 1984, in a tragic, and as yet unexplained, incident).

First and foremost, Gaye was a Christian artist. He was also one of the most gifted performers produced by the Afro-American religious experience. Raised in his father's Pentecostal church, located in the East Capitol projects in Washington, D.C., Gaye was imbued with a deep spiritual sensitivity anchored in a Christ-centered ethic of love. Initially this sensitivity was expressed in his instrumental virtuosity -- especially on the organ, piano, and drums. Althought Gaye sang in the church choir, his vocal talent did not surface until he filled the first-tenor slot of Harvey Fuqua's Moonglows, a smooth-harmony rhythm and blues group. When Gaye's silky and soulful voice caught the attention of Berry Gordy, Jr. -- the founder of Motown Recording Company -- in a Detroit nightclub in 1961, he was immediately offered a contract. The public career of Marvin Gaye had begun.

Motown was the Jackie Robinson of black popular music: after crossing the color line it its field, it went on to excel and to win the hearts of vast numbers of nonblack Americans. As with other Motown stars -- Diana Ross, Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson -- Gaye's relationship with Motown enabled his talent to become visible to the world. Unlike those other artists, Gaye's musical and philosophical roots remained in the Afro-American Christian tradition. His first classic recordings were neither adolescent, rhythmic dance records (as with the Supremes and the Jackson Five) nor funky rock renderings (as with Lionel Richie's Commodores). Rather, Gaye's great early achievements -- sung with the incomparable Tammi Terrell -- were poignant and powerful love songs, written by the team of Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson of White Rock Baptist Church in New York City. These classics -- such as ""Your Precious Love,"" ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing,"" ""You're All I Need to Get By"" and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" -- were the pivotal songs that directed the Christian relgiosity of black church music into the secular spirituality of Afro-American popular music. For the first time in American history, the musical depth of the black church was let loose into the mainstream of American society. And American popular music would never again be the same.

Upon the tragic death of Tammi Terrell, who collapsed in Gaye's arms during a performance in 1967, Gaye went into hiding. Despite his success as a solo performer (""I'll Be Doggone,"" ""Ain't That Peculiar,"" and ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" all reached the Top Ten), Gaye became reclusive, melancholic and deeply dissatisfied with his music. He would not perform publicly for five years.

""WHAT'S GOING ON""

Yet Gaye's tortuous struggle with the sudden death of Tammi Terrell, his younger brother Frankie's firsthand accounts of atrocities in Vietnam, the escalation of the civil rights movement into black power advocacy, the widespread invasion of drugs among unemployed black youth and the rise of ecological consciousness produced the greatest album in Afro-American popular music: What's Going On (1971). This groundbreaking album was not only the first conceived and enacted by the artist (as opposed to studio staffers), but also the first concept album that hung together by means of a set of themes -- themes concerned with socio-economic critique and Christian outlook.

Gaye's critique of American society was explicit. ""Rockets, moon shots,"" he wrote in ""Inner City Blues,"" ""Spend it on the have-nots."" With ""radiation underground and in the sky,"" he saw birds and animals dying in ""Mercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology)."" Instead of brutality, he asked attention: ""Talk to me, so you can see"" (""What's Going On""). And in such songs as ""Save the Children,"" ""God Is Love"" and ""Wholly Holy,"" he explicitly evoked the love ethic of Jesus Christ as the basis for negating and transforming the world: If we learn from the book jesus left us, we can rock the world, we can ""holler love across the nation.""

What's Going On was the peak of Gaye's career. He continued to produce popular albums and hits. Yet, principally owing to two painful divorces, Oedipal obsessions, paranoiac fits and suicidal impulses, Gaye became captive to a form of bondage he admonished others to avoid: drugs. His songs still portrayed a longing for transcendence, but instead of the agapic praxis of communities he highlighted erotic communion -- as in his albums Let's Get It On (1973) and I Want You and his Grammy Award single ""Sexual Healing"" (1982).

In his last years, Gaye oscillated between earthly pessimism and eschatological hope: from the notion that nuclear holocaust was imminent to a faith that only Jesus can save us. During his sporadic bouts with suicide, Gaye is reported to have viewed Jesus and sins that would never be forgiven as the primary motivations to live. And, at the height of this turmoil, the last words he wrote for his laste album, Midnight Love (1982), were ""I still love Jesus, all praises to the Heavenly Father."" May this troubled musical genius, deeply immersed in the Afro-American religious experience and genuinely sensitive to the harsh realities of American society, rest in peace. And may his artistic Christian witness live forever.",Dr. Cornel West,1982,"[88, 88, 88]",3

When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new

Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me

You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

[Pre-Chorus: Philip]
Don't, don't you want me?

How did he get to you
Who were those other strangers
What did they make you do
Where was their party from
You with that number one
How could you feel so high
Just living a lie

I really don't need your love to see me through, no
I really don't need your heart to set me free
I really don't need the way it used to be, oh

Come down--you never come down--you never come down

Back street boy gonna sell you some sin
He'll wind you up--he gonna suck you in

The voice in your ear say you go - go - go
Run down--you really run down--you really run down
Cool down--you never cool down--you better cool down

Emotions in motion

Give yourself to a life of extremes
You're into the action--it's a part of your dream
Now there're some things you never can tell
But when the door lies open throw your coins in the well
Get down--you really get down--you really get down
Right now--you want it right now--hold tight now

And walk away if you choose to
I want you to stay

229,Do I Do,"[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise

I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you...

230,Seasons Of The Heart,"Of course we have our differences
You shouldn't be surprised
It's as natural as changes
In the seasons and the skies
Sometimes we grow together
Sometimes we drift apart
A wiser man than I might know
The seasons of the heart

And I'm walking here beside you
In the early evening chill
A thing we've always loved to do
I know we always will
We have so much in common
So many things we share
That I can't believe my heart
When it implies that you're not there

Love is why I came here in the first place
Love is now the reason I must go
Love is all I ever hoped to find here
Love is still the only dream I know

So I don't know how to tell you
It's difficult to say
I never in my wildest dreams
Imagined it this way
But sometimes I just don't know you
There's a stranger in our home
When I'm lying right beside you
Is when I'm most alone

And I think my heart is broken
There's an emptiness inside
So many things I've longed for
Have so often been denied
Still I wouldn't try to change you
There's no one that's to blame
It's just some things that mean so much
And we just don't feel the same

Love is why I came here in the first place
Love is now the reason I must go
Love is all I ever hoped to find here
Love is still the only dream I know
True love is still the only dream I know",John Denver,1982,"[99, 78, 82, 84, 88]",5

And I said here I go
I found somebody
I found somebody to love
I found somebody
I found somebody to love

I'd seen so much deceivin'
I almost stopped believin'
I'd ever fall in love again
I was runnin' around hidin' my heart
Fakin' it with all of my friends
I was down on my luck
That's when you came along
You put me back on my feet
You got me singin' this song

I found somebody
I found somebody to love
I found somebody
I found somebody to love
And she loves me in the midnight hour

You know ever since I found you
And put my arms around you
I don't need a doggone thing
You know that ev'ry day is such a beautiful day
I want the whole world to dance and sing
So don't you dare hang your head
Don't you dare be blue

It can happen to you

What kind of fool am I, who never fell in love?
It seems that I'm the only one that I have been thinking of
What kind of life is this, an empty shell?
A lonely cell in which an empty heart must dwell
What kind of lips are these, that lied with every kiss?
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this

Why can't I fall in love like other people can?
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am

You say I'm out of line
But this life is only mine

The feelings all combine
Enough is enough, enough is enough

Your love, he departed
Yes if you think your love’s not on a shelf -
Girl, you’re only foolin' yourself

Well you can cheat, drink and lie
Stay gone all night
And at the end of the day
Tell yourself it’s alright

..A little too fast
(Too fast)
Here we go, uh

[Verse: Blu]
Kissed her on the cheek said peace
Each and every week no sleep
Just dream states, far fantasies
Far fetched catches, stretching the galaxies
I asked her if she like the pasture
Where flowers bloom under grass skirts
Candle lit cancer sticks, casual cannabis
Can a bliss be so simple?
Sanitize samples that vandalize vandals
Caught them on the beach, eating peaches, rocking sandals
Passed them pamphlets, pleasant passed her
Ayo I asked her, if she liked the pasture
Sun bathed and pampered
Of course she declined, lying yes, like a lioness
Maintained, maintain bed frame
Under the summer dress, tasting like rain
Spring and December when I enter
Stolen pictures, posing pain
Open to it, she knew it but he blew it
Or vice-versa, might church
Worshiping the first bit of bliss abysses
Similar to this, wish, wonder and write
Fly kites to the mistress filling my nights the right way I say
Touch and tangle like the tango
Sippin mango on that same old, same old plain Joe
Jane Birkin put in work and worth more then purses
Pushing hearses since the first kiss
And between sheets, said peace
Each and every week no sleep
Dream states, far fantasies
Far fetched catches, stretching the galaxies
I asked her if she like the pasture
Pierced ears with the atmospheres ring around
Sat her down on Saturn, put the single out
Singing bout the last time I had her
Falling in love, calling me up
Darlin we was so marvelous lust, so starving to bust, trust God is in us
Was offering love, but now Im offering what
What a difference a day makes, age old playmate
Smoking on a cig, taking lame breaks
Lavish life, later wait till the day dawning on

258,Street Corner,"[Produced by Bronze Nazareth]

[Intro: sample (Inspectah Deck)]
Looking on various street corners
I'm sure you've seen it yourself
Standing on the corner, is an alleged brother
Dressed in blue, or green, red and black
And starting the news, that the revolution is coming
And you better get ready, sort of like (I feel you, son)
The end of the world is coming, unfortunately (I got you, though)
The world is just gonna drag on and on (I know how it is)
And we have a poem that we've written particularly (I said, I know how it is)
For the brothers on the street corners

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
When the revolution come, you can see me on the front line
Firing my gun, standing right beside my son
If I go, it's understood that I stood for something
When my whole life, they told me, I was good for nothing
I was raised by the stray dogs, blazed off, layed off
Breaking laws, graveyard shifting every day war
Focus now, notice how, things change, soldier
I remain the same, I'm older now, I embrace the pain
I blame the struggle, nearly drove me insane
Thought I lost my head, till my brethren told me the same
No tears for the reaper, I've buried bout a thousand
In graffiti, ""rest in peace"" sprayed off throughout the housing
I tried to stay civilized, the hood's a prison inside
The only difference is the doors don't slide
Still we trapped in the animal cage, cause we got animal ways
So we react, with the animal rage
And my section's real, weapons peel, cheddar's the deal
Seen the depths of hell, now I stare, death in the grill
From the slave ships, to today's bricks, same shit
I'm awake, to the wickedness, and one, with the pavement

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
The all great mind stays divine, my hands remain deadly
We shine without the hung jewelry, produce light
That'll travel through mics, now as the time riping
We took words that we nourishing, encouraging
A nation to awaken, those who were sleeping
Can you conceive the thought? Transatlantic import
Slave and bought, secret relations between blacks and Jews
Might set a fuse off in the head
Many dead lynch hung, swung from trees
Brothers in the struggle together, eat from one pot
Hold each other down to the sneaker
Nothing come between us
Fast money and chicks, did it to the best of cliques
It's sickening... huh

[Hook: Masta Killa]
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
...For a better tomorrow
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
...For a better tomorrow

[Verse 3: GZA]
I catch a few flashbacks about, going through the struggle
How we used to make dollars, from all the snow we shoveled
In a broke neighborhood, where the kids often dream
About a lavish life, that is mostly seen in the screen
Where some dreams are quickly cut short, due to gang violence
From loud guns, that kept witnesses, in deep silence
Was it bad timing? Jealousy from too much shining?
Or a set up, from a girl that he wined, kept dining
It's a known fact, they will attack, cause it's like that
And depending on the, kind of impact, that strike back
In a town where the talk is cheap and, beef is brief
A mother sobs uncontrollably, and exhibit the grief
Large holes in the front door, of a housing tenement
Allows room to retaliate, so conflict is imminent
This hate in the brain, destroys the cells like cancer
Even experts are stuck with more questions than answers",Masta Killa,1982,"[100, 92, 56, 57, 58, 60, 69, 74, 81, 85]",10

263,Angel In Blue,"We met in a bar
Out on Chesapeake Bay
With her white patent boots
And her blouse red lame
A table top dancer
She would smile on cue
Those lips of an angel
Angel in blue

She's been dancing for ages
Though cities of bars
She was kickin' the habit
Of scoring in cars
She'd been drained of her spirit
All caged in this zoo
A wildcat angel
Angel in blue

And as she stared out into nowhere
I thought, yes, I thought she might break down and cry
When I whispered I thought I could love her
She just said ""Baby, don't even bother to try""

And I watched as she spoke
Her words chilled my bones
All her friends did her favors
That were really just loans
And she never had dreams
So they never came true
The palest of angels
Angel in blue

And the bees they had stung her
The birds they had flown
There were guys she could number
But none she had known
And she never had dreams
So they never came true
My fade away angel

And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmmmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too

Well, I've been afraid of changing

Sober, you never should be
Shit faced, now and forever

Cause dreaming only makes me blue
I've got to get too drunk to dream

I've got to drink wine not to pine for you

271,After The Glitter Fades,"[Verse 1]
Well I never thought I'd make it
Here in Hollywood
I never thought I'd ever want to stay
What I seem to touch these days
Has turned to gold
What I seem to want
Well you know I'll find a way

[Chorus]
For me, it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one
Fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades

[Verse 2]
The loneliness of a one night stand
Is hard to take
We all chase something
And maybe this is a dream
The timeless face of a rock and roll woman
While her heart breaks
Oh you know, the dream keeps coming
Even when you forget to feel

[Chorus]
For me, it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one
Fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
For me it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains

Oh you know the feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades
Oh the feeling remain
Even after the glitter fades",Stevie Nicks,1982,"[93, 63, 57, 32, 33, 35, 37, 41, 48, 57, 73]",11

Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin' Outlaw
That's right nigga, hahaha.. housin' these hoes, you feel me?
Aight, you know what I'm sayin'?
You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?
Keepin' it real!
How old are you nigga?
I'm eleven

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryna survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we been through
Witnessin' evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'
Pull 'n' fuckin' fire when I leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

[Hook]
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?
High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive
By makin' motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop
Got no time for the court, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin', an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a

Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggas lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest

[Kastro]
So I just ... swallow my Beck's and holla, ""Fuck 'em!""
And if I'm next ... just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin' nuttin'

[EDI Amin(Kastro)]
Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me
(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin'

[Napoleon]
Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' 'bout prayin'

They need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggas sprayin' up my block

Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggas run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin' but muuuusic

The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets

But all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's

Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger

Niggas growing up, bout get blown up
Working on the music stuff, mixtape going hard tho
Calling shooters yo, pull up wit the squad
You already know
Living solo, living life, pull up to the crib
Slipping the liq, looking at the brick, I don't smoke
But I'm fucking yo ex
Shit I might be the next (yea)
Rap game had me going all out
Trying to be myself, I'm solo for a reason
This is my season to shine
I could get everything that can be mine
Let's take it back to time, I wasn't a nobody
Growing up to become anybody
Music career got me hyped
This activity got me paranormal
Called a saint like I went global
Living the life, reading a noble
Everything was understandable, I'm killing the throne
Looking up in the sky, seeing a drone, man wasn't even known
Chillin at the crib, busting the rhymes
It's about time, shooting the Glock, kicking the stock
Pull up wit the squad, coming to the block, giving up my lock
I'm a bomb going tick-tock
Writing this shit down, thinking Ima clown
Nigga got a frown, I'm the king, where's my crown
Living in a kingdom, work hard
Rapping like I'm a god
Can't handle me is like your the fish hooked up on my rod
Making big bands out here
I need to be in the stands, spitting my rhymes
Never catching theses hands
Don't come back to my motherfucking land

281,I've Never Been To Me,"Hey, lady, you, lady
Cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife

I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

Ooohooo, I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun

But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Please, lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today

I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives

Oh, I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got

I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to see
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places as we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet

I've spent my life exploring, the subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free, hey, lady
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

I've been to paradise
Never been to me

I've been to Georgia and California

282,When It's Over,"[Verse 1: Phora]
Yeah
It's been a while since I spoke to you, everything seems different now
I'm tryna focus, you've been out of frame, but it's crazy how I see the picture now
It's been a while since you've been around, me, I finally put the liquor down
Crazy how life is bittersweet, 'cause my grandpa is gettin' sicker now
Yeah, I've been tryin' not to lose touch, but all this stress is just too much
When I was young, it was me and him ridin' 'round the city just the two of us
Wish I spent more time with him, all the times that I held back
All this money in my bank account, but there ain't a way to buy health back
See, back then we was close, then I lost who I was
Gettin' close to my dreams, but further from who I love
What's meant to be is just meant to be, I don't think we could change that
I ain't sayin' I regret it now, I just wish I had them days back
And that's real

Does it hurt to think of me? (think of me)
Wishin' your heart still belonged to me, yeah

I'll be here if you come look for me (look for me)

[Verse 2: Phora]
Yeah
It's been a while since I spoke to you, both of us gettin' older now
Life is movin' so fast for me, I just wish I had a way to slow it down
Wish I wasn't scared to open up, 'cause I ain't talked to my dad still
But he's stubborn though, that's where I get it from, he drinks Hennessy with his Advil
Everyone say I'm just like him; we smile hard and we hide tears
Even though I've seen him last month, I ain't seen my dad in like five years
And that gets to me, heart's heavy, I just can't adjust to these changes
Lost some people that was closest to me, now I'm losin' all of my patience
Ex girls say they still love me, old friends just come and go
Really I've been tryna move on, but I'm too afraid to end up alone
Too afraid to give my love, 'cause I'm too afraid I won't feel love
And I'm too afraid that I'll find love just to find out it's not real love
I got so many trust issues, wish I was there to uplift you
And even though we ain't close now, it's difficult to not miss you
But I wonder what you say to people when they speak about me
I know we both went our separate ways, I just wonder if you still think about me
That's real

It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

[Verse 2]
And what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace

And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', ""oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?""

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

Don't you go away

You turn around, looked my way
I can't say that it hasn't crossed my mind
I'd loved you all along

And now we're leaving yesterday behind
We'll never be alone, oh

Friends in love
Hoping that we always will be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling now we've got forever and a day

293,When He Shines,"This man's a child, this man is old
Sometimes he's mild, sometimes he's bold
This man I love sometimes in spite
Of wishing he'd stick to his guns
Or abandon the fight

But when he shines, oh when he shines
When he shines, he shines so bright

Sometimes a tramp, sometimes a dude
He changes color just like a chameleon
Can sense the mood
This man's a tune, it's not easy to write
This man's a moon in the morning and the sun out at night

But when he shines, oh when he shines
When he shines, he shines so bright

This is a gentle man, this man is strong
This temperamental man plays me along

But when he shines, yes when he shines
When he shines, he shines so bright

Darting from shadows into the light
This emotional man in perpetual flight
Shine, shine, this shining man",Mary Hopkin,1982,"[97, 92, 88, 75, 30, 30, 32, 33, 35, 39, 46, 52, 59, 64, 75]",15

Hustle all day and dream of the islands and sea
Millions of girls but none of them seemed right for me
'Till you came along and you touched me and set me free

So we slipped away last night eased on down to the Keys
Flying so high we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze
Living on love and the fruits from tropical trees
With a song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

A bottle rum listen to the steel drum band
Laughing in the moonlight along the beach we ran
Splashing naked in the sea making love upon the sand
Falling fast asleep like children hand in hand

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

I woke up this morning with the sunlight in my eyes
Guess it was only a dream I hear the city outside
But I look at you sleeping and honey now I realize
That anywhere with you is paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes

Ironically I got a company, that's with my bros
And there's tonnes of women, that's relationship goals
I'm still soul-searching, that's why I don't trust a soul, I'm a lone wolf

Cash rules everything around me, they don't get no cream
I just handled mamas rent, so no rental please
But I might just go and put my Barbie in some Kenzo jeans
This life never chose me, it's the life I chose
We just made a killing, could've died I know
My calling was so instrumental, xylophone
Could've left with keys, but we left on a higher note
Yeah, I've been a sinner
But I gave my all, I pray my lord is a forgiver

I just hit the lick, and now a niggas drowning in some liquor

The fire of a mare and
The strength of a stud

It's breeding
And it's training
And it's something unknown
That drives you and carries you home

Adam planted a single apple to sing this album
Do you think you have what it takes to shape the masses?
Do you have the strength to crack and break your ribs and make it happen?
Adam did it after all
Created Eve then added on
And now they kids are fishing for a frikkin' fission atom bomb
'at a boy that's the only answer after Martial Law
We been in rations for too long we'd rather face the wrath of God
Authorities have dropped the ball
Securing banks and not the law
The older generation praying so amen and inshallah
I've seen the vision through my prophet eye
And my oh my
I just hope you'll be alive to fly
Been living in outer limits without a limit around my mind
I copped a cloud with Stevie Wonder ribbon in the sky
Whoever said that Evolution was just a theory was clearly living in fear
My niggas started from an atom now we here

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed - no angel dust, label us Notorious
Thug ass niggas that love to bust; it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
You should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you

[Verse 3:]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
Hopes and dreams that got chopped in two
Categories I'm boxed into
Labels that limit the artist
Stealing the art, its larcen, opted into
I'm trying to be all opulent too
Weaving toxic air follicles
We kill money, oil, fossil fuels
My niggas win like they really ain't got to lose
Probably cause there really ain't a lot to lose
I'm from the land of base heads and prostitutes
I'm trying keep an old soul like Posdnuos
But folks sell their own soul like pass the noose!
All to be popping
Niggas can't read the fine print, I guess we de-evolve

[Verse 4]
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, Bible in my left
Pages flippin like an acrobat
Yall would say the pledge
I raise the fist above, the afro back
Type of niggas didn't have the guts to climb the Aggro Cragg
Aggravated agents, raided aggregators back to back
Tryna gage an elavated educated black to back
I was up constructing social studies, studies after math
Trash the status quo like it's Aftermath, Shaft the math
After hours after class, Apple Jacks and tackle task
'Fore I learn to fly, used to jump and try to tap the glass
Had to strap the jimmy for the game before I tapped that ass
Victor, called the game before she came and got attached to fast
Rappers think they changing shit by saying shit
Where the fucks yo action?
Look what happened to Lesane Parish, Hendrix, Marley, Michael Jackson
Caskets shattered, drugged up for killin' lies and spillin' truth
Just imagine what these mothafuckas tryna do to you

When you're on the top
There's no place you can really go but down, down, down
People on the street congratulate you
They say they love the way you sound

Where...when you're on the low
No one wants to chit or chat or even know your name
Your agent's never there
Your manager has ripped you off and gone somewhere
Standing on the top

Standing on the top...top
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top (Yeah)...top
On the top getting down, Temptations sing

[Verse 2]
When you're on the top
Everyone you meet they wanna be your long lost friend
They say how great you are, a superstar
But do you have any money to lend
(Hey, man, can you loan me a few bucks?)

When you're on the low
Where do all the freaks and fancy people go?
(I don't know) I don't know
People sit and stare
Asking crazy questions: ""Do you braid your hair?"" and ""What's L-7 Square?""

308,The Last Safe Place On Earth,"Someone medicate me sound, an introduction to all that eludes definition
Bring me something definite to chew cud with
I remember this one night, the world was still dead back then
The way it spun to my shins to dance with blankets being chased
In circles. 3000 miles from new home, forty-five miles from old home
Thinking about new life, old friends
Huddling rocks, big world, small life
Everything spins that has a point, and me spinning hysterical
Crying...them laughing...stems in my hair, dancing in the grass
Atop a mountain, the perfect landing for a UFO
The lights blink...oncoming traffic...hysteria
Is my history and my friends don't see what I see:
Solemn faces in the bushes absorbing the story. like
I'm not the first delusional coming to grips losing my friends
And it's killing me graceful. so I apologize to god
For Brendan, Adam and Brandon, and ask god what happens when I die
No answer. sadness strikes me dead in my bellowing state
Remembering some girl I'd never love. so far detached
From the world I can't know and the faces I can't see

One-hundred yards to the left, a burned down house
Where the father killed the wife and kids
And I'm lookin' for him, and he's hiding from me
'cause he doesn't exist in this world;
He's in heaven, he's forgiven. the rest: in limbo like me
Aging, thinking ""pill."" crying into a pillow called sky
Who keeps me warm when it's freezing in the summer time
And laughing girls are golden, sitting in the fire
Talking about school and how funny I was
Drunk outside clubs, practicing forgetting
And dubbing people over who wouldn't fit on my tape

Well, my thief friend brought a guitar for the trip
And didn't know how to play, but I felt it in my stomach
And sang gibberish and wrote gibberish and was gibberish
Still, less gibberish than being alive July 2nd, 1999

In the gibberish party, Don put out the bonfire...
Something about wardens...something about not camping...
Something about driving down an unlit rock trail on some mountain in some
Nameless Sebago city, and dying some documentary death
Didn't thrill me. I'm staying here, it's the last safe place on earth

And when I first saw the flames at the bottom, and my drunk minor friends
Melting into the rocks, and ticks feasting on my piggy flesh...
These two will try to kill me, these three are dead....
I should be home asleep, not being blamed for someone's stupidity

It's not the road, the space around me ripped
And I was chased by white birds that don't sing
That are always there but I can't touch

I will not die; some passed out life, overdose
Praying to not be eaten by my own mortality
When dogs bark in the country or junkies overdose in amusement parks
I pass through the sunken uncity and bang a payphone
'cause I lost my cellphone and can't remember anyone's number
Not even my own

Oh, you wanna be in my movie? don't move, don't talk
Don't just stand there like all epiphanies are purchased in the old port
From someone who smokes kind nugs
I am not zen; I'm calm like a city killer with poison oak
Waiting patiently by the lake to be saved
By cut-out friends who cut out. save yourself

I am not zen; I'm calm like a city killer with poison oak
Waiting patiently by the lake to be saved
By cut-out friends who cut out. save yourself

318,Still In Saigon,"[Verse 1]
Got on a plane in 'Frisco
And got off in Vietnam
I walked into a different world
The past forever gone
I could have gone to Canada
Or I could have stayed in school
But I was brought up differently
I couldn't break the rules
Thirteen months and fifteen days
The last ones were the worst
One minute I'd kneel down and pray
And the next I'd stand and curse
No place to run to
Where I did not feel that war
When I got home I stayed alone
And checked behind each door

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind

[Verse 2]
The ground at home was covered in snow
And I was covered in sweat
My younger brother calls me a killer
And my daddy calls me a vet
Everybody says I'm someone else
And I'm sick and there's no cure
Damned if I know who I am
There was only one place I was sure

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Every summer when it rains
I smell the jungle, I hear the planes
I can't tell no one, I feel ashamed
Afraid some day I'll go insane
That's been ten long years ago
And time has gone on by
Now and then I catch myself
Eyes searching through the sky
All the sounds of long ago
Will be forever in my head
Mingled with the wounded cries
And the silence of the dead

322,Old Fashioned Love,"Most folks nowadays
Say old fashioned ways
Should give place to things that are new
But somehow I hold
Things that are old
Perhaps it's an old fashioned view
I love my old books
Old corners and nooks
My old home and old friends
Old memories too
One love that is true
Lasting all the life, until it ends

I've got that old fashioned love in my heart, oh baby
Yes, and there it will always remain
My love is like an ivy vine, clinging a little closer all the time
Through the years, joy and tears, just the same

I've got that old fashioned faith in my heart
Oh, changes can't tear it apart
If the dry land change to sea
That will never make any change in me
'Cause I've got that old, old fashioned love in my heart

I've got that old fashioned faith in my heart
And nothing can tear us apart
If the dry land may change to sea
There will never make any change in me

I couldn't even find not one clean shirt
There was no hot water when I jumped in the shower
I know my boss is gonna dock me an hour
The older I get the more I discover
If it ain't one thing it's another
I got to the car, tried to get motivated
Now I'm stuck in the traffic, all I'm doing is waiting
The fool behind me keeps blowin' his horn
I got my top laid back and it's coming up a storm
The older I get the more I discover
If it ain't one thing it's another
Light bill, phone bill, water and gas
Pay day comes and it goes so fast
There's no way out and I'm telling you brother
If it ain't one thing it's another
I got to the job and I tried to explain
The boss said, ""You won't have to do that again""
I called home just to tell her the news
She said, ""Bye, bye, baby, I'm leaving you""
She took the kids and she's gone to her mother's
If it ain't one thing, it's another

Let me explain it, how I let the three wheel swanging
Drop it side to side, lock it up and then bang it
That's right, westcoast, L.A. originated
Prepared to take flight, now I'm the pilot desingated
Maylay cocked fist sitting, switch hitting
Hundred spoke twisting, five twenty stip gripping
See the bottom of the transmission, sixtey six inching
Showin' off how to quote it in Chrome suspension
Get my crown home, my bounce on
Cut the sounds on and stomping like Bow Wow
They already known I got the hottest rider going
Flatbed in the back, just in case I gotta tore them
Cause I sure give it up, let me catch them with that wheels stuck
Jumping out soundin' like Dub, yeah nigga what
Two licks on the switch, and they got up
With the ass in locked up, that mothafucker hot hop

[Hook: WC]
Nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
Pull the trigger, give it up, lift the Chevy grill up
Nigga what, if you a crip or a blood
Nigga I don't give a fuck, let me see them fingers up
Nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
Pull the trigger, give it up, lift the Chevy grill up
Nigga what, got me throwin' up my Dubs
Through that nigga cutting it up, Toones is fucking it up

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Who is it, the black nigga with the big dick
Toss it up with Crazy Toones taking your trick
But that bitch better swallow
I don't give a damn if she has fake ass rap model
Nigga get the fuck out here, ""while below me down""
If she sucked my balls, if she want me to stink
I don't give a fuck I'm filled with curse words
Fuck all your radio geeks and nerds
And fuck the....my black ass still gon eat
Airplay they can't stop the Villain
Slanging mixtapes like my fucking ass dope dealing
Take a flight with Dub and X

Knick knackin' police rollin' in the Patty wagon
Push it through the alley askin' where Dub and Toones at..and

Is it really true them niggas grew up on that house
Niggas sit and chat, talk behind the loc's back
But when we come through, like what's happenin' they don't want no action
Little faggots, ya'll don't want it, cause we're pistol packin'
And you know the Childhood brothers won't get to gatin'

337,Stars on 45 III,"CABELLO KICKED OFF HER SOLO CAREER AND HER BAND SISTERS IN FIFTH HARMONY UNEXPECTEDLY DENOUNCED HER FOR IT. NOW SHE’S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE, A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: “YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE”.

CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city’s center.

As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.

Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.

Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).

But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.

She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.

“It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”

But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.

“You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”

The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.)

Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.

The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.

Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.

Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.

Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.

Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.

But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance).

She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants, and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.”

After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.”

“The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.

“I mean, [we were] at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But, she says, “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!”

The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career, despite the grueling schedule.

Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life, so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant, she would be in the studio’s gym, writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and, in time, arenas.

“I would wake up super early,” says Cabello, “get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.”

So she was basically singing into the toilet?

“Yep.”

“She has done her 10,000 hours,” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.”

But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.

When I ask her about it, Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:

*When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*

I don’t know. I was always super open [that] I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.

*Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*

I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it’s because of this thing or [another] thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.

*Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*

No.

*Have you reached out directly?*
I did, yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.

*When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like, “What’s happening?”*

I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.

Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún.

“The first four days were trippy,” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!”

Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.

Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.

“My parents worked really hard,” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.”

(Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)

Cabello’s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.

She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like, ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,’ ” which she is. “I went [to clubs], and I was like, ‘I don’t love this.’ ”

After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.”

Mainly, Cabello’s focused on making music.

Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.

She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016.

Romantically speaking, says Cabello, “I don’t have anything going on right now,” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.)

And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:

“I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.”

A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples.

“I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel, who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.

“It’s a real collaboration,” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.”

The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever,” she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One,” all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.

They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.”

“Camila is an incredible songwriter,” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.”

Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante.

Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time, and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.

Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line, “I ain’t worried about nothing,” and punctuated it with a full stop.

“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist, that’s success.”

In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello.

“I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that,” she tells me this time around.

Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.

“It’s so hard to hear that,” says Cabello, lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective, like, ‘Damn, poor girl.’ ”

She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this [conflict] doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this.

“I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me, if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart, that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean, isn’t that the goal?”

If Cabello is anxious now, it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together,” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t:

“We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”",Billboard,1982,"[96, 62, 28, 28, 29, 32, 38, 45, 71, 85]",10

La ce-pu est Lyca, le bigo est PGP
Ses fils de te-pu veulent me contrôler
JRM, Y'a quoi dans ton sac-à-dos
La selra, des dorés, des mikados
Si j'montre ma tête gros c'est pas pour rien
Si on vient a 3 ça s'ra pas pour rire
Le tel, calibre et moi
Rien ne sert de courir (cavale)
On brasse brasse jusqu'à que ça paie
Gros, c'est ça le thème
Bitch, c'est ça que t'aime
Demande a Papo, à 14 piges
Une cagoule, paire de gant et un pied de biche
C'est ça que l'on faisait
Mais la dalle a pas changé
Ça coupe des 100G, sans gêne
Ramène ton string ficelle
Une fellation vas-y fait la bien ( vas-y fait la bien, vas-y fait la bien)
Vas-y fais la bien, vas-y fait la bien

[Couplet 2 : MNKS]
Je fais d'l'argent et j'en veux encore
Profite de la vie en revendant la mort
Il claque tout son biff chez Louboutin et Dior
Mais le frigo de la miff est vide mon ami orh
Elle ses cuisses sont ouvertes toute l'année
Plus de passes que le shit à Nador
Elle a sucé des bites, elle en sucera encore
Et son daron croit encore qu'elle aura sa dote
Augmente la basse, fait péter la tchop
Si y'a des tass' sur la banquette faut que ça djosse
Et si elles chipotent ces salopes faut qu'elles sautent
Bande d'arrêt d'urgence de la A1, allez hop
Eh mon gars ça t'dirait de stopper la clope
Viens plutôt prendre l'illicite dans le coffre
Et si jamais ça te plait tu prends ton abonnement
Si ça te plait pas t'en reprend quand même sale con

Trou de boulette sur l'joggo tech pack
T'inquiètes pas ça re-ti j'm'arrêtes pas
Tu t'souviens qu'ça vendait des rette-ba
Faisait ti-par la coco dans l'vespa
Finis l'époque où ils sont tous pété sous Despe'
J'attire les tasspé j'pète les plombs comme Despo (Rutti)
Ça sent la queue d'vant la boutique gros téma les (Gucci)
Avant de traverser analyse les
Dommage pour le featuring j'suis pas dispo
Va dire à Macron qu'j'vais légaliser
Le chocolat en forme de Balisto
T'attends d'vant la boîte vu qu't'es pas listé
Porte d'Italie j'y vais pour visser
De Boboch' accélère jusqu'à gyCer
En espérant qu'y ait pas d'ralentisseur
Surveille ta sœur
Si j'rentre dans le cercle
C'est pas dans celui de Fianso tu vois l'histoire
Mais d'où il sort ?
Est-ce qu'il est sah ?
Bah ouais qu'jsuis sah
Téma mes cernes
Si ton équipe pense à débouler
Assure toi qu'elle viendra cagouler
En espérant qu'y ai pas de louper
Sinon t'inquiètes on reviendra dans la foulée

[Couplet 4 : Digba]
C'est la loi du plus fort
Avec ou sans arme mon vieux
Y'a des têtes que personne touche
A cause des représailles mon Dieu
Chaque jour je me lève d'mon pieu
J'essaye de m'faire 100 balles dans la poche
Au son la pétasse s'accroche
Parce qu'elle veut monter dans la Porsche (CRU!)
400 balles de détaille sur une table en verre (CRU!)
L'état tous les jours on lui met à l'envers (Sheesh)
Il s'enfile un pe-pom, part au quart de tour
Pour faire des sous on a pas besoin de grandes tours (CRU!)
Que des mauvaises graines qu'y essaye de pas pousser à Fleury
Des comme moi y'en a des centaines
En ensemble Nike vendant des xeu-di
On a fait le tour d'la lle-vi
On s'est promis d'pas vendre de semis
Que d'la frappe, du crack, de la CC
Vendre de la neige pour s'envoler l'été

And nobody knows him, and nobody cares
'Cause there's no hidin' place
There's no hidin' place

Lookin' everywhere at no one
He sees everything and nothing at all, oh
When he shouts, nobody listens
Where he leads, no one will go, oh

He's a lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for something to show

And nobody knows him, and nobody cares
'Cause there's no hidin' place

Are we just like all the rest?
We're lookin' too hard for somethin' he's got
Or movin' too fast to rest
But like a monkey on your back, you need it
But do you love it enough to leave it all?

What he's waiting for, I don't know

Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills and loans

343,Fly Away,"[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ahem
I'd like for you to take this time
And remember where you was
The first time you heard Dedication
If I asked you how many times you've listened to D2
Could you tell me?
Dedication 3 was the first mixtape you heard
When we had a black president
D4 and 5, we got back to business
Y'all done copied the rhymes
Y'all done stole the artwork
Tried to emulate my shit-talkin'
Weezy and Dram' — we are the Mixtape Blueprint
Hahaha! You welcome
A Dedication

[Verse 1: Wayne]
I got Doja, Narcotics, and Actavis; that's DNA
Got a Dyke-ho, Nympho, And your bitch layin' next to me and bae
Eazy like NWA, they make me feel A-OK
Feeling like Tony, ""Grrreat!""; feeling all on me, TSA
She got Dollars, Nut, and Alcohol all over her T&A
She snort all this KKK, and this broad need AAA
Let's enjoy some NBA, y'all lil boys NCAA
Yeah we got A-M-M-O, but you'll get beat like MMA
I got Dracos, Ninos, Automatics; that's my DNA
You'll get beat like Sugar Ray, TKO, O-H-H
I smoke O's, I sip Ace, I pop whole Xanies straight
I got P's, I got weight, I got kis, I got gates
I got moonrock, molly, ecstasy, inside this weed, it's laced
I smoke doobies, don't smoke J's
Don't watch movies, don't go to plays
I watch cuties, porn, and play
I got Uzis on the way
I don't be choosey, I don't be safe
I don't get woozy, I get the waist
My bitch ballin' like Sinead, Erykah Badu with the fade
Capital-WNBA, I just teach her how to save
I been sleepin' with my AK, with my finger around her waist
I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate
She's gon' take it to the face, like ""Thin line between love and hate""
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
All these diamonds, all this gold and shit, call that PB&J
I got Bloods in LA, I got Bloods down in the A
I got Bloods everywhere you lay but ain't no blood in my filet
Hit the court, shoot the DA, treat beef like USDA
OMW to your trap, (Blap!) — Now I'll be On My Way
I got plugs I ain't got to pay, I got shit I ain't got to say
I got cribs way out of state, I ain't got no more pocket space
Sippin' slo-mo at my pace, lean like I wear a brace
Queens want to be embraced, Kings want to be an Ace
I remember Ace of Spades, I remember the Goose is Grey
Now it's Bumbu by the case, nigga, fuck you, fly away

I already got the Ganja
I already got the Fanta
All black like Uganda
Hair back like E. Honda, wait
Hardhat like a condom
Your skull crack, then we crowned you
Shark bite to a flounder
Bar fight to a bouncer, wait
All Franks like Sinatra
Face been painted, they ain't never clowned him
Everybody rakin' cash like it's autumn
Y'all boys sweeter than Whatchamacallit
All y'all take a seat on this toilet
Y'all ain't shit, but y'all piss-poor, and
Sittin' in the foreign like I'm on a Harley
Keep bloodsuckers away with the garlic
Alone in a mansion, I'm Macaulay Culkin
Thought about your coffin and started barfin'
Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful
Walkin' on the marble, feelin' like Ricardo
Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target
Sittin' on the charter, talkin' 'bout the targets
Waitin' on departure, waitin' on a sculpture
Make sure my vultures keep an extra cartridge
And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie
My dick is her electric chair, feel the voltage
And her pussy better smell like a orchid
Wetter than a wishin' well, need a quarter
Damn, I wish I was a lil bit taller
Damn, I wish I drank a lil more water
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder
Damn, I pull up with a redbone, scarlet
With a yellowbone car
That smoke green, that's Marley
Purple and the orange, you seen, that's horror
No Eve in my garden, F-R-uh, F-R-uh
All the Gs in my corner, them boys so warriors
Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Kis and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins
I continue goin', I get to the boar and
I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'
Then I just yawn and forget to mourn and
Give to the star, it's 6, the reward",Lil Wayne,1982,"[84, 88]",2
344,I'm In Love Again,"Here I go again, drifting on my own feet
Lately it seems I've been, being old foolish me
Mumble when I try to talk
Stumble when I try to walk
It's like I'm in a state of shock when I'm with you

Here I go again, looking just like a clown
Everything I say is wrong whenever you're around
Somehow I got kind a shy
I can't look you in the eye
I come all apart inside when I'm with you

Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, think I'm in love again
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, think I'm in love

I won't lie to you, I've been in love before
And I think that you're the one that I've been waiting for
I've been around I'll admit
But this time all the pieces fit
Something tells me this is it, when I'm with you

Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, I think I'm in love again
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, I think I'm in love

If you'll only say you'll stay with me forever more
'Cause I know I'll never fall in love again
If you'll only say you'll stay with me forever more
'Cause I know I'll never fall in love again

Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, I think I'm in love again
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, I think I'm in love

If you'll only say you'll stay with me forever more

Either step up or step back

Now you know I don't write no bad checks
I have no wish to repent
I've seen a few but whatever I do
I don't cause no accidents
Whiskey and wine help me pass the time
I don't leave no evidence

Baby step back, baby step back
Either step up or step back
Baby step back, baby step back
Either step up or step back

Still I don't kneel down I was born to fight
So you best leave me alone
Maybe I'll get much more than I need
Or much less than I should own
Last of all let me say it again
Either step up or step on

Ay
Look, I don't know what done got into me
I been fuckin’ wit new niggas, new bitches
Now I just feel like they plottin' on me
And I play I don't know but really I know
Most these niggas ain’t rockin' wit me
Bitch Im still gettin' old money
Spent all my show money
That shit was nothing to me
You don't know what the fuck I went through
Just to get where Im at so you wouldn't understand it
Do this shit for my momma, my cousins
My uncle, my aunties and both of my granny's
Ion trip over shit bitch I take what I want
So there really ain't shit you can hand me
Ain't no summer round here bitch Im hot than a bitch
So that’s why I got bitches to fan me

Back seat of a Chevy Im nervous as hell
Been a minute since I hit a lick, plus Im hot than a bitch
Clutchin’ that 30 ignoring that I gotta piss
“Aye, pull up at the store I ain't feelin’ to good
I think I gotta go take a shit”
(2z you ain't backin' out better chill the fuck out
Lemme find out you ain't built for this)

I ain’t never been a bitch, hit the damn gas
And let's get all this shit over with
And plus I need the money, my momma been crying
She ain't got enough for the rent
And that's the same woman that tell me
Don't worry bout shit but I know she just actin'
I got partners who's mommas got shot
Just because of some old shit that already happened
I just couldn't imagine
I'd shoot the whole city without even askin'
This money wouldn't mean shit
If I didn't go through what I went through
To make this shit happen
In too deep in this shit, it's too hard just to quit
Sometimes I forget that I be rappin'
Post a pic of a gun and I ‘posed to believe you
Just cuz what you said in yo caption?

“Aye 2z you see what those boys said about you?”
Hell nah what he say?
“He say you soft and you don't know bout
That struggle shit”
Awww thats what he say?
“Yup”
Tell that nigga I said this


Look
Tell ‘em get off of my dick
Mf's don't know me they act like they do
And that shit is just making me sick
Yeah I love my niggas but wit or witout ‘em
Lil 2z ain't runnin' from shit
I remember them nights when we couldn't pay
The lights and we went to sleep sweating and shit
If I told you I love you I meant it my nigga
But that do not mean you a part of me
Thinking two moves ahead
Cause these shady ass niggas out here think
That they be out smarting me
If I see sum I like and I want it
My nigga it's fuck it just know it's a robbery
Anything for the bitches the cars and the clothes
And even yo property

You see what Im sayin?
Like this shit real like this shit come from my mf court
You know what Im sayin so like
A lot of niggas had that peaches and cream ass childhood
You know what Im sayin
I was sellin' crack at 15 tryna get those new 11s that came out
Hol' up, Hol' Up
I say

If I see sum I like and I want it
My nigga it's fuck it just know it's a robbery
Anything for the bitches the cars and the clothes
And even yo property
You niggas don't really be sippin' on Drank
Yo shit lookin' watery
They say 2z describe your childhood in one word
Im sayin its poverty
And momma she went with that ? In her fetus
And that shit right there really bothered me
And Im only 18 but all of the older niggas
Always tell me that they honor me
And I love the fact that I came up from the bottom
Cause now it's a stronger me
I just pray that one day I wake up
And it's an end to this shit

Said to my friend, baby (everything stops)
Nothin' else mattered

Than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken hearted
Somethin' within him
But the moment
That I first laid
Eyes on him

Maybe I will go again
Tomorrow, yeah, yeah

There was no one left standing
In the hall, yeah, yeah
In a flood of tears

Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer
Just to hear the call

When we're walkin', rolling and rocking
It is one time I'm glad I'm not a man
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

I'm in Heaven

Raise expectations to a new intention
No one can sing
Quite like Smokey, Smokey Robinson
Wailin' and skankin' to Bob Marley
Reggae's expanding with Sly and Robbie

Oops! Your mama said uh
Oops! Your mama said uh
Oops! Your mama

All the weekend
Boyfriend was missing
I surely miss him
The way he'd hold me in his warm arms
We went insane when we took cocaine

Stepping in a rhythm to a Kurtis Blow
Who needs to think when your feet just go
With a hippie-the-hip and a hippie-the-hop
Who needs to think when your feet just go
""Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon, Bohannon""
Who needs to think when your feet just go

For what drove her away
From somewhere over in the corner

The majority of people are not successful because they prepare to quit.They have a mental program that it's okay to prepare more for quiting then preparing to succeed, ama make my dreams to reality

Mama Mamaaaa

My mama used to say to me x2

Dollar bill Dollar bill
Dollar bill Dollar bill yo x2

My mama used to say to me
(Just go and hustle) (x2) x4

Cash rules everything around me CREAM
Dollar dollar bill yo yo
My niga used to say the industry might doubt me please
Guess we'll see about that
They used to tell me ""you won't be shit without me"" sheesh
We gotta chill about that
My mama used to say never sleep on your dreams
And oops I nearly pissed my bed

[Verse 1]

There's 2 kinds of people
The too kind and evil
I'm too kind even if nigas take your kindness for weakness
But my mama used to say never let your feelings change how you living

But I know y'all envy
The jealousy plenty
Took away the seat but y'all still can't stand me
My mama used to say be the last man standing always
Never give up no way
A few of them are gon hate
But respect they gon pay
Got a problem solve it
Be good to these people fuck being a savage
Be careful what you do bad news travel
A few snakes in the grass better watch your circle
And most of all never announce your finance
Always fight to keep a balance
And live your life but don't forget you're a parent
I wanna thank you for that lesson

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

The pain that came with the Karma
The shit I could avoided if I listened to my mama
When she said boy make sure you do lover her
Even if you leave make sure you do hug her
And say to her baby just know that I got you
We might be apart but there's no one besides you
And I won't lie there's something that's inside you
Something so special more precious than a diamond

You made a tyma, You made a tyma
Now my mama is a grandma
It's all on me to make sure I do better
And I put it on myself to make sure that I never
Let my little man even go through what I went through
Grow up without a father
Hell nah
So Ima listen to my mama when she say.. To my mama when she say

Don't forget there could be
An old lover in her memory

Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay

You bastards think it's funny
Lying and thieving all your life
Think all there is, is money
Got your future wrapped up tight

But just 'cos you got the power
That don't mean you got the right

You can take my fingers, buddy
You can take my eyes
You can take my past and future
It won't make you wise
You can have me thrown in jail
You can steal my booze
You can even steal my mail
Step on my blue suede shoes

You bastards might be clever
Got it mapped out in black and white
But you remember you can never
Teach a dog to stand upright

And just 'cos you got the power
That don't mean you got the right
And just 'cos you got the power
That don't mean you got the right

Go on out, make another deal
Feed your big fat face
Go on out, and cop a feel
Get on somebody's case
You surely could be satisfied
If you could get it all
But time ain't on your side
You're going to the wall

You think that life's just dollars
Won with greed and lust and spite
But I wasn't born to follow
Like to get my sleep at night
I surely do, honey

373,Juke Box Hero,"[Verse 1]
Standing in the rain, with his head hung low
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day
Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure
That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was one way ticket, only one way to go

[Chorus]
So he started rocking
He is never going to stop
Got to keep on rocking
Someday he's going to make it to the top

And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero
He took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes
Juke box hero, he'll come alive tonight

[Verse 2]
In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain
And that one guitar made his whole life change

[Chorus]
Now he needs to keep on rockin'
He just can't stop
Gotta keep on rocking'
Someday gonna make it to the top

Seem awful empty without her

I never thought that I'd be facing
A sea that's bluer than the tide

And I can't look in your eyes

But if you're gonna make me do it
How'd you want it done?
Is it best to sip it slowly
Or drink it down in one?

380,On A Carousel,"Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?

Horses chasing cause they're racing
So they ain't so far

On a carousel, on a carousel

Nearer and nearer by changing horses, still so far away
People fighting for their places just get in my way
Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you
Still we're going round

On a carousel, on a carousel
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too

As she leaves, she drops the presents that she won before
Pulling ducks out of the water, got the highest score
Now's my chance and I must take it, a case of do-or-die

On a carousel, on a carousel
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too

Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?

Now we take our ride together
No more chasing her

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now

Come on!

[Verse 1]
Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by
I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold

[Verse 2]
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

My memory has just been sold

This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take you car, Yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yea, I guess I gotta buy it!

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold

Uh, now, they lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
Got it, capisce? Hungry as hell trying to eat now
Success is the only thing that can complete us
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this (Logic)
Now I've accepted I'm not from the hood
Cause sellin' crack and bustin' gats don't make my raps good
See this is me, L.O.G.I.C. reppin' MD to the fullest

I can't wait 'til I see my name in neon
That fly shit I be on flowin' for eons
Every day I take chances, Celine Dion
Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion, let's get it
I'm a diamond in the rough, but I shine like disco
Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though
Bumping up in they city like, ""oh my God, this go""
My business getting better every year like fiscal
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm a original see but they trace like stencil
A stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
'Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time
'Cause when I flow the crowd never roll 'cause I rock
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit

392,On The Way To The Sky,"We are two
And two of us are one
I'm back on my feet again
Out on the street again
Looking for love
On the way to the sky

Some people moving up
And some people standing still
Some hold their hands out
And some people never will

Lovers and liars
Consumed by the fires
Of too many dances
But not enough song, you're my song

We pity the poor one
The shy and unsure one
Who wanted it perfect
But waited too long
There's no way to count
Or to measure the cost
Of the innocence lost
On the way to the sky
You and I

And we are two
And two of us are one
But maybe two of us
Can be enough to get it done

Lovers and liars
Consumed by the fires
Of too many dances
But not enough song

We pity the poor one
The shy the unsure one
Who wanted it perfect
But waited too long
Much too long

I'm back on my feet again
I'm out on the street again
Looking for love
On the way to the sky

396,Leader Of The Band,"An only child alone and wild
A cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none --
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know
I never can repay
A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once
But his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls
Took me years to understand
The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy
To the leader of the band
My brothers' lives were different
For they heard another call
One went to Chicago
And the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose
And come to know so well
(Instrumental)
I thank you for the music
And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go --
I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough
And, papa, I don't think I
Said 'I love you' near enough --
The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy

Another sleepless night alone in bed
Another silent dawn
You try to think of things you might have said
You try to carry on

I wash my face
Then drink beer
Then I weep
Say a prayer and induce
Insincere self-abuse

Maybe I was dreaming
Maybe disrespectful of fair play
Oh rise, rise, or stay bound
My eyes are grey
And the world is round

I know this girl. I call her my wife. She is my wife. She is my thorn in the bushes. No happy endings and no fuss. What a girl, what a saint, what a wife ain't is my wife. So I sleep in a bed too big for one person. I'm big for one person. But this bed is bigger than both of us..

[Verse 1]
They tell me, ""Don't forget where you came from""
I regret what I came from
In my old hood moving like I got a vest on me
I'ma keep on winning, you should place your bets on me
I could open up a bakery, baguettes on me
Walking through the mall, I got a check on me
Designer look the best on me
I got lots of pressure, lotsa stress on me
Independent, I got people that depend on me
Knew you was a fake, you can't pretend on me
What I used to spend on you, I spend on me
Somehow all these problems keep on landing on me
I went on a mission with a bad bitch

All this money turned me to a savage
My life was better when I didn't have shit

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home
Driving by myself, ain't got nowhere to go

Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know

[Verse 2]
Me and Metro Boomin' want some more, yah
All this money made me bored, yah
But there's lots of drugs to explore, yah
I'm a boss, yeah, I could employ ya
Couldn't buy one, now I got four, yah
Used to pray feds don't kick down the door, yah
Running back the sack the trap feel like a sport, yah
Yeah I'm famous but I miss my life before, yah
Finally got some money, can't go to the store
I lose every girl I love when I'm on tour
My mama calling me and I ignore
Running from my problems 'til my feet get sore

Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home

414,You Could Have Been With Me,"You're the seventh son of the seventh son
Maybe that's why you're such a strange and special one
You can't even seem to love yourself
And with a few exceptions, not anybody else

You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink
You can give a man your whole heart and soul, but you cannot make him think

Chorus:
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely

You can tell him the day of departure, exactly the place and the time
He might really wanna be there, but he misses every time
Is he a man or a paper tiger
When you need him will he run or stand beside you

415,I Believe,"[ELDER PRICE]
Ever since I was a child, I tried to be the best...
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed...
So what happened?

It was supposed to be all so exciting, to be teaching of Christ 'cross the sea
But I allowed my faith to be shaken – oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed to help the needy, to do the things I never dared
This was the time for me to step up, so then why was I so scared?

A warlord who shoots people in the face – what's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier and always has my back
Now I must be completely devout; I can't have even one shred of doubt!

I believe that the Lord God created the universe
I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins
And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America
I am a Mormon!
And a Mormon just believes

You cannot just believe part-way, you have to believe in it all
My problem was doubting the Lord's will, instead of standing tall
I can't allow myself to have any doubt, it's time to set my worries free
Time to show the world what Elder Price is about, and share the power inside of me!

I believe that God has a plan for all of us
I believe that plan involves me getting my own planet
And I believe that the current President of the Church, Thomas Monson, speaks directly to God
I am a Mormon!
And, dang it, a Mormon just believes! (A Mormon just believes!)

I know that I must go and do the things my God commands (Things my God commands!)
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith, he will always answer you
Just believe in him and have no fear

[UGANDAN SOLDIER]
(General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!)

[ELDER PRICE]
I believe that Satan has a hold of you
I believe that the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people! (Black people!)
You can be a Mormon!
A Mormon who just believes...

[GENERAL BUTT-FUCKING NAKED]
(The fuck is this?)

[ELDER PRICE]
And now I can feel the excitement: this is the moment I was born to do
And I feel so incredible to be sharing my faith with you
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith, if you ask God himself, you'll know
But you must ask him without any doubt, and let your spirit grow! (Let your spirit grow!)

I believe that God lives on a planet called Kolob!
I believe that Jesus has his own planet as well
And I believe that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri


If you believe, the Lord will reveal it
And you'll know it's all true – you'll just feel it
You'll be a Mormon!
And, by gosh, a Mormon just believes
(A Mormon just believes)

(Just believe, a Mormon just believes)
Oh, I believe! (Just believe, a Mormon just...)
I believe! (...believes!)",Original Broadway Cast of The Book of Mormon,1982,"[94, 55, 33, 33, 37, 41, 48, 54, 64, 73, 83]",11

Does it go this way
Why, why, why

425,If Looks Could Kill,"[Verse 1]
Something's wrong and it's not me for once
And I know you'll call me crazy
But I hate the way you look straight through me
What have I done that's so wrong?
Remember me, when I'm so far from your reach
When you'll know you had your chance
Take one more glance, and that's the end of our romance

[Chorus]
You've turned your back on me for the last time

[Verse 2]
Remember when we use to be friends?
Nothing could ever go wrong, or so we thought
But I guess you've changed a lot since we were young
Times will change, and there's nothing I can say
To right all of your wrongs
Just grow up, and pray we'll keep in touch

[Chorus]
You've turned your back on me for the last time

[Verse 3]
I still dream of the day that I watched you choke
They'll act like I'm so crazy
When they find you dead on my floor
Right now, right now

I'd say something went wrong in our lives
And I pray that god saves us before we die

431,The Longer You Wait,"You're young and in love
And you think it's just enough
To keep you satisfied until forever
But what good is love
When it keeps you out of touch
With the very things that keep it all together

The longer you wait
The days are getting shorter
The farther your drift from the shore
The longer you wait
To rise and look around you
It may not be there anymore

You say you're seventeen
And you swear you've got a dream
And if the wind is right it's gonna find you
But what good is a dream
Without a dream machine
To take you through the obstacles that bind you

The longer you wait
The days are getting shorter
The farther your drift from the shore
The longer it takes
To rise and look around you
It may not be there anymore

Don't need his arms to hold you tight (hold you tight)
Oh yes those arms can hold you right
Don't let his dry those clear blue eyes
Cause you know he's gonna getcha, you know my sweet Loretta
You know he's gonna let down in the end end

The longer you wait
The days are getting shorter
The farther your drift from the shore
So don't hesitate
To rise and look around you
Just pick yourself up off the floor

Came a long way from G'burg
Puttin' in work like Ferg

I'm the motherfuckin' man, 'least I'm feelin' like I am
Got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
But don't give a goddamn, I'm Sam-I-Am
What that even mean? I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Why nowadays everybody got a palm out?

I know you been waitin' for this world to collide
B. O. double B. Y., H. A. L. L., and Folarin
'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean
I am no historian, but here to make my predecessors proud
All you bitch niggas not allowed?
I put it on everything, I really want a cop out
But I did good for a dropout
Hop out the coupe, chicken heads go crazy
Gotta sound swag when the flow get lazy

Anybody steppin' to me, promise they get shit on

Did it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot

Voice on the radio, voice on the radio)

Well late a lonely evening, the sound on the radio
The musics not my style, so I move the dial
Pick up a station that I didn't know
His voice was so appealin, caught me with his sweet talkin lines
As his yells went by, I couldve known the guy
I was on his wave length and he was on mine

A voice on the radio, keeps turnin me on
A voice on the radio, keeps turnin me on

Next day I wrote a letter, care of his duty oh
I said that he was the best, asked if he played requests
Sent him my number and a recent photo
Not only got a mention, he phoned me to say hello
But before I had time to lay my heart on the line
The song was over and he had to go

Chorus:
A voice on the radio, keeps turnin me on
A voice on the radio, talkin to me every evening
A voice on the radio, keeps turnin me on

If he forgets me forever, Im just another girl on a photograph on his wall
Ill make a person to person call

I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me

With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew Id never want to leave
Sometimes Im a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you light my nights
Somehow Id get by

Is you don't belong to me

And even though I'm not with you
I need you so
But you don't belong to me

'cause I don't need to touch you
To feel you, it's so real with you

I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time

Just can't be found

Is turning up-side-down

And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard ""Can't Get Enough""
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, ""The Things Hoes Say""
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable

[Verse 2]
And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like ""Don't you know this shit already?""
""Nigga, ain't you rich already?""
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho
Had a nigga baby, little mans don’t know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
""Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?""
Whoa

[Chorus]
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
I take it to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man

455,Perhaps Love,"Perhaps love is like a resting place
A shelter from the storm, it exists to give you comfort
It is there to keep you warm, and in those times of trouble
When you are most alone, the memory of love will bring you home

Perhaps love is like a window
Perhaps an open door, it invites you to come close
It wants to show you more, and even if you lose yourself
And don't know what to do the memory of love will see you through

Oh, love to some is like a cloud
To some as strong as steel, for some a way of living
For some a way to feel, and some say love is holding on
Some say letting go, some say love is everything
And some say they don't know

Perhaps love is like the ocean full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when its cold outside, or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever and all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you

And some say love is holding on
Some say letting go, and some say love is everything
And some say they don't know

Perhaps love is like the ocean full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when it's cold outside or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever and all my dreams come true

It's gotta get better than this

Patti packed her bags
Left a note for her mama

There were tears in her eyes
When she kissed her little sister goodbye

They held each other tight
As they drove on through the night
They were so excited

Let's take it while we're still not afraid

Because life is so brief
And time is a thief, when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand
It can slip right through your hands

Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?

You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', ""How so?""
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me

[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya.

I got a notion maybe I'll stick around
And oh
I can never doubt you for too long
I can't see no reason
You're my kinda lover

When you come 'round I never get down
I fly across the floor
I can see you comin' on me
And I can't ask for more
Rock me, sock me
Baby you got me ridin' to the end
Rake me, shake me
Baby you make me turn me on again

You got my motor racin'
I find my thoughts embracin' your every move
I wanna set you reelin'
I wanna make you feel the way that I do
And oh
I been thinkin' 'bout you for so long
I don't wanna lose ya
You're my kinda lover",Billy Squier,1982,"[90, 65, 45, 46, 51]",5
483,"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)","Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long

Ever since she left me
I sure feel all alone
A little misunderstanding
I can't get her on the telephone

Hanging out down on Main Street
Living in a different world
Standing around
With the gang on the corner
Talking about my girl

My girl, she was the world to me
She's gone all the way across the sea
My girl is just a memory
She been so long anyway

Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long

She didn't have to leave me
She didn't have to run
She didn't have to go
Without a word to anyone

I hope she's doing all right
Got no way to know
Unless she gets to hear this song
Hear it on the radio

My girl, she was the world to me
She's gone and that's a tragedy
My girl is just a memory
She been so long anyway

Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long

Well, I hope she gets the message
Gotta get her back you know
Gonna track her down, I'll find that girl
Gonna tell her that I love her so

Put the word on the grapevine
Spread it all around the world
Sooner or later, I know I'm gonna get her
Talkin' about my girl, my girl

484,If I Were You,"[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже

[Куплет 1]
Когда мы были кореша
Мы разбежались, неизбежно бабки крутят этот шар
Холодная сталь оставляет шрам
У одних вызывает страх, другим даёт свой шанс
Жизнь даёт вам шанс, хватай его сейчас
Мне не нужен твой барыга, оставь его себе на чай
Говорил тебе, парень, с самого начала
Твоя сука зашла «ВКонтакт» и всё себе скачала
Как она кричала, боже, как кончала
Она вся протекла, и ей походу мало
Нет, нет, нет, тебе не поможет мама
Да, да, да, я забрал тебя так рано
Теперь мой счёт прибавил пару нулей
Но я никогда не менял бабки на людей
Бабки - на людей, братьев - на блядей
Ты сучья гнида, мы словимся попозже, всё окей

[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже

[Куплет 2]
Сука, ты выродок, сука, ты выблядок
Никто не будет терпеть тебя, никто не будет терпеть твоих выходок
Ты живёшь ради выгоды, мы живём ради выхлопа
Все ваши рэперы в сторонке тихо и нервно курят у выхода
Я нажимаю на «Play» — играет Big Daddy Kane
И, сука, так каждый день, да, мама, я – бэнгер
И мы, словно, бля, в танке, мы заходим за рамки
Ты продался давно, оставь своё музло на платной стоянке
Многие хотят делать этот трэп-щит
Я не слышу их, мэн, кто там пищит?
Просто пойми, ты предназначен для других целей
И просто пойми, мы знаем всю правду, увидишь всё в свете
Эти дети говорят о том, чего никогда не видели в жизни
Посмотри на себя, думаешь, бог приготовил для тебя именно это?
Толкать наркоту на районе? Нет, парень, это не так
Возьми всё в свое руки, будь одержим

[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже",Kizaru,1982,"[92, 58, 44, 45, 46]",5

This is the be all, the end all
The burden, the blessing
This is the be all, the end all
The burden, the blessing

I've made promises that I know I can't keep
Drink from the holy grail, you'll find it's bittersweet
No matter what he says, poison is not my friend
But he'll have my back until the bitter end

Always climbing but only ever descending
The canvas before me is never-ending

[Verse 2]
All my mistakes will outlive me
I just can't accept that what will be will be

But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose

Always climbing but only ever descending
The canvas before me is never-ending

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods

I wasted time building castles in the air

You've turned angry and cold
You say it's an illusion
There's no fire in your soul
Say you don't love me
Say you don't care
But don't leave me standing here
Your heart's like a wheel
Just waiting to roll
It's longing for freedom
To get out on the road
You're hungry for something
That you may never find
So many reasons
Your love has made you blind
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
So don't leave me standing here
Don't leave me standing here
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
Don't leave me
Don't leave me standing here
Life ain't been easy
Full of passion and pain
Told me no reason
Why I was to blame

We're not supposed to touch

492,Those Good Old Dreams,"As a child I was known for make believing
All alone I created fantasies
As I grew people called it self-deceiving
But my heart helped me hold the memories

As I walk through the world I find around me
Something new yet familiar's in the air, I feel it everywhere
Like a child's eyes on a Christmas night
I'm looking at you now, finding answers to my prayers

It's a new day for those good old dreams
One by one it seems they're coming true
Here's the morning that my heart had seen
Here's the morning that just had to come through

Same old stage but what a change of scene
No more dark horizons only blue
It's a new day for those good old dreams
All my life I've dreamed of loving you

You're a spark of a long forgotten fire
You're a touch of a slowly growing wind
You're a taste of the ever changing seasons
Telling me there are some things that don't end

We have left all the darkness far behind us
All those hopes that we held along the way, have made it to this day
Like an old love song, gone for much too long
You hear it once again and it carries you away

It's a new day for those good old dreams
One by one it seems they're coming true
Here's the morning that my heart had seen
Here's the morning that just had to come through

Same old stage but what a change of scene
No more dark horizons only blue
It's a new day for those good old dreams
All my life I've dreamed of you

And it's all because of you",Carpenters,1982,"[93, 63, 64, 72]",4

Down the mountainside
To the coastline
Past the angry tide
The mighty diesel whines

And the tunnel comes
And the tunnel goes
Round another bend
The giant drivers roll
I rode the Highball
I fired the Daylight
When I turned sixty-five
I couldn't see right
It was ""Mr. Jones
We've got to let you go
It's company policy
You've got a pension though""

Roll on, Southern Pacific
On your silver rails
On your silver rails
Roll on, Southern Pacific
On your silver rails
Through the moonlight

Hope and pray she'll say that she's willing to give us another try
And if all those plans I made don't melt the lady's heart
I'll put on the old 45's

And maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
Maybe the old lines will sound new
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
Maybe old feelings will come through
Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away
Maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
And make her wanna stay

It's been too long since I've seen her face light up when I come home
It's been too many hours I've wasted staring at the phone
Sweet old songs I'm counting on you to bring her back to me
I'm tired of listening alone

And maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
Maybe the old lines will sound new
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
Maybe old feelings will come through
Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away
Maybe the old songs'll bring back the old times
And make her wanna stay",Barry Manilow,1982,"[96, 74, 53, 43]",4

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City

Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City

500,Tryin' To Live My Life Without You,"I used to smoke five packs of cigarettes a day
It was the hardest thing to put them away
I drank four or five bottles of wine
I kept a glass in my hand all the time

Breakin' those habits
Was hard to do
But nothin' compared to the changes
That you put me through

Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared
It was the hardest burden I'll ever bear

I had the worst reputation in town
For chasing all the women around
I thought changin' my way of living was hard to do
But it's nothin' compared to the changes that you put me through

I've done everything I tried to do
But it's gonna take a miracle to get me over you

Tryin' to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Tryin' to forget the love we once shared
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear",Bob Seger,1982,"[91, 66, 53]",3
501,Better Things,"[Intro]
Don't give a fuck about your man
I'm just seeing what it's hitting for (bitch I'm sayin')
How you fronting on the kid though?
You should fuck with me girl, you know what you need, girl
See I got used to livin' life up on my own, yeah
In search of love and for a wife to call my own, yeah
It's all I think about at nights when I'm alone, yeah
Swear that I can't get no rest in California

[Verse 1]
Swear that life is, just a whole bunch of vices
Niggas biting off of my shit, my dick
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license
Tell her hold on like some vice grips
Might just call her, let her ride with a baller
Look up on her face was priceless
Wonder what my type is, well, tonight Mrs. Lightskin
With a light mix or a light switch, white chick
Darkskin complexion and she righteous
I take a dyke chick if she like dick
I kissed the dyke chick and I liked it
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch, light this

[Chorus]
Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Bless, sit back and relax one time, clear your mind
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)
'Bout to send me back to my old ways, know what I'm saying?
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Yeah, I'm just, she making mistakes
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

[Bridge]
I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs

[Verse 2]
I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce
Ride with a nigga mane, and you know
I stay fly like the jigga mane, and it figures
Cause here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes
Guess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts

[Chorus]
Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things)
Inhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

502,The Theme From Hill Street Blues,"[Intro: Havoc]
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, that true shit
That shit to make you feel shit
To all my niggas and my bitches
Yo, check it, uh huh

[Verse 1: Havoc]
It's kinda bug how I dose sometimes; know they staring
Brain feels like a wheel lost without the ball bearing
Stuck, contemplating who I can trust
But like llello in a bill my feelings just get crushed
But thats why I stick with my duns, like I stick with the guns
Don't get mad, rip your hun, concentrate on my funds
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist
Never get patted down when I step in the place
Jiggied up, scope the spot, confirm beef, if it's not
Bally up, after this get followed straight to the crib
Gem star, double edge apply pressure
Shave 'em down, blow marks intruding through your mecca
Wanna be a thug, now you got the thug look
Stick 'em up, leave Medicaid with the bill to foot
God-Body, with a rubber grip black shottie
Pump one in that ass make a nigga switch hobbies
A dosage, hand delivered, without postage
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice
Niggas get sniped like, clog your bronchite
Show 'em how to rock right, when bitches are holdin mics
(Street life)

[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (street life)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues
This is real, this is ill street news
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck
And now his brother not giving a fuck
Little sister giving up the butt now, dun don't wet that
I want you to rest black, 'cause you can believe that Noyd gon' handle that
Cause when I get 'em, I'm gonna have 'em
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at 'em
I'm no killer, you know me
But I'll be damned if I don't ride for my co-D
And then this OG, scold me, and told me, coldly
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homie
But I, gotta redeem, get this cream by any means
I never been clean
Nigga, my whole click got dirty
From the vials, to the trials and the bloodied up syrtie
Nigga you heard me, it's gangsta (and to the block)

[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (and to the block)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Vision the canvas I paint a picture
Similar to Ernies Barnes, nigga
But mines is more ghetto more guns
More drugs, mostly thugs
All my dunns, their baby moms daughter and sons
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out
Park benches is broke, a nigga stretched out
Jumped off the roof and fell to his death, it's real
Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murals
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building
Devil's Spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing
Grams get dipped, 50's is moked, cookies is broke
And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off, don't get clipped off
(Street life)

[Chorus: Chinky (Prodigy)]
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete
For how long only time will say
Forever you a part of me (street life)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me (and to my dunns)
Why'd you have to raise me this way?

503,Just Once,"[Verse 1]
I've lost count
Of how many times we've disagreed
But it's the third time
We've fought together this week
Maybe it's nothin', maybe I just need time on my own
Just once
I'm gonna go and get drunk

[Pre-Chorus]
If you get my name wrong, I won't get pissed off
'Cause I wish I was somebody else
You know nothin' about me, I know nothin' about you

We could get lost
I wanna get lost
Have you ever been lost?
We could get lost
I wanna get lost

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure
If I'm just thinkin' 'bout it too much
Or if I'm just lookin'
For an excuse for us to break up
Maybe I want to, maybe I need to
Find a way to tell you that I wanna let you go
Just once
I'm gonna go and get drunk

If you get my name wrong, I won't get pissed off
'Cause I wish I was somebody else
You know nothin' about me, I know nothin' about you

504,Poor Man's Son,"Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son
Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son

My father is a hard earned worker; my mother has a heart of gold
I was never much younger but I feel twice as old

Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son
Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son

But I've got money for food and a little bit of gasoline
I've got plenty of time but I want everything now
But I don't need no gold or silver
Oh I only need a few new things
Or I would buy pearls for my lover
Or just a brand new set of guitar strings

Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son
Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son

I feel a cold wind blowing;
Dark clouds form on the western sky
I've got a feeling like knowing that everyone here will someday die

Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son
Stone cold broke in the middle of the winter, oh like a poor man's son

And I see the bright stars shining high above the Bethlehem tower;
I hear the chorus of angels singing out loud the sweetest sound

Oh brothers, let's go down
Let's go down, won't you come on down?
Oh brother, let's go down
Down in the river to pray

Oh sisters, let's go down
Let's go down, won't you come on down?
Oh sister, let's go down
Down in the river to pray

Oh family, let's go down
Let's go down, won't you come on down?
Oh family, let's go down
Down in the river to pray

But I don't need no gold or silver
Oh I only need a few new things
Or I would buy pearls for my lover
Or just a brand new set of guitar strings",Noah Gundersen,1982,"[95, 60, 55]",3
505,Never Too Much,"[Verse 1]
I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

[Chorus]
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

[Verse 2]
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

[Outro]
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much",Luther Vandross,1982,"[96, 62, 50]",3

Wrack my brain, wrack my brain
Till my head's filled with pain
Wrack my brain

All dried up, i'm all dried up
All i have's this empty cup
All dried up

What i have, you don't want
What you want, i can't give
I got out of touch with you and yours
The way that you live

I try to do my best for you
While the sky pours down the rain
Wrack my brain

With a will there's a way
But there's no way i can see
Coming up with something you'd enjoy
As much as Tv

All the same, i play the game
Up and down old memory lane

It's all give and take, and you just take, and I can't take it, you see
I'm giving up on love this time
Me and my friends we'll do just fine

I've done everything for you
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

You said someday I'd have a whole lotta money
I'd be a millionaire
But when that didn't happen overnight
I found out how much you really cared
All you want is a whole lotta money
All the rest is just jiving honey

I've done everything for you
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

When I first met you, you didn't know how to love a man
All those things about making love, you didn't understand
Now you know about everything
I'm turning you in for memories

I've done everything for you
I've done everything for you

I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

[Chorus 1]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus 2]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

[Chorus 2]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood

Where do they go when they've done their time
Wearing their hearts out on the line for all to see
Must be the gypsy in their soul

[Instrumental]

She's built, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like

[Verse 3]
Her body measurements are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure
That's sure enough paying attention
She's poetry in motion
A beautiful sight to see
I get so excited viewing her anatomy

[Pre-Chorus]
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like

[Chorus]
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be",Carl Carlton,1982,"[96, 87]",2
517,For Your Eyes Only,"For your eyes only, can see me through the night
For your eyes only, I never need to hide
You can see so much in me
So much in me that's new
I never felt, until I looked at you

For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The love I know you need in me
The fantasy you freed in me
Only for you, only for you

For your eyes only, the nights are never cold
You really know me, that's all I need to know
Maybe I'm an open book
Because I know you're mine
But you won't need to read between the lines

For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The passions that collide in me
The wild abandoned side of me
Only for you, for your eyes only",Sheena Easton,1982,"[98, 90]",2

My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright
My first love

You're every step I make

I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do

Your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care

Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever

519,Hard To Say,"[Verse 1]
Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other

[Chorus 1]
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

[Chorus 2]
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

[Verse 2]
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day, from your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away, from the one that I love

[Chorus 1]
Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know

[Chorus 1]
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

[Chorus 2]
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise to
And after all that's been said and done

I will make it up to you, I promise to
You're going to be the lucky one

(Get Away)
When we get there gonna jump in the air
No one'll see us because there's nobody there
After all, you know we really don't care
Hold on, I'm going to take you there",Chicago,1982,[96],1
520,Controversy,"[Verse 1]
I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cuz you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - ""What have I got to lose?""

[Chorus]
And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

[Verse 2]
I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - ""Baby, have you got enough gas?""
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Yes you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last (Oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

[Chorus 2]
Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down (Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red corvette right in the ground
(Little Red Corvette)
Right down to the ground (Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down
(Little Red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

[Breakdown]
Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow!
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a limousine
Ow!

[Chorus]
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
(Little Red Corvette)

[Chorus 2]
Babe, you got too slow down (you got too slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
You're gonna run your body right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)

521,"I Want You, I Need You","I know for sure that you will never change, oh-oh-ooh
Why I continue to love you
The answer remains the same, oh-oh-ooh

Why do I, do I cry
When I know nothing will change?
But if I, keep holding on
Then maybe you'll see that I

I do want you, I do need you
I do want you, I do need you

Deep in my hear-ar-ar-ar-art
I feel that you really do care-are-are, ooh
Is it true what they say?
That our actions speak louder than words
And yours just isn't there, oh oh-oh-ooh

Why do I, do I cry
When I know nothing will change?
But if I, keep holding on
Then maybe you'll see that I

I do want you, I do need you
I do want you, I do need you

I do want you, I do need you
I do want you, I do need you

I do want you, I do need you
I do want you, I do need you

I do want you, I do need you",Bobby Brown,1982,[98],1
522,Twilight,"[Verse 1]
In 7th Grade, we promised that we'd never break each other's heart
Fought with the pressure of deep depression while naked making confessions
Underneath the covers, coloring in the dark
Gave LaToya my information and she ain't even call
Could it be women's intuition telling her I'm a dog?
Criminally involved, past-tense on my prior history dealing with the law
And this is no facade, refrigerator in my chest just like Omarion
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Excuse - that's just a broken heart
I'll think that I'll just hang out here for tonight
(Say Gates, what you doing?)
Playing songs on my invisible guitar

[Hook]
Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

[Verse 2]
Every time we talk, it's like you end up getting aroused
Standing, while I'm sitting down with my fingers under your blouse
Still looking you in the eye, you're looking back into mine
If I told you I was different, would you understand the difference?
Try to suppress the feeling of this different way of living
Creatures of the night - we gon be alright
In the twilight
Skin gleamin', labeled a demon cause I can't even die
The curse of eternity - God created me, but why?
If I turn you into I, your age would never age and forever be by my side
Spoke about the wisdom that entered into my thoughts
The will of the universe, including the Willendorf
This is art
I'm a God

[Hook]
Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

I would go to war with God...to war with God, to war with God..",Kevin Gates,1982,[99],1
523,Sharing The Love,"Take it from me, I've had the experience
Finding the right love ain't easy to do
I've been looking and looking and searching around since
Nature started teching me just what to do

I can feel it bubbling up
All this love needs somewhere to live
Come and take a drink from my cup
I have a heart with so much to give

All the love is here so take it
Darlin' you know we can make it

I knew the minute I saw you
You were the one who'd be
Sharin' the love
I have the feeling inside me
You'll be beside me
Sharin' the love

I never believed in love at first sight
It's a foolish dreamer's fantasy
But one look at you showed me the light
And made a foolish dreamer of me

I can feel it bubbling up
All this love needs somewhere to live
Come and take a drink from my cup
I have a heart with so much to give

All the love is here so take it
It would be a sin to waste it

I knew the minute I saw you
You were the one who'd be
Sharin' the love
I have the feeling inside me
You'll be beside me
Sharin' the love",Rufus,1982,[100],1
