1,Saturday Night,"[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)",Khalid,1975,"[2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 17, 27, 36, 44, 55, 75, 85]",12

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Verse 1]
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our mind
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

[Verse 2]
Now looking back on all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to our those questions can be?

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for?

What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

Now when I look out through your eyes
I'm young again, even though I'm very old

And gives your spirit to take a chance
And I wrote some rock 'n' roll so you can move

It's from you, it's from me
It's a worldwide symphony

And rigs of every size

And eleven long haired Friends of Jesus

And all the others in between

Put them away in your mind
For memories are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow

The seasons are passing one by one
So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life

Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today

Ain't never been my idea
Of getting it on
But the job demands
That you make new plans
Before your big chance is gone

You get a house in the hills
You're paying everyones bills
And they tell you that
You're gonna go far
But in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is that who you really are

You got your feet in L.A
But your mind's on Tennessee
Looking back, I can
Remember the time
When I sang my songs for free

You got your feet in L.A
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then
My heart keeps going home

Talking on the telephone
Setting up another day
Of people to meet
You've gotta do what's right
You've gotta spend the night
Staying in touch with the street

When you're surrounded by friends
They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out
Cause in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is this what its all about

You got your feet in L.A
But your mind's on Tennessee
Looking back, I can

16,Walk Away From Love,"(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

[Verse 1]
It's not that I don't love you
You know how much I do
And it's not that I've found someone
To take the place of you
It's just a fear that builds within me
Every time you touch my hand
And a dread that shakes my body
That even I don't understand

[Chorus]
So I'm leaving (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love, breaks my heart

(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

[Verse 2]
Ooo, you're clinging to me tighter
Than you ever have before, I don't understand it
But I know it's gonna take everything I've got
To keep walking out the door
But those arms you've got around me
Will let me go some day
And I'd rather leave you holding on
Than pushing me away

[Chorus]
So I'm leaving, yes I am (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love, breaks my heart

(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

17,The Last Game Of The Season (A Blind Man In The Bleachers),"He's just the blind man in the bleachers
To the local home town fans
And he sits beneath the speakers
Way back in the stands
And he listens to the play by play
He's just waiting for one name
He wants to hear his son get in the game

But the boy's not just a hero
He's strictly second team
Tho he runs each night for touchdowns
In his father's sweetest dreams
He's gonna be a star some day
Tho you might never tell
But the blind man in the bleachers knows he will

And the last game of the season is a Friday night at home
And no one knows the reason but the blind man didn't come
And his boy looks kinda nervous
Sometimes turns around and stares
Just as tho' he sees the old man sittin' there

The local boys are tryin' but they slowly lose their will
Another player's down and now
He's carried from the field
At halftime in the locker room
The kid goes off alone
And no one sees him talkin' on the phone

The game's already started
When he gets back to the team
And half the crowd can hear his coach yell
""Where the hell you been?""
""Just gettin' ready for the second half,""
Is all he'll say
""Cause now you're gonna let me in to play.""

Without another word, he turns and runs into the game
And through the silence on the field
Loudspeakers call his name
It'll make the local papers
How the team came from behind
When they saw him playin' his heart to win

And when the game was over
The coach asked him to tell
What was it he was thinkin' of
That made him play so well
""You knew my dad was blind,"" he said
""Tonight he passed away""
""It's the first time that my father's seen me play""",David Geddes,1975,"[18, 18, 22, 26, 30, 36, 44]",7
18,Sing A Song,"[Verse 1]
When you feel down and out
Sing a song (it'll make your day)
For you, it's the time to shout

Sometimes it's hard to care
Sing a song (it'll make your day)
A smile so hard to bear
Sing a song (it'll make a way)

Could you tell me?

When we had a black president
D4 and 5, we got back to business

I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA

Damn, I wish I drank a lil more water
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder
Damn, I pull up with a redbone, scarlet
With a yellowbone car
That smoke green, that's Marley
Purple and the orange, you seen, that's horror
No Eve in my garden, F-R-uh, F-R-uh
All the Gs in my corner, them boys so warriors
Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Kis and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins

I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'

We're good and we're evil, which one will I be today?

There's saints and sinners
Life's a gamble and you might lose
There's cowards and heroes
Both have been known now to break the rules
There's lovers and haters
The strong and the weak will all have their day
We're devils and angels
Which one will I be today?

Chorus:
Are you happy now with all the choices you've made?
Are there times in life when you know you should've stayed?
Will you compromise and then realize the price is too much to pay?
Winners and losers, which one will you be today?

There's a light and a dark side
Standing at the crossroads, there we'll meet
There's prophets and fools there
The lies and the truths, will be at our feet
I got a reason to turn my head and look the other way
Its heaven and hell here, which one will I live today?

Chorus:
Are you happy now with all the choices you've made?
Are there times in life when you know you should've stayed?
Did you compromise and then realize the price is too much to pay?
Winners and losers, which one will you be today?

Which one will you be today?

32,School Boy Crush,"Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four
Wait till everybody's (long) gone
There must be so many things that we can explore
Maybe I can walk you home
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter
I'd like to hold your little hand
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter
We'll get to know each other if we can

Chorus
She said hey - wait a minute - hold on
She said hey - just a little bit - hold on
When ever I try to think of what it feels like to feel it
For the frst time, and was it really such a thrill
She said look, boy - but don't you touch

That ain't much - only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret - can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance
(But) we should take it rather slow
If we play it cool - It'll be all right
Don't let the teacher see us talking
But after school we will be out of sight
Everybody gonna think we just gone walkin'

I can't believe it's true
Girl, there's just no living
Without you

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
Cause if you go then I'll be blue
Breaking up is hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

[Chorus]
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up, I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you, don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love just one more try
Come on baby, let's start anew
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is oh so hard to do",Neil Sedaka,1975,"[34, 59, 79]",3

Они любят эту моду, эту моду я убил
Занаксы и кодеин и я грустный как пиздец
Каждая таблетка приближает мой конец

Я убийца моды, но ношу самый модный бренд

I wake up in the mornin'
Tell you what I see on my TV screen
I see the blood of an innocent child
And everybody's watchin'

Now I'm looking out my window
And what do I see?
I see an army of a soldier man
Marching across the street, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hey, Mr. Soldier man
Tomorrow is the day you go to war
But you are fighting for another man's cause
And you don't even know him

Ooo...!
What did he say to make you so blind
To your conscience and reason?
Could it be love for your country?
Or for the gun you use in killing?

[Chorus]
So... there is fire on the mountain
And nobody seems to be on the run
Oh, there is fire on the mountain top
And no one is a runnin'

[Verse 3]
Hey, Mr. Lover man
Can I get a chance to talk to you?
'Cause you are fooling with a dead man's corpse
And you don't know what you do

So you say you have a lover
And you love her like no other
So you buy her a diamond that someone has died on
Don't you think there something wrong with this?

[Verse 4]
Tell me!
Who's responsible for what we teach our children?
Is it the Internet or the stars on television?
Why? Oh why? Why? Oh, Why? Oh!

So little Lucy turns sixteen
And like the movie she's been seeing
She has a lover in her daddy
She can't tell nobody till she makes the evening news

For there is fire on the mountain
And there is nobody seems to be on the run
Oh, there is fire on the mountain top
And no one is a runnin', oh yes

And there'll be no where for us to go
And we will run, run
Wishing we had put out the fire, oh!!!

And there ain't nobody seems to be on the run
Nobody, nobody, oh!
Oh, there is fire on the mountain top
And no one is a runnin', so, yeah, yeah, yeah

Tu vieni un giorno con me

[Strofa 1]
Viaggio levitando come un fachiro
Tu stai screditando la famiglia amico
Sguinzaglio la mia dipendenza dalla gadro
Frà 'sti pacchi in giro fan lo sbirro ladro
Fumo le fumo l'essenza
Nuvole, nuvole e nebbia
In giro ho le brugole per chi ha bisogno
Io metto a posto e lo stato mi ferma
Faccio lo stesso che non m'interessa
Posto di blocco: pezzi di merda
Piuttosto la butto dal terzo a P-Terra
Piuttosto mi butto che scappo nell'erba
E questi fan brutto ma mai come me
Lo sanno tutti, pure la tua zozza
Se faccio le zozze sul pezzo
È perchè devo sporcarti l'orecchio per forza
E tu vieni con me che ti conviene
Che vedrai un giorno con me ti diverti
Come quel tifoso all'inizio di un derby
Con me sei schifoso: una pressa
Comprendi?

[Strofa 2]
Quando mi scrivi quelle cose sai che non è vero
Che mi fomenti tanto per, ma lo vorresti dietro
Son fatto per non ascoltarti, tanto che vorresti?
Tu non ti ascolti e dai pareri come se sapessi
Io che ti scopo giusto proprio perché non capisci
Che ti confondi in due secondi
Vuoi la canna e il Riesling
Dopo ti offendi che provi a colpirmi
Ma ti riprendi? Dovresti coprirti!
Fra' per la strada continuo a colpire
Sto con la bandana e non mi piace che scoppi gli scarsi
Aperitivo con gli anacardi
Dopo le scrivo se vuole beccarsi
Sta fuori al bar con il suo bacardi
Sta con gli amici, non ha voglia di fare se stessa
Poi si allontana per fare se stessa
Sopra di me, me pari una leonessa
Lascio le pare per due ore, dopo le riacchiappo
Questa va via col culo rosso: impronta dello schiaffo
Faccio ""Un, due, tre"" però al due scappo
Faccio ""Vroom Vroom Vroom"" con il booster marcio
Ti fotto bene non mi vedi più
Ti ho scopato bene, forse troppo, non ti levi più
Ti ho firmato i Levi's, dopo i leggins non li levi più
Senti il mio profumo ovunque quindi non ti lavi più

PK Thunder, Make it rain, you ain't never gonna be the same (uh huh)
When you witness the usage of all my power drains
Had to make them EarthBound cause you know I'm really Onett
And I bring a lot of flare (yep), let's PK honest

[Verse 7: metaphist - Olimar/Eminem (Slim Shady)]
Slim Oli, yo!
I'm an alien witta ship
I crash landed, broke the whip
I'm tryin' to get a grip, but I can't figure out which Pikmin is which (Too many colors!)
Even though I've got all these henchmen I still feel like ish (Tell 'em why!)
Cause all of these other characters are taller than me by, like, three fifths
Throws are legit, but my up-smash is my favorite to kill with
Go ahead, D.I. all you want (do it), there's still gonna be an ""E"" at the end of it (Bitch! Ha ha!)
You wanna melee? Forget it, I'd rather get lifted than fall
The only way they got me to brawl is cause they promised me there'd be tripping involved


[Verse 8: J.ME the Sista' Danius - Sheik (Zelda)/Nicki Minaj]
I might not be a queen, but I'm definitely a princess
Who you think you are tryin' to claim my riches?
You're a bum who mows lawns for rupees
And thinks flutes will make me wanna be your groupie, dude, please!
Gimme the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts (uhn!)
Running the gauntlet, uh huh, Sheik-ah! (Woop!)
Apparently you only lay pipes for Epona
Either way this Ship has sailed, ARRRGH, Tetra!

(Rap Solo)

[01. Intro]

[Kase.O: Intro]
Yeah! Lo que estás escuchando es Tutorial: La Mixtape
Javato Jones y Ambur Laineg en el edificio
¡Díselo bro!
Yeah, 2015, 2016, esto no para, co, esto no para

[Scratches R de Rumba]
Javat afecta, Rumba selecta (x4)
This is how it should be done
Puliendome a tontolabas, sin esfuerzo
This is how it should be done
(Kase.O) How can one man posess so much power?
This is how it should be done
True master, the teacher, that's right el maestro
This is how it should be done
Sobrazo de estilazo estoy puedes verlo
This is how it should be done
Todo un simbolo en el rap, después discute mi caché
This is how it should be done
Microphone master, super rhyme maker
This is how it should be done
(¡Qué bueno!) Rey del estilo, Kase.O
This is how it should be done
So however, wherever, whenever, heffer

[02. Eric B and Rakim - I Know You Got Soul]

[Kase.O] (Rap Solo Studio)

[Verso 1]
It’s been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I’m sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating, you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
So you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance with the speaker till you hear it blow
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a four letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, and let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck with
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up with
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def with the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can't dance, just clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I’m trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

[Hook]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul

[Verso 2]
Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I’m on Soul Train
But I wait cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I’ll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, cause that’s the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
(This is how it should be done) (x7)
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

[Hook]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Hey, hey, aquí chiqui chiqui chs, chiqui xhelazz
Ambur Laineg, Javato Jones
Máximo Respeto, co
Rap real, no fake. Tutorial ¡La Mixtape!

[FranFueTheFirst: Verso 1]
Mirad allá arriba al MC, dícese del que define
Aquel que solo presume, sé que rima tuves con su troupé
El que de lunes a lunes desune nubes de mugre
Cubre tu cumbre y se asume a tu muchedumbre
Al que para los del ca de blanco
Siéndoos francos Solo los jodo por no ser actor a tu ley
Poli hazme caso no comentes esto con tu mujer
Divergel, me dejé con ella en noches de gel
Así de fácil MTV, [?]
Mientras MCs sienten decir entre si, hoy es muy dificil su símil
Porque el feeling carga bien su sillín
Por eso estoy aquí, raps de mi ""rapdiaboli""
Que MC's de mierda montan las más guapas partys
Seduzco a tu chati y a su papi, rompemos ratings
Quitadme el lápiz, improvisando tanto rapper saben que mi canto
En cuanto saco mi metrallo, [?]
Mi actividad me ha hecho happy
Mi amistad con Javi me ha dictado
Que los bardos más heavys, más hippies, más prolíficos son piscis
Common también entra dentro de esta estadística, pero en fin
Estamos en el Spanish Tatami, to' el Dream Team
El resto en un momento dado es: A mi plin
Coge la rima y no la suelta como Erik B
De crio caí en la marmita como Obelix
Yo os libro de un vaso infinito
En harás el ridículo, hálito de MC's canijos
Pródigos en barcos, párrafos
Más no olvido que este príncipe en tiempo fue un sapo

[Hook] (x2)
MCs de mierda creen que saben rimar
MCs de mierda dan mal nombre al rap
MCs de mierda sin autoestima pa' copiar
MCs de mierda sois lo peor dejadlo ya

[Xhelazz: Verso 2]
Smoking Robinson, más Cruz que Penelope Cara
No matemático, no más mates que ya mal más [?]
Esta es mi secta, mi línea recta, Xhelazz te la inserta
Adicto a escribir en crisis de ahí que ahora comparo rimas
Las que nada dicen o las que te dictan las lágrimas
Si de unas a las otras la diferencia es abismal
Cloaka, su primer disco, el Hip Hop sufrirá reformas
Gota tras gota, la gota hará agujero en la roca
Vengo del planeta ""hardcorequiano"" que yo mismo defino
Siempre fui al revés del mundo, por nada me declino
Creí que era de noche estando a la sombra del pino
Pensé que era de día cuando la luz de las estrellas me iluminó
Mi estado moral metamórfico me transformó en meticuloso de métricas
Soy un cosmopolita en las técnicas
Vivo en un desierto pero mejor si soy optimista, ¿verdad?
Me consuelo imaginándome una playa sin mar
Mucha gente habla sola cuando en el váter caga su mierda
Si el váter es el que te habla, eso se llama esquizofrenia
Mi benevolencia es un pájaro herido por las envidias
Mujer, tú me querías, ¿por qué ahora de mi ni te fías?
Hacemos rap en la calle, ¿Sabes? O bajo tu ventana
El agua que chorrea en tus bragas tendidas nos hidrata
No eres tan fea como crees cuando te miras al espejo
Te eché una mano para complacerte y me sobraron 4 dedos
Co, tú eres mi flor y yo el florero con la facultad de florecer flows

[Hook] (x2)
MCs de mierda creen que saben rimar
MCs de mierda dan mal nombre al rap
MCs de mierda sin autoestima pa' copiar
MCs de mierda sois lo peor dejadlo ya

[Erik Beeler: Verso 3]
Tú coge la pana, yo levantaré la mano al sonar la campana
Tú habla, acapara
Pon la cara, yo pondré en tus narices una de mis cagadas
Sin mediar palabra
Tú consigue la fama, yo a mis movidas endiabladas
Atento aquí, traga
Sostén conmigo una mirada, vas del palo, co, vas de maca
Tu protege lo que tienes como si me importara
Sabes mejor que yo que tu movida es escasa
Tu saca tus armas, pasea tu cara como si nada
Yo me esconderé y realmente no quieres que salga
Tu no eres un real gato, eres más una real 'bufarra'
Que se escondía tras profesores en aulas, tú achanta
Crees que se ha ido Jesús y traiciona a sus espaldas
Estás destinado al karma
Al más profundo de los traumas
Estás jodido por bajar la guardia
No consigues bajar de tu parra
Yo estaré sumergido como mi aura en la cloaca, con mis ratas
Raps en los que dejo el alma y mis entrañas en la garganta
Tú crees que engañas, Yo seré aquel negrata
Que te sacará de entre las sabanas blancas. Buah, buah, ¡Cloaka!
(Puliéndome a tontolabas) (x7), chicos del barrio te como andar
Tú mantén la boca chapada, que estás más guapa
Yo con la rayada, tu movida no es tanta

You don't want death to walk her
Not sayin that -- ain't nuttin could do me
But in the rap game, all secondary to me

If a nigga wanna eat he better never cry battle
Hell yeah, ram the one sell fare elsewhere
Put you and your family on welfare

[Chorus: Canibus]

Ain't thick enough, yo wack niggas ain't slick enough
Ready and willin to face you, death awaits you
The king piece in the chess game, to checkmate you

[Slick Rick]
Ooooooooooh, twist shot bitch, ?? voter ignores ??
Watch toys duck, consider rap's ultimate voicebox
Devour, and addressin dem coward
(How can one man posess so much power?) (x6)
Rhyme tearin through, bash all trifle
The eyes and spare a few assholes lives
This object -- brothers are glued to knob lick
'Scuse me, if I'm bein overly rude to public
The favorite -- make you fall in love, make whoever with
Clever kid, make you do the best steps you ever did
The trick is, managin to kick it
It's no such thing as challenging the Slickest
It's double-or-sure shot, crumble before spot
(I know) Must be humble before God
Ringing, cat must fear king-ing
Party over here, type atmosphere spinning

[Chorus: Canibus]
(Ricky D!) Rip it up, your watery blood
Ain't thick enough, yo wack niggas ain't slick enough
Ready and willin to face you, death awaits you

[Slick Rick]
Ooooooooooh, I toy your cheddar top-netter
You find me a human being, boy or girl bet-ter
It's short son -- nurse and them soundkick bark on
Stop talk, stop worshipin the ground Rick walk on
Bitch play number one bougie
Wish they could give motherfucker some pussy
Seen the face of supreme in tasteness
Never see another human being this greatness
Successful, and the hype is effectful and
Sorry God if bein any type disrespectful and
Hip-hop, assume pop's acquited
Now with tick-tock, you don't stop, hit it!
Command Rick, shower the firmament
Earnin it, tremendous power is permanent
Unless frame interest dame
Let's name who the king piece in the chess game

[05. Ossian - ""Freestyle"" (Exclusivo)]

[Intro: Ossian]
Hey, hey, hey, ¿Qué pasa hermanos?
Mi nombre es Ossian, esto es Tutorial Mixtape
Ambur Laineg y Javato Jones pa tus oídos

[Verso]
Me he levantado por la mañana y vuelta a empezar
Uno tras otro, de carrerilla y sin parar
Noté enseguida, sin flujo mi cerebro a cien
Con este estilo rimamos los que rimamos bien
Esto no va a ser dulce, no te confundas
Son ritos y hierbajos, del Asia profunda
Medidas inexactas en potes de conservas
Hace que en la ciudad, haya monos como en selvas
En bacanales griegas declinando mis palabras
Quizás hinquen el codo o inclinados sobre camas
Igual son demasiao' jóvenes
Nos enseñaron a sumar y a restar, pero no a ser hombres
No dan diplomas por echarle cojones
Tampoco flores ni trofeos por salir con moratones
Mi léxico no es el de un hombre docto
Pero los rappers en la calle propagan las posturas que adopto
Besé sus manos, puse flores en su tumba
Limpié su cuerpo, mecí su cuna
Me preocupa quedarme mudo o sordo
No el estampado del envoltorio, si el albornoz es blanco y rojo
Amamos a las máquinas y no escribimos páginas
Por eso siempre falta la tilde de tus lágrimas
Antes de ver mundo dejarás de ser crisálida
Cada vez que pase el tiempo serás polvo y una lápida
Mi hermano Kase.O en el 2016
Sacará el disco del siglo chicos, ya lo veréis
Es un emérito en el mérito, Mc's irán al médico
Tan solo con que piquen este inédito, doy crédito
Si el hierro derretimos y crepita la madera
Ignorantes y eruditos convencemos de cualquier manera
Mundos escondidos como en túneles de montes andinos
Miles de caminos, quiero que hagas conmigo
Y alejarte de lo amargo, de lo que hace daño
Verás cuando comprendas que no hay uno si no muchos planos
Lucho por mi padre que ha currao' 40 años
Y por su dignidad como humano cuando llegue a anciano...

[06. Jeru The Damaja - Come Clean]

[Verso 1]
You wanna front—what? Jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake-gangster emcees and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp defunct
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive get live catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
(I'm a true master, you can check my credentials) (x4)
'Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
'Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and it's nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Hook sampleado] (x5)
Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!

[Verso 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle

[07. Mellow Man Ace - The Brother With Two Tongues]

[Sho-Hai]
Eyou, eyou, aquí Sho Hai al habla
Rey de cantinas directamente desde el Big Deli
Zaragoza Ciudad, Rap Solo
Mucho amor y admiración para Ambur Laineg y Kase.O
Atiende, escucha y siente. ¡Paz!

[08. Violadores del Verso - Moved El Ano]

[Sho Hai: Estrofa 1]
Nunca ando solo, Violadores a mi espalda
Guardan al Hate, son ángeles sin alas
Siempre nos veras en el bar, así nos llaman
Apodados de borrachos van, Bufank
En la tasca gasto mis jornales
Chavales invierten en alcohol para pasarlo en grande
Yo soy uno de ellos, siempre rulo litracos
Y a demás los cachis son minis, van a dentro y a saco
No busco calidad, no, grandes cantidades, si
Dame elixir, siempre es lo mismo en fin
Somos sosos, no pretendas tener un rato agradable con nosotros
Preferirás mas estar solo, os lo aseguro, muchos desistieron
Y otros tantos que se acercan, espera, tiempo al tiempo
Celebro derrotas con mis copas
Y brindo por mi éxito y el futuro con mi esposa
Pasión por la vida aún me queda
¿que se puede esperar de un ser como yo que no se esmera?
Mi misión es violar versos, todo mi empeño esta puesto en esto
Hago mover anos a cientos, a diestro y siniestro
Somos normales, como todo el mundo
Bueno, tenemos un talento especial, eso seguro
La gente me coloca en podios por mi mierda
Les gusta menear el culo a base de mis letras
Dicen que después de la tempestad viene calma
Pues calma y espera sentado la tromba de mi banda
Rompiendo dichos, rompiendo esquemas
Cambiando leyes, cambiando las reglas
Aquellos que al Hate tocaronle las bolas
Ahora me lloran, pues que se jodan
Nunca ando solo, cabrones
Nunca ando solo, a mis espaldas violadores
Bufones de la corte, memos
Hacéis reír al rey de las cantinas con gracietas de versos
Y es lamentable que MCs de poca monta hablen
Hasta el rebuzno de un burro encuentro mas agradable
De eso que tu tanto careces yo lo tengo
De eso que tu tienes yo no lo quiero ¿pa que?
(Sobrado de estilazo estoy, puedes verlo) (x6)
Y tu no ves mi cielo
Cien por cien hago poner bien
El mejor MC del mundo posiblemente como la Carlsberg
Sobredosis de buen rap inyecto por mis venas
Como yonquis en el Ebro en su ribera espera
Bufank que engancha, soy jeringo y pincho
Tienes bonarro de escuchar al mago y a sus chicos
Tranquilo chaval que es normal y al final
Acabaras siendo un fan de los Bufank
Solo con escuchar el nombre de violadores, MCs corren
Zorras tapan sus chochos y esconden, cojonuda
No hay mejor definición para la mierda esta
Moved el ano y cabeza, esa es mi meta
Se me presenta en escenarios como el rey de las cantinas
El respetable Hate al suelo suelta papillas
Anonadados después del espectáculo
Estas con los grandes dioses en el oráculo

[Estribillo: Sho Hai] (x2)
Nunca ando solo
Nunca ando solo, siempre con mis hombres
Nunca ando solo
Nunca ando solo, a mis espaldas Violadores

Las Huellas de Barro represento tío
Milimetriks

[Verso]
Soy El Aitor y hoy estoy en Rap Solo
Controlo el tutorial que sigues
Con todo el arsenal y no haces na' contra estos pives
Si oyes pero no escuchas, existes y no vives
Miras pero no ves, ¿entonces por qué escribes?
Dime si ves diferencias entre entre esclavos y hombres libres
Son tres; Apréndelas, luego decide
Primera: Un esclavo se creé libre, el libre es al revés se creé esclavo
Es raro pero así es después, claro
La segunda es que unos distinguen
Algo que es imposible de algo que aún no han intentado
Los otros se han quedado bajo su tejado
Ellos han hecho al amo y no al revés
Yo y el sutecho es, yo el sujeto de este suceso pues
Te confieso que no sé cual es la número tres
¡Yo! Lo que sí que sé eso es un buen flow
MC's pedís un S.O.S y digo Let's go!
Eyou, Kase.O, Rumba y yo
El retorno del boom bap, rap para tu cuello
Rapper no me ladres, a ti te copian los chiquillos
Y yo ya era imitado por sus padres...

[10. Violadores del Verso - Prestigio Intocable]

[Lírico: Estribillo] (x2)
¿De dónde sale este tipo?
¿Dónde se mete este tipo
¿Quién es este tipo?
Intocable, intocable
Dale prestigio intocable a este tipo!

[Verso 2]
Mientras principiantes cogen el micrófono con optimismo
Yo sigo siendo el mismo, yo sigo siendo el mismo
Serio, puliendo mi prosa
Y asumiendo comentarios que sólo corresponden a diosas
Porque nadie conoce a Lírico, sin palabras
De admiración detrás, resulta ser obsesión
Por Lírico en el microfón
Manejo sexxxy, en el sexo, al son de un saxofón
Sólo trato de vender mi casette
(Todo un símbolo en el rap después discute mi caché) (x6)
Un tipo de carne y hueso qué tiene de increíble
Bajo sospecha tienes mi sonrisa inconfundible
Me mantengo en forma, guerras con el diablo
No más, sólo formas, de obtener diplomas
Personal e intransferible mi movida porque
Tengo mi polla, acá en la retaguardia mi prole
No encajo críticas, ya que sé de batallas
Sé de victorias, estadísticas demuestran
Soy musa de misses, soy culpable de tus días grises
Sólo astros provocan eclipses
Cuando el fin del milenio estar próximo
Yo salí de lo anónimo, sin pisar prójimo
Sólo intocables andan de forma épica
Sólo algo complicado es comparable a mi métrica
Mi vida es acción, devaneos, y en parábolas De Biblias
Trato mantener suspense
Sólo llevo mi arrogancia al extremo
Yo supremo, tu pillas mi flow como demo
No me adapto a moldes, sólo robo protagonismo y fama
Ya de crío planeaba golpes
Intocable, Intocable
R de Rumba en el corte

[Estribillo] (x2)
¿De dónde sale este tipo?
¿Dónde se mete este tipo
¿Quién es este tipo?
Intocable, intocable
¡Dale prestigio intocable a este tipo!

[11. Run D.M.C - Here We Go - Live At The Funhouse]

[Run-D.M.C.]
Here we go.. here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we here we here we go
D.M.C. and DJ Run, dum diddy-dum diddy-diddy-dum-dum
We're rockin on the mic and then you know where we're from
Dum diddy-dum diddy-diddy-dum-dum
We hope y'all ready for the big beat drum
Drum diddy-drum diddy-diddy-drum-drum
So people in the place here the big beat come
Here it come, here it come, here it kiddi-come-come
Come on everybody let's all get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So nobody out there be misled
We make up all these rhymes inside our head
The other MC's cannot compete
When we rap on the mic to this big beat
The beat is big it's kind of large
And when we're on the mic, WE'RE IN CHARGE!

[Run]
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that-a-tha-that, a-like that y'all (that y'all)
Cool chief rocker, I don't drink vodka
But keep a bag of cheeba inside my locker (HUH!)
Go to school everyday (HUH!)
Always time to get paid (HA HUH!)
Cause I'm rockin on the mic until the break of day

[D.M.C.]
And now the things I do make me a star
And you can be too if know who you are
Just put your mind to it, you'll go real far
And the next thing you know you'll have a big car

[Run - overlaps]
A-liggy liggy liggy liggy liggy
Listen to the beat, here I say
Because it's not routine, it's the way I play (Hahh-AHH)
Spit come out my mouth all time of the day; a then ahh
And most the time, Jam Master Jay

[D.M.C.]
Hey they used to call me Easy Dee
Because I rapped on the mic so easily
But now they call me D.M.C
(HE'S) D.M.C. of the par-ty
The D's for doin it all of the time
M is for the rhymes, that are all mine
C's for cool cool as can be
(And why you wear those glasses?) So I can see!

[Run]
Rhymes so def, rhymes rhymes galore
Rhymes that you've never even heard before
Now if you say you heard my rhyme, we gonna have to fight
Cause I just made the motherfuckers up last night
Kick off your shoes, relax your feet
Party on down to the DJ Run beat
The beat to get you up and get you outta your seat
Make you boogie to this (party) cause you know it's unique
Wait a tiny minute, don't break on me
My rhymes come faster as the DJ Cheese
The DJ cuts the record for the valley below
Then I boogie your ass, til it's time to go
And when it's time to go GIRLS, takin you home
So straighten your dress up, bout your hair use a comb

[D.M.C.]
Well I'm the (microphone master, super rhyme maker) (x4)

[Hermano L]
Eyou, esto de aquí es el Hermano L desde esa Puta OPP, Raggaflá, Cuñaos del Fonk, mandandola para Ambur Laineg y Javato Jones, ¿okey?
Tutorial es el nombre de esta mixtape, you must listen
Porque este es el sonido que es rey ¡esta es la puta ley!

[Intro: Hermano L]
Pasate el micrófono 2, Dave...
¡Porque esto no se pue parar!

[Verso 1: Hermano L]
El show de esta noche pue ser la bomba
Aquí en el micro están los que más rezumban
Kase, Dave Bee, Dobleache y Domba
Están sudando aquí para ponerte en forma
Ya sabes, local del 16 en mi norma
Yo soy el rey de la fonky conga
En un retrete encontrarás poco que aprovechar
Pero mi mierda mueve al público de este y aquel lugar
Pilla tu microonda y hazlo con frecuencia
Frank T sigue siendo negro y no es solo apariencia
Esta no engaña y la OPP es la caña de España
Así que limpia tus legañas
Yo me lo monto en el asto
Sueno en tu compacto
Tengo a buena vista, buen tasto
Es pincho como un gasto
Te lo he dicho jamás de retracto
Mi artefacto te salva del infarto

[Dobleache Puente]
¿quién tiene el micrófono?
¿quién me va a dar el micrófono?

[Verso 2: Dobleache]
Ya era hora de que me pasarais el micrófono
Hice un hueco en mi agenda
Isleños de postín con la Abenia en mi pre-venda
Traigo a la orden del ida el desorden de la noche
La mejor babachadara gris de bibaboche
Y oliendo así gusto de pocos, cosas de locos
Prestidigitador del lenguaje con estos otros
Moscas ya conocen la salida de su frasco
Tú busca comparar repara y vigila el gasto
Colgado así de los pulgares
Viejas estampas familiares
Carambola que no harás en tus billares
Esta vez no estimularé vesículas biliares
Son Los Cuñaos del Fonk
Anfitriones estelares y es que:
¡Mallorca es fonky!, ¡Muy fonky!
Que lo sepan de Gomera a Donosti
Es trabajo de campo dejar el listón hoy arriba
Conjurando caras largas, ¿quién derrocha más saliva?
Es coser y cantar, puntadas con hilo como acostumbra
Este arco-iris del color de la penumbra
Sigue echándome de comer aparte
Que de eso se trata
Otro pastel, otra guinda, cosas de una vida en plata

Co, pásate el micrófono, vengo a tope con O Doble P
Jódete, antes de que Kase haga check
Dí que sí, como no, pasale el micrófono
(Al rey del estilo tiene nombre: Kase.O) (x4)
Voy pa allá, ¿puedes competir o mejor callar?
Tú, quieres mi elixir, yo te lo voy a dar
Ven, quién, trajo rimas al micro, suave
Como el mar se lo hizo a la orilla... ¡ya tu sabes co!
Mi estilo es vacilón, no facilón, es mi filón
Que haces ahí jilon, pon más Don Simon
En la isla, aislado, atmósfera
¿Es mi funeral? Ya se verá
Pero hoy mi estilo es libre
Libre como el viento y el verano
Yo gano, chano, ¿ah, no? No jodamos
Doble V, La Vida Verde
La mierda, de este lao' del rio al otro lao' del mar se pierde...

[Keith Murray]
Yo, hey yo, I step out the shell like a black pearl
Become the destroyer of all worlds
I eat you inside out like stress
The best, I never lose a rhyme contest
While troublesome black rolls flows
Bleed internal external like a bloody nose
Props grow like crops
Desert boot Clarks wit no socks
Parking space killer stay out my lot
You hear my voice, you see my face, you know my name
I take it out your ass and charge it to the game
I battle with words, go to war with ideas
You defeat me never in a million years
The factor of the rapture
Is that you either get killed, wound, or captured
They shoot you up so bad til the end you fought
But then you got caught up in my final thought
Nigga

Miss Thing, there is no guest list tonight (sample)

[Redman]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
I get on the mic like badoobedut kick roundhouse
You the tightest motha fucka let me find out
When I pull mines out
I could gaffle Mr. Keebler for all his Chips Ahoy out the chalk Town House
Give you static like your mixer got the ground out
Hug you wit my hands in your grandmas pouch
Im down south wit Outkast wit pounds out
Wicked enough to throw the gun in James Bond mouth
You know E and Keith when we brawl
I be in more hoods than that big fork and spoon on your kitchen wall
And overall, on yall a protocal
My style is Kabal, finish him
For the Benjamins
Fools call me the Grinch
Cause I punch you in your face Christmas on two fifth
While the cops watch the Jamaican hide pot
When I stomp I leave the shoe size of Sasquatch

Miss Thing, there is no guest list tonight (sample)

[Erick Sermon]
Yo, yo
Its E the assassin Antonio Banderas
Catch a few of my enemies by the bodegas
So face it, some of yall should go back to basics
Before the prom, before Sissy Spacik
Reevaluate whats right for you
From the start or was it something you wanted to do fucker
I dig a hole so deep you can't return
And hear about the episode on Howard Stern
Im born wit heart I blast ya
Hit ya wit the fishing deep water and take your yacht master
Playing me one time thats unforgivin
I got a body one count and we ain't bullshittin
We be thick in the mix, milk wit Quik
In the business I work every circuit
(Im bigger, better, and deafer
So however, wherever, whenever, heffer) (x4)

Let's get up, let's get down

Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin' Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station
For a whole new relation-
Ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block

Let them know your logo, not a black thing

Sé que esperáis buenas rimotas
Yo siento vuestro hambre como el mío
Más no os queráis meter en las botas

Mediante astro-lenguaje, ese es mi extraño bagaje
No puedes subir mis notas
Soy un maestro, dejo el texto lleno de derrotas
Voy con lo puesto pues me atrae mucho el lujo idiotas
Suelen cambiar su rap por un flujo promesas rotas y mal caviar
Mientras sueltas esas rimas flojas, ¿de qué te quejas?
¿Te has parado a revisar tus hojas? ¿Lo que reflejas?
Lo que pienso yo es que estás perdido, estás jodido
No has medido en que te has metido en tremendo lío

Be my woman tonight
Just ain't feelin' right
Be my woman tonight
Just ain't feelin' right

[Slug]
Hey lady, I don't mean to be so forward
But I got no other choice, soon I'll be across the border
Tourmode, I'm leavin' in the AM
But I wanna spend this evening breathing in ya fragrance
Too long since I've seen my better half
Sometimes you gotta let go, close your eyes and let it crash
Road to life is the only one I have to give
Lonely isn't a strong enough adjective
To describe all those nights that I've tried to grip tight
I lack the necessary tools to help me get right
So take your place as the temporary savior
While I'm looking at your face like I'll be tested on it later
I bet you like to fuck, but you love to argue
Poke a hole into my chest and pull my heart through
Up to my room for cigarettes and cartoons
Or we could sit right here and try to guard these barstools
I'll take you anyway that I can have you
Bring along your ethics and your issues and your taboos
It's not the standard ""Free Bird' situation
But you're talking to these pieces of a man whose trying to make it
Through the puzzles, travels, struggles, battles
The body pillow pimp trying to snuggle with my shadow
We could stay proper keep the clothes on, no pressure
Just hold me and pretend like you've known me forever
Won't ya..

[Hook:]
Be my woman tonight
Just ain't feelin' right
Be my woman tonight
Just ain't feelin' right

[Murs]
Damn, why'd she have to leave right after the show
All that eye contact made from the front row
Them vibes I was getting man I thought it was a go
Could used that type of company, you just don't know
I been on the road for like six months straight
Only two days off between all of them dates
The hardest working man in the underground game
Most times I'm too tired to hang around and spit game
Most nights are the same, shows is just like work
Leave the stage, stand around, selling merchs and shirts
Then I peeked her pink skirt out the corner of my eye
By the exit posted up like a tack, looking fly
I tried to play it cool, but I coudn't pretend
So I approached hella anxious with a silly ass grin
She said she dropped off her friends, so we could be alone
Gave her undivided attention, turned off her phone
Took me out for pancakes, paid for the dinner
Then took me to my room, let me watch sports center
And then we made out, and then we made love
And then I passed out while I got a backrub
But in the middle of the night I reached for a second helpin'
Got a hand full of sheets, I was all by myself an'
Before you could say: 'Goddamn that sucks'
JayBird called: ""cats, van, bags” … FUCK!

Vuela mi palama blanca

Pero tu no me dejaste
Voy a cambiar el dolor

Que me enseñaste

Pude averme equivocado
Pero nunca fue pa' tanto

Voy a salir a buscarte

49,50 Ways To Leave Your Lover,"(Sha-Smoove)
I told her hop on the bus Gus
From the first time i met you should've know you were no one i could trust
But i took my chances just so i could test my waters
That wasn't smart figured you hold my heart
Take it with you on Noah's ark
But nah no part of me was even on that boat
You just told me what i wanted to hear like a horoscope
Father broke, blew his cash on liquor made from artichokes
Surprised her background cleaner then a bar of soap
You convinced me to do certain things that i wouldn't do
Felt guilty so convinced myself just to do it for you
But i shouldn't let my past interfere with the future
Turned my heart into stone staring at Medusa
Hit your fanny from the got her telling me go deeper
She only said that she was influenced by the reefer
We could hit the shopping mall just to show niggas we was styling
Then we hit the Jamaican islands

Imma' slip out the back jack like an ass crack
I'm mad that her love was so hazmat
Poison avoiding the problems
Toying its obvious
She only wanted me for the objects
Honest, i really thought i liked you
Thought i was going to wife you
Felt bad parents were junkies dropped out of high school
Tried to assist with the green like Rondo
But i know i was getting played like a high note
Started getting bold with some back talk
You wasn't from the streets but i guess its that ass fault
I was blinded , mindless i thought we were timeless
Yea looks could kill but so did my kindness
Killed our relationship
We started faking shit
She said to me i don't think we can make it rich
Thought to myself and i sadly agreed
And I'll never forget what she said to me
She said

There's more than 50 ways you could leave the one that you truly love

56,Slow Ride,"[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys]

They got a committee to get me off the block
Cause I say my rhymes loud and I say 'em nonstop
Because being bad news is what we're all about
We went to White Castle and we got thrown out

I got my boy Mike D. - I got the King Adrock
I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud

Slow riding, gun hidin', on the go
I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow
I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back
My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack

She chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand, at the microphone stand
Ay, yo, homeboy - what you drinkin', man?

I got money - I got juice
I got to the party and I got loose
I got rhythms - I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the def behinds
I got ill - I got busted
I got dust and I got dusted
I got gold - I got funky
I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey

Because I'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell
I got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
Sittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube
Eating Colonel's chicken - drinkin' Heineken brew
I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster - I'm the king of the ave
I'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have
All the fine ladies are making a fuss
But I can't pay attention - cause I'm on that dust",Beastie Boys,1975,"[57, 67, 77]",3
57,The Blind Man In The Bleachers,"He's just the blind man in the bleachers
To the local home town fans
And he sits beneath the speakers
Way back in the stands
And he listens to the play by play
He's just waiting for one name
He wants to hear his son get in the game

But the boy's not just a hero
He's strictly second team
Tho he runs each night for touchdowns
In his father's sweetest dreams
He's gonna be a star some day
Tho you might never tell
But the blind man in the bleachers knows he will

And the last game of the season is a Friday night at home
And no one knows the reason but the blind man didn't come
And his boy looks kinda nervous
Sometimes turns around and stares
Just as tho' he sees the old man sittin' there

The local boys are tryin' but they slowly lose their will
Another player's down and now
He's carried from the field
At halftime in the locker room
The kid goes off alone
And no one sees him talkin' on the phone

The game's already started
When he gets back to the team
And half the crowd can hear his coach yell
""Where the hell you been?""
""Just gettin' ready for the second half,""
Is all he'll say
""Cause now you're gonna let me in to play.""

Without another word, he turns and runs into the game
And through the silence on the field
Loudspeakers call his name
It'll make the local papers
How the team came from behind
When they saw him playin' his heart to win

And when the game was over
The coach asked him to tell
What was it he was thinkin' of
That made him play so well
""You knew my dad was blind,"" he said
""Tonight he passed away""
""It's the first time that my father's seen me play""",David Geddes,1975,"[58, 61, 71, 86]",4

61,Take It To The Limit,"[Verse 1]
All alone at the end of the evening and the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking about a woman who might have loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer spent my life running round
And it's so hard to change can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out and turning out the same

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time

[Verse 2]
You can spend all your time making money you can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine
And when you're looking for more freedom when nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door well you can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back you're running back
You're coming back for more

So put me on a highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time",Waylon Jennings & Willie Nelson,1975,"[62, 80]",2

The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray, It's Christmas for cowboys, wide-open plains

Lost without my other half
How can I live without ya?
I don't want another
That's why I'm messed up about ya
Can't even dream without seein' you
Why should I even try to breathe? (Breathe)

Thought we'd never be divided

Won't you please find me?

And if you want I'll take you there

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

With my love
Our love will seal it together
Oh, with our love
You made a promise
You'll always love me forever

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love",Bee Gees,1975,[73],1
72,The Homecoming,"[Verse 1]
We are a living absolute
Stuck in an anguished innocence
This moment loved
I greet the sun
And wake from a war i could have won
Well in your arms I'll keep this memory to me
This kitchen floor won't reveal all the things I felt for you

[Chorus]
Please level with me
Understand, I'd do anything for you
Seize any moment while you can
This void's coming after you
Cause loneliness is why you hurt
Just don't kill the messenger

[Verse 2]
The dust a-dance against my breath
The world awaken slowly dressed
A life unanswered in the light
With questions scattered in the night
And now my heart feels heavy
The weight will drag me down
You were the only reason
They'd find me here tonight

[Chorus]
Please level with me
Understand, I'd do anything for you
Seize any moment while you can
This void's coming after you
Cause loneliness is why you hurt
Just don't kill the messenger


Please level with me
Understand, I'd do anything for you
Seize any moment while you can
This void's coming after you
Cause loneliness is why you hurt
Loneliness is why you hurt

Please level with me
Understand, I'd do, I'd do anything for you
Seize any moment while you can
This void's coming after you
Cause loneliness is why you hurt
Just don't kill the messenger",Coheed and Cambria,1975,"[74, 86]",2
73,How High The Moon,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
And love is far away too
Until it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
That's where you are

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, I'll still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, I'll still my heart
How high the moon

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, I'll still my heart
How high the moon",Emmylou Harris,1975,"[75, 77, 83, 88, 93]",5

Drake, Rick Ross, & Lil Wayne ""No New Friends""“No New Friends” was the first single off DJ Khaled's Suffering From Success album. Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib, the track features the usual suspects: Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne. A behind-the-scenes photo from this song's video shoot led to the ultra-famous ‘Drake Lean’ meme, one of the biggest memes of 2013! With an enthralling beat and a memorable hook, “No New Friends” was one of the most anthemic tracks of the year.84. Danny Brown ft. A$AP Rocky ""Kush Coma""83. Rick Ross ft. Future ""No Games""

72. Tech N9ne ft. Serj Tankian ""Straight Out The Gate""71. ASAP Nast ft. Method Man ""Trillmatic""70. Kid Cudi ""Immortal""In an extremely personal ”Immortal”, Cudi details his inner struggles. Arguably the best song from Indicud, this track saw Cudi handle all duties, production included. The drums hit hard, the harmonizing is uplifting and the strings melt your ears. Even an Adam Sandler sample made its way into the joint!

66. TI ft. B.o.B & Kendrick Lamar ""Memories Back Then""65. Mac Miller ft. Schoolboy Q ""Gees""This playful track is about nothing at all, so who better to kill it than Q and Mac? Mac lays down a characteristically hilarious hook and switches flows and voices as the bouncy beat from Chuck Inglish changes up. Q does his high-energy Q thing and blesses us with a nice ""FIGG SIDEEEEEEEE"" to wrap it all up.64. Lil B ""I Love You""63. Danny Brown ft. Purity Ring ""25 Bucks""62. Schoolboy Q ""Yay Yay""61. Wale ft. Tiara Thomas ""Bad""60. Lupe Fiasco ""SLR 2""
The fan requested “Control” response brought out Super Lupe for the second time and he was none too happy with the game. He called out multiple rappers while seamlessly changing flows and displaying classic Lupe lyricism. Oh yeah, and he made the song in just two hours!59. Mac Miller ""Objects In The Mirror""58. Earl Sweatshirt ft. Tyler, the Creator ""Whoa""57. Childish Gambino ft. Chance the Rapper ""Worst Guys""56. 2 Chainz ft. Pharrell ""Feds Watching""55. Rich Homie Quan ""Type Of Way""
One hit wonder or talented hit maker? That’s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem “Type of Way"". The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet - even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem!54. Vic Mensa ""Orange Soda""53. Ace Hood ""Bugatti"" ft. Future & Rick Ross52. Run The Jewels ""Banana Clipper""51. YG ""My Nigga""50. Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bap-esque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from “Summer Knights”, Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free!49. Rocko “U.O.E.N.O (Black Hippy Remix)” ft. Ab Soul, Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar & Schoolboy Q48. Tyler, the Creator “Answer”47. Joey Badass “'95 'Till Infinity”46. Hopsin “Hop Is Back”45. Isaiah Rashad “Shot U Down (Remix)” ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q”
TDE newcomer Isaiah Rashad’s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original “I Shot U Down”. Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q, the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by, we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”
43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY! 42. Mac Miller “Red Dot Music” ft. Action Bronson41. Jay Z “Oceans” ft. Frank Ocean40. J Cole “Forbidden Fruit” ft. Kendrick LamarAnother collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Cole's album ""Born Sinner"". While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it, the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses, talking about religion, his inner struggle, and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole!39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft. Rick Ross38. Schoolboy Q “Man Of The Year”37. Earl Sweatshirt “Sunday” ft. Frank Ocean36. Jay Z “FuckwithmeyouknowIgotit” ft. Rick Ross35. Tyler, the Creator “IFHY” ft. Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars, this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. Oh, and there’s THAT VIDEO! The talk-rap, slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge, with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout, and then he made that video and this became undeniably next-level. 34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z
31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave (Oakland)”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album, this is a dark, entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave, we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again, or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song, Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler, the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg “Work (Remix)” ft. A$AP Rocky, French Montana, SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James
26. Pusha T “King Push” 25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap, Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s sing-songy, cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to (some jumping around is mandatory). But listen closely, and you get Chancelor’s dope bars: dense, great-sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though, you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you’re left with is one of the catchiest, most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake “Hold On We're Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”21. Eminem “Berzerk""20. Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same stand-out combines Drizzy’s loud, arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty, bass-heavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS, Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song -- he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots, Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST!”19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris' standout track, “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark, Odd Future feel, Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies, the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl? That's up for debate, but you can't deny that Shyne, and everyone else on the song, absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed, Love Game was one of the most heavily-anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade-level back-and-forth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as left-field as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin-produced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s (cheesy sample included), Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail, while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song, Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes, with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women, Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love!
17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”
“Started From The Bottom”, produced by Mike Zombie, was the first single off Drake's Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’, but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year, there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino, but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how, if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you, you can be completely alone in a crowded room, to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.
15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hip-hop converge on this mixtape cut, with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and re-introducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse, and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him, restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing-songy verse; Twista, on the other hand, is not quite so willing to take a back seat, successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double-time bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio, the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hip-hop is once again Chicagoan.
14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world, Jay Z's boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new album's leadoff track is not Hov, but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation, so that we are well-primed for the rapper's entry.And what an entry it is. His daughter's name is literally the first word out of his mouth, and with good reason. A post-fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame, while admitting ultimately that he can't leave it alone. And lest we think he's lost a step, his patented wordplay is in full effect, with a pun on ""pigeons"" that puts today's coke-rappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.
""1 Train"" is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line-up without a single weak spitter, and they all did their worst to this Hit-Boy produced banger. It's impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: was it the energized Danny Brown? the lovable braggart Action Bronson? the wordsmith Joey Bad? the hard-driving Big K.R.I.T.? Someone else? I can't decide, but I do know this: the track is flames

12. Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainment's main artists, Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things, (and how other people can't have them), before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random, but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album, it was fair to assume it would result in a genre-blending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres, but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals, we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. Kanye is pissed off, but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No, Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song, which represents the rebellious, IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop, Kanye crafts an uneasy, raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion, nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook, but otherwise it is Cole’s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl, but also hip-hop and its impact on him - giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds, its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013, fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page!09. Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi-1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses, Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal, looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same

08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”
My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover, “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back”, and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. “Kanye West - Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson
“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes? Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity? Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future? Who really cares? Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples, topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like?! Well, many would actually say “the video”, which was an overtly cheesy, green-screened, steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe, but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very, New Slaves of him.06. Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to much-loved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back, there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow-up to his epic 2000 story-song “Stan,” fans were nervous.  After all, Stan died at the end, right? So what’s left?Plenty, as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap), now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex, the song switches perspective, revealing an intense look at Eminem’s self-doubts and anguish. Just before the end, he drops the biggest gem of all: his in-song tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”  The rapper himself may not know, but trust us, Slim, we do.05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing, Kendrick is in the midst of consumption - the contrast is phenomenal, both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare, the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night, 4 shots of espresso every morning, and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It’s dope. 04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”
Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus: remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels, it’s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample, but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre-album release, but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns, explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song, like Kanye originally planned? The world would have imploded.03. Eminem “Rap God”
”Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on”. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off, Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapid-fire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP, sneak disses to some of his old buddies, and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day ""Rap God"" was released, and has now amassed over 4 million page views

Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television, Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It’s safe to say ""Rap God"" proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him.02. Big Sean “Control” ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a baby's first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather, he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons, we'll skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion, while sneaking in TV and car references, and even mentioning his late grandmother, much like Sean did.
However, there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name? King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pac's offspring and the King of New York, causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no, it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MC's of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper - by their name, a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!). Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it?
01. Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank Ocean
""New Slaves"" is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people - made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew, New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro, providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song, acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry, and even America's prison system, it’s hard to disagree

The Chi-town native doesn’t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup, Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day, the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically - would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first? His movement, spearheaded with this peoples anthem, was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe, Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the Matrix
Just as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion, sometimes you have to blow up the building.— Kanye West",Rap Genius,1975,"[76, 81, 85, 89]",4

76,Almost Saturday Night,"Outside my window, I can hear the radio
And I know that motor wagon is ready to fly
'Cause it's almost Saturday night

Bye bye, tomorrow, Jody's gone to the rodeo
And you know some good ol' boys are ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push the clouds away, let the music have its way
Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm a-goin'

Outside, they're ringing, the night train is bringin' me home
When you hear that locomotion, get ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push the clouds away, let the music have it's way
Let it steal my heart away, and you know I'm a-goin'

Outside, they're ringing, the night train is bringin' me home

77,For A Dancer,"Keep a fire burning in your eye
Pay attention to the open sky
You never know what will be coming down
I don't remember losing track of you
You were always dancing in and out of view
I must have thought you'd always be around
Always keeping things real by playing the clown
Now you're nowhere to be found
I don't know what happens when people die
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try
It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear
That I can't sing
I can't help listening
And I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round
Crying as they ease you down
'cause I know that you'd rather we were dancing
Dancing our sorrow away
(right on dancing)
No matter what fate chooses to play
(there's nothing you can do about it anyway)
Just do the steps that you've been shown
By everyone you've ever known
Until the dance becomes your very own
No matter how close to yours
Another's steps have grown
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone
Keep a fire for the human race
Let your prayers go drifting into space
You never know what will be coming down
Perhaps a better world is drawing near
And just as easily it could all disappear
Along with whatever meaning you might have found
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around
(the world keeps turning around and around)
Go on and make a joyful sound
Into a dancer you have grown
From a seed somebody else has thrown
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own
And somewhere between the time you arrive
And the time you go
May lie a reason you were alive
But you'll never know",Katey Sagal,1975,"[79, 89, 95, 99, 100]",5
78,Yesterday's Hero,"When I walk down the streets
See the people who stop and stare and say
Haven't I seen that face somewhere a long time ago
When I walk down the streets
See the stranger who says 'why, hi'
With a 'how you goin', buddy'
When you walked on by I thought I'd say hallo

They say: haven't I seen your face before
Weren't you the boy that used to live next door
Weren't you on television every night
Haven't I seen you round

Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, that's all I'll be
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
And yesterday's hero is all that I'm gonna be if I don't get together
Make a new start and be somebody better
All that I'll be if I don't get together now

When you walk down the streets
If you know me, then pass me by
If you wonder what I'm doing
Don't ask me why I don't read the news
When you walk down the streets
If you're sorry then don't feel bad
If you followed my story
Then just be glad you ain't in my shoes

Because haven't you seen my face before
Yes, I was the boy who used to live next door
Yes, I was on television every night
Haven't you seen me round

Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, that's all I'll be
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
And yesterday's hero is all that I'm gonna be if I don't get together
Make a new start and be somebody better
All that I'll be if I don't get together now

79,Break Away,"[Verse 1: Nines]
Sorry mom for all them times I got suspended in school
Gettin' footballer money, my teacher said I was a fool
Haters commenting on my 'Gram, that shit don't faze me
4 pipes on the Porsche, yo my whip so crazy
Told Pebz ""make sure you stay strapped""
I just left the label Christmas party to go and break down a pack
1a the hood, land all them shottas out of town
Went 'Dam for the plug, now we the opposite of down
Tryna leave a nigga's head by the pavement
Drivin' round in this dinger, gettin' impatient
Thinkin' that I shoulda spent more time with my nephew
It's fucked, seen them fake niggas shine seen the best lose
Pissed cuh my little nigga lost a few guns
Me and Pebz out in bail rollin' with some new ones
I get money every time my phone rings
Wasn't always fly, we had to grow wings
I'm still in the field where it's fucking real
I ain't got time to chill
I need a hundred mil
And way before the deal I paid my mother's bills
Tryna cop a house in the hills
That's how uncle Phil
Free my nigga Hydro, he just rang
When I sweep my floor
I'm finding bitches' earrings in my dust pan
Told my Misses that she can't fucking be my wife
Cuh I'm way too ambitious, you do nothin' with your life
Came a long way from 7 grams on the scale
Feels like yesterday I was banged up in jail
Now it's planes all the time, I be traveling the world
Fuck 'Dam, I'm goin' Spain they got ammi there for sale
But now I'm in the office, used to doin' business in the rain
Now it's house parties every week, Sydney and Sharane
Should I fall back off the trap
Put my whole into rap
Niggas keep callin' for packs
And I can't walk away from stacks
Heard he put down his gun and his mask
Tryna live off his rep, who gives a fuck what you done in the past
Got a deal, still tryna make it off the loud
Don't be standin' with them paigons, cuh I spray in the crowd
It's Nines...

[Skit 1: Nines]
These young bucks are fucked B
Like they look up to the drug dealers and shit
All the gang bangers, or footballers
All the footballers can't make it bruh
And they end up flyin' birds
All the Trapstars can't make you think every little nigga gonna be Nina wid da Nina

[Verse 2: Nines]
Ay yo fuck the haters
Talkin' 'bout we're troublemakers
Everybody on me for a hundred favors
Me and Bund bunin' flavours
Ask the neighbours
I was out there, mornin' from the night
Used to say one day I'll be a baller, I was right
All these groupie bitches around the country wanna holla
Yea I fucked the fans, but don't judge me like your honour
Famous in the shooter
I just came from the jeweler
Immigration wanna dip my chain back to Cuba
Did alright last year, probably shoulda saved more
Lookin' through The Sun I see my ting on page 4
I'm gettin' bait, I gotta hide my face
Still got crackheads whistling outside the base
I just stay in my lane, I ain't worried 'bout them broke haters
Probably get about 20 Phillips watch with no papers
Send my yungens shop for a box of latex
He's been gettin' money since So Solid was rockin' Avirexes
It's Nines...

[Skit 2: Nines]
Some of the flyest Trapstars I ever seen in my life
Or most of them, are ridin' bird right now bludLucky I was flyin' birds
But I was sayin' ""Oh lemme try this music ting as well""
Man was payin like...
Obviously I was payin' for all this shit myself
I could honestly say, I don't know how much I faulked into music
Mad Ps probably, I don't know
Little niggas gotta fuckin' invest their P blud
Or try invest into something other than trapping
I mean everyone can't be a rapper blud
Niggas can do many other things
But just invest in suttin' else B
There you have it, your boy a revolutionist ya know

Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night
Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

[Chorus: Frankie Valli]
Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I
As I recall, it ended much too soon

[Verse 2: Gerry Polci]
Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under

Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I

84,I Cheat The Hangman,"The days grow short, the nights are gone
Since you were here, I can't go on
I cried for you, to no avail
Now my life runs cold when the night winds wail
But I cheat the hangman, cheated him many times before
The bell that tolls the hour has turned sweet lips to sour
Yes, I cheat the hangman and even when life has flown away
I leave a kiss behind

The rain that fell upon my stone
Like tears you cry I shared alone
I walk the night, I cannot sleep
The love you spend you cannot reap

The glow of love will then shine

Only lighted windows stare at the lonely stranger there returning home",The Doobie Brothers,1975,[86],1
85,The White Knight,"Down 75 or 85
Or I-20 t'other way
Turn your squelch to the right
And in the night
You'll hear some good buddy say
""Breaker breaker
Got a picture taker
All Smokeys at forty three.""

It's that Japanese toy
The trucker's joy
That everybody calls CB
Yeah, Citizen's Band, keeps you up to date
On fender benders and Tijuana taxis
And all them bears out there. Flip flop

Now ahead of your children and ahead of your wife
On the list of the ten best things in life
Your CB's gotta rate right around number four
'Course beavers and hot biscuits and Merle Haggard
Come one, two, three, you know

Well I was loaded down, coming outta Lake City;
I was checkin' out seat covers, young and pretty
When all of a sudden there come a call
Over my CB, ringin' wall to wall
Said clove her double nickels till you hit the ridge
'Cause there's a Smokey picture taker t'other side of the bridge

""Oh mercy, 'ppreciate that, good buddy;
What's your handle there, come on?
You got any county mounties out there prowlin', come on?""
And he said --

""Ten four...back door
Put the peddle to the metal and...let it roar
Hammer down...to Macon town...
Gonna see my momma...sure
Well, the bears are gone
Let's...bring it on...
The Georgia line's...out of sight
Pulled outta Richmond town last Saturday night
And my handle is...the White Knight
How 'bout it?""

""All right, White Knight, hammer down
You got the mean machine here.""
I was a streakin'
My needle was a peakin'
A right around seventy nine
That old diesel juice
Was a gettin' loose
And everything was fine
But wall to wall
I got a call
Front door, big bear trapper
Said, ""Break one nine
Good buddy of mine
You got a Smokey in a plain white wrapper.""

Well I jammed my stick
I lost twenty quick;
You could hear them gears a tearin'
I got passed by a beaver
And a Camaro
I was cruisin' alone
And going so slow
I could count every button on that frilly blouse she was wearin'

'Course there weren't but one

""Hey there, super trooper!
Yeah -- that's the crafty Smokey over there with a CB of his own
Hey White Knight, let's slide one on the super trooper, come on?""

""Ten four, back door
Put the peddle to the metal, whatcha...waitin' for?
That old flop
Can't stay in sight
Gonna leave you here and say no more
How 'bout it?""

""Whoa, now, buddy, that's fightin' talk
I'd get up there and blow your doors off!""

Well I hammered down like I had wings
Little gravels in my wheels going ping, ping, ping
'Bout the time I hit ninety-two
Saw something flashing' in my rear view
Thought to myself that can't be true
But there it was, old blue, blue, blue

Uh oh. Bubble gum machine done hit the jackpot

Well I could see that bear, laughing big
Hangin' in tight on the back of my rig
Right there and then it came to be wall to wall
Mm-hmm

So in that cold dark Georgia night
In the shadows of Smokey bear's blue light
I 'cided to make me just one more CB call

""Breaker one nine for the super trooper
Hey there, Smokey old buddy, tell me if I'm right
Are you my front door? Are you the White Knight? Come on?""
And he said --

""Ten four, back door
You're in a heap of trouble boy...that's for sure
Gonna read you your rights, and treat you fair
Pull over there
With your...rockin' chair
Want you boys to know each other real well
'Cause you gonna be sharin' the same jail cell
You make twelve cotton pickers I've caught tonight
From the front door of that White Knight
Hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha!!
How 'bout it?
Hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha!!
Forty miles over the speed limit!
You boys gonna be here a spell
Hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha!!
Hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha!!""

That's it, cotton pickers, I've done been grounded;
My tail's in jail, my rig impounded
So when you're comin' through the Georgia night
Don't ever get no front door called the White Knight

No sir. Wind up in the pokey with Smokey
I'm gonna pull that old CB thing out by the wires
I don't care if it is",Aaron Tippin,1975,[87],1

Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you

Then I went over to the house next door
Her teardrops fell like rain that day
When I told Joni what I had to say

Joni, Joni, please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
You're just fifteen I'm twenty-two
And Joni I just can't wait for you

Soon I left our little hometown
Got me a job and tried to settle down
But these words kept haunting my memory
The words that Joni said to me

Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love, forever true

[Verse 6: Conway]
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane
I had to see Joni I had to explain
How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me

[Verse 7: Conway]
I ran all the way to the house next door
But things weren't like they were before
My teardrops fell like rain that day
When I heard what Joni had to say

91,Every Beat Of My Heart,"Through these misty eyes I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country
Heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
But don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour

And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the
Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home",Gladys Knight & the Pips,1975,"[93, 95, 98, 100]",4
92,Amazing Grace (used To Be Her Favorite Song),"Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?
She was all I ever wanted
She was an angel for sure
She stands even now in my memory
So sweet and pure
But all that made me happy
Was a bottle and a song
Used to stay out drinkin'
While she cried all night long
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

She thought she could make me
Change in awhile so she learned
How to drink and she learned how to smile
I guess the pull of the bottle
Was just a little bit to strong
Now she's left me and
I don't know where she's gone
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

And then one night she said ""I'm goin'...""
But she didn't say where
It didn't seem to matter
And I didn't really care
But now that I'm sober
And I can see it all
I know I'm to blame for her fall
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?
Lord where's my good girl gone?",Amazing Rhythm Aces,1975,"[94, 98]",2
93,Make Love To Your Mind,"I love the story in your love song
Buildin' them castles in your mind
You come down here lookin' for a feelin'
Someday I know you're gonna find
I wanna lay down now beside you
But first we ought to take some time
Before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind

I wanna feel good just like you do
I haven't love in quite some time
I have some phases that I've been through
Where I've just loved and left behind
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty
I don't wanna be unkind
But before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind",Bill Withers,1975,"[95, 96]",2
94,Blue Guitar,"I once knew a man
Showed me the sleight of hand
In the blink of an eye he danced across the strings
He played a song I'd never heard
Poignant and absurd
And to this day it leaves me wondering

How I wish tommorrow I were fishin'
Boy I got a mission, to shake it rattle and roll
Oh now just use your intuition
You'll get less competition, from the clock upon the wall

You are what you are
You dream what you dream
Play on your blue guitar for me
Play me serenade
A simple masquerade
Play on your blue guitar for me

Was he real or make-believe
Or someone to deceive
That time is just a folly we can't see
You only know one song
Play it right or play it wrong
'Cause the truth is always somewhere in between

You and I - we can't change the weather
And we're all in this together so let the stong wind blow
Oh now things will be much better
If you don't become a prisoner to the reason you should know

You are what you are
You dream what you dream
Play on your blue guitar for me
Play me a serenade
A lover's masquerade
Play on your blue guitar for me

(let's play it boys)

How I wish tommorrow I were fishin'
Boy Igot a mission, to shake it rattle and roll
Oh now just use your intuition
You'll get less competition, from the clock upon the wall

You are what you are
You dream what you dream
Play on your blue guitar for me
Play me serenade
Red wine and lemonade
Play on your blue guitar for me",Jimmy Buffett,1975,"[96, 97, 99]",3

What that man holding in his hand?
He looks a lot like a guy I knew way back when
It's silly willy with the Philly band

Behind the stacks you glimpse an axe
The tension mounts you score an ounce, Ole!
Temperatures rise as you see the whites of their eyes

If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw

You've got Rock and Roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there.... Oh yeah....

In my green metal suit I'm preparing to shoot up the City
And the ring at the end of my nose makes me look rather pretty
It's a pity there's nobody here to witness the end
Save for my dear old friend and confidante - Madamoiselle Kitty

What's the man movin' to and fro?
That decibel meter doesn't seem to be reading low
But they was louder at the Rainbow
Could be..... Oo - ee

That time you told me that
You were going to be marrying soon
And jet, I thought the only
Lonely place was on the moon

How come he told you that
You were hardly old enough yet?
And jet, I thought the major
Was a lady suffragette

Ah, matter, want jet to always love me?

97,I Believe In Father Christmas,"They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the Virgin's Birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winter's light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
And they told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked at the Sky with excited eyes
'till I woke with a yawn in the first Light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise

I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish and pain and sadness
Leave your Heart and let your road be clear
They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah, Noel, be it Heaven or hell
The Christmas you get you deserve

They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth",Tony Hadley,1975,"[99, 99]",2
98,Breakfast For Two,"An air of self delusion that no two arms could ever contain
This lady is a hypnosis poet and when she speaks her words weep like rain
She tiptoes through the side streets in the morning and wears dark sunshades at night
However she might be spending her time I don't know you'd have to ask her neighbors

But she ain't ever gonna open up (no)
She ain't ever gonna open up (no)
Not to no one
My dear ramona

Born in some unnatural state that no one father would claim
This daughter saving up commissions from acting but no one's ever seen her play
She fixes breakfast for two in the morning and drinks dark coffee at night
Whoever she might be going to bed with, you can read about that in her Moleskine

But she ain't ever gonna open up (no)
She ain't ever gonna open up (no)

They see you as small and helpless;
They see you as just a child

Prepare for your finest hour
The dream that you've always dreamed is suddenly about to flower
We are lightning
Straying from the thunder
Miracles of ancient wonder

This will be the day we've waited for
This will be the day we open up the door
I don't wanna hear your absolution;
Hope you're ready for a revolution
Welcome to a world of new solutions
Welcome to a world of bloody evolution
In time, your heart will open minds
A story will be told
And victory is in a simple soul

[Verse 2]
Your world needs a great defender
Your world's in the way of harm
You want a romantic life; a fairytale that's full of charm
Beware that the light is fading;
Beware as the dark returns
This world's unforgiving, even brilliant lights will cease to burn
Legends scatter
Day and night will sever
Hope and peace are lost forever

Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
But I've seen miracles in every way
[S2D] And I see miracles every day
Oceans spanning beyond my sight
[VJ] And a million stars way above 'em at night
We don't have to be high to look in the sky
And know that's a miracle opened wide
[S2D] Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
[VJ] And everything chilling underwater, please!
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
[S2D] Long neck giraffes, pet cats and dogs
[VJ] And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
All in one room, together as equal
[S2D] Pure magic is the birth of my kids
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
[VJ] The sun and the moon, and even Mars
[S2D] The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
[VJ] UFOs
[S2D] a river flows
[VJ] Plant a little seed and nature grows
[S2D] Niagara Falls and the pyramids
[VJ] Everything you believed in as kids
[S2D] Fucking rainbows, after it rains
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
[VJ] I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco Bay
It tried to eat my cell phone, [S2D] he ran away

And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling
[S2D] I see miracles all around me
Stop and look around, it's all astounding

[S2D] Fucking magnets, how do they work?
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
[VJ] Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
[S2D] Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
[VJ] And I love my mom, for giving me this
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
[S2D] Miracles ain't nothing to lie
[VJ] Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
And my little boy looks just like daddy
[S2D] Miracles each and everywhere you look
And nobody has to stay where they put
This world is yours, for you to explore
[VJ] It's nothing but miracles beyond your door
The Dark Carnival is your invitation
[S2D] To witness that without explanation
[VJ] Take a look at this fine creation
[S2D] And enjoy it better with appreciation
[VJ] Crows, ghosts, [S2D] the midnight coast
[VJ] The wonders of the world, [S2D] mysteries the most
[VJ] Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
[S2D] To ignore the miracles of every day
[VJ] And that's real

I came all the way from England! Where's me bloody 'undred thousand pounds?
What I wanna know is where in hell is my goddamn hundred thousand dollars?
And where can I get some beer in this motherfucker?
I thought this was a carnival. Where's all the sexy kids at? Don't tell me I brought all this candy for nothing!
I didn't come all this way to stand around here with all these goddamn tadpoles! Let's get a move on!

You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't

Just don't

110,Lyin' Eyes,"[Verse 1]
City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man
And she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is
Only given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She is headed for the cheating side of town

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

[Verse 2]
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms
They fall together
She whispers that it's only for awhile
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

[Verse 3]
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lying eyes",Eagles,1975,"[53, 39, 39, 12, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 10, 18, 40, 54, 79]",14
111,I'm Sorry,"[Verse 1]
Go ahead and call me a coward
Say that I'm not strong because I'm not like you
Go ahead and call me crazy
'Cause I live in a maze, tell me how about you?
I think I live in my head
Sometimes I think that I'm dead, I hide behind my youth
Know I been losing my mind
And I'm a little behind, step inside my shoes
'Cause I've never been happy with myself
And I don't need no one feeling bad for me
Tryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
Behind closed doors, just close the door
Let me be by myself—just me and myself
I'm tired of living, I cry
I hear it's easy to die, I wanna see for myself
And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else
But I'm depressed as fuck, stressed as fuck
Ain't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs
I mean, I need extra love
And that ain't even enough, said that ain't even enough
And where the fuck is God? (God, God)
Damn, maybe I ain't believing enough
But today we gonna see if he's real
And if He is, then I guess I'm prolly going to hell
Look, I ain't wanna die like this
I ain't picture my life like this
They don't know what it's like like this
Pretending I'm happy so I can smile like this, and laugh like you
Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you
Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like, ""Woo!""
Or would you feel lost without me?
'Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is I don't care how they feel about my feelings
I made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams
I guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend
And I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit
Okay, the day I was nine
I've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time
And dammit, look at me now, fuck
Fuck, pen runnin' out, shit, fu—, ugh
Look, just know it's a new day
But if you reading this, then it's prolly too late, blaow!

[Chorus]
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me

[Verse 2]
I hope you got what you wanted
I hope you finally happy, it's too late for you
Been going out of my mind
You don't know how many times that I done prayed for you
I hope you hear me, goddammit
'Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you
I used to shine, now I'm all in the dark
I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart
But goddammit, look at you now, it's all of your fault
How could you? Maybe it's my fault
I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'
Maybe I should have been more of an influence
I can't believe that you're dead, I fu–
I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it
But I'll forever be attached to you (Damn)
Part of me feels bad for you
A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you
And I don't mean to be insensitive
But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit
You took the easy way out, goddammit, you did
I mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset
How could you be so selfish?
Nigga, how could you be so selfish?
Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless
I wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself
Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? (Say for yourself)
Look, I really feel lost without you
I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is: I don't care how you feel about my feelings
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen
I know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes
I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
I'm sorry this is something that we both couldn't figure out
I wish I could hear you now, is your soul missing?
I wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?
Tell me what death is like
Was it meant for you, brodie? Did the heaven support it?
Are you fucking happy now? Did you get what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted? I feel the temperature falling
And you've been suicidal back then you were nine?
Yeah, even back then, you was nine
We was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at you now, shit
But it's a new day
And if you can't hear me, it's probably too late, fuck!

[Chorus]
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me

Or a teenage rocker Or the girls in France
Yes, we all are partners in this cosmic dance

Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device

I wanted all things to make sense
So we'd be happy instead of tense

Oh a sleeping drunkard Up in Central Park
Or the lion hunter In the jungle dark

Or the Chinese dentist Or the British Queen
They all fit together In the same machine

Hoy voy a empezar
Hoy es el comienzo del final
El cocodrilo
Astronauta soy en órbita lunar
Y ahora todo es mejor
La lluvia de asteroides ya pasó
No fue para tanto
Y desde aquí
Todo es insignificante
Nada es tan preocupante
Y el espacio es un lugar
Tan vacío sin tí

Sin control, sin dirección
La luz se fue, ¿a dónde voy?

Sin control, sin dirección
La luz se fue, ¿a dónde voy?

No volverás a ver
La mirada triste
Del chico que observaba el infinito
Llamando a la estación
Perdemos combustible
Y la tripulación
Se quiere despedir desde aquí
Dejo esta grabación
A falta de algo mejor
La soledad es un lugar
Tan vacío sin tí

122,Give It What You Got/Peace Pipe,"[Intro: Kid Frost]
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh it's on now, foo
Just when you heard it all, nah this ain't no gang story
This is a story about one of my homies
Yeah you know whats up
Hey yo Litefoot show them the real foo

[Verse 1: Litefoot & (Kid Frost)]
Last night I heard the cops say freeze
But now a days life on the rez ain't horses and teepees
I Never had a good day, its bad enough they took our land
Now we dealing with this B.I.A
But that's an Indian's life out in OK
I'm sendin' the smoke signals all the way to L.A
Put out the peace pipe, put on the war paint
Put down the bow and arrow, now I got an AK
And then Kid Frost stepped off the plane
This Mexican from LA is a little insane (loco)
Frost, My people got a problem, (what's that?)
You see they keeping us down, now do you think that we can solve them?
Strong arm straight up, that's the solution
Get your self an army and start a revolution
Pollution in the sky makes me cry
I'm proud to be a Cherokee and willing to die

[Chorus: Kid Frost]
OGs fighting to survive
They bout to recognize that I'm willing to die
OGs fighting to survive
They bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die

[Chorus: Kid Frost]
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize that I'm willing to die
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die

[Verse 2: Litefoot]
Fighting is in my blood, it's just the way that I am
I'm creeping with the Prophet and my Man Cheyenne
Circling the reservation like a vulture
And granddaddy always kept me up on my culture (that's right)
So I'm proud to be a Cherokee
And the United States government ain't scaring me
Back in the days they killed Indians for salaries
I call the one time a modern day Calvary
What's gonna happen when we fight back?
Strap the guns again man, they ain't gonna like that
They gonna have to come and get me
Black boots and hundreds of troops like 1860
So listen to the words that I'm writing
If I'm going down, bet your ass I was fighting
Ask me what I am and I can never deny
I'm an Indian, homeboy, and I'm willing to die

[Chorus: Kid Frost]
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize that I'm willing to die
OGs fighting to survive
They 'bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die

[Post-Chorus: Kid Frost]
Yeah, are you willing to die?
Yeah, are you willing to die?

[Verse 3: Litefoot]
We the only people in the world without a motherland
Legally that is, but I'll explain it on another chance
I been American before there were Americans (Americans)
Back when they to call my people redskins (redskins)
Have you ever herd of Billy Jack
Well this is Litefoot Homeboy and I'm a little worse than that
I come equipped with a 30 shot clip
And my tribe got the vibe so they ready to trip
Somebody gotta take a stance so I'ma stand up
Talk about the problem and I'ma bring the land up
You took this country and you demented it
You saw a land that was green and you cemented it
Machinery replaced all the greenery
And now you acting like you shouldn't mean a thing to me
So I'ma organize and give it one more try
You see I'm Cherokee and willing to die

[Chorus: Kid Frost]

They 'bout to recognize that I'm willing to die

They 'bout to recognize the tribe's willing to die

Interview, interlude in the nude with my boo thang
Got the flu with the tea remedy for my boo thang
My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey
I swear he love me, my tummy almost got ready
For biddi-baby spaghetti and teddy bear in my window now
Golden child, always smile

Ask me why she said goodbye, why baby dyin' white walls
Cigarettes over skyfall, writing this like it's my song

I could see that she loves me, I know her heart is heavy

Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Yeah it's the way we are
We were smoking by 11 and knocking 'round town
Beat 'em ups on my arm
We were never good at selling, couldn't cut down
And I stay with my father while his friends die of heart attacks
He's got a heart made of stone but he never gets cold because the sun's always on his back
""I used to think you were cool and I believed you had a wonderful vision
But I soon found out you're a terrible friend and your mother's on the television""
Give's a go on your bike, how you getting along with your life?
It's alright
Yeah it's alright

Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby

""Well I'm coming to the end of 23,"" she said, ""is that alright?""
""Well, it's coming to the end of you and me,"" she said, ""is that alright?""
And how can you complain about life and talk about being bored?
If you just sit at Pete's house playing video games, doing sniff that you can't afford
I can't be picking up in the town
So get me one off Adam if he's sorting you out
I don't really care what all your friends were about
I was always looking for a way to get out
It's just a reflection on the size of your house
A silver spoon and a zoot in your mouth
But you're alright
Yeah it's alright

Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright

[Verse 3]
So here we are, it's quarter to 11, we're knocking 'round town
Pushing in, in the bar, you can cry until 11, it's a quarter of an hour
And why stay if you hate it so much?
You think you're well cool
You just write about sex and killing yourself and how you hardly ever went to school
Don't you want to take me up in the clouds?
Pretend that I'm the one and you can show me about
She was talking marriage so we had to get out
Now he's making up for it by sleeping about
Your ultimatum's a ridiculous joke
I'm gonna pick that option that allows me to smoke
But I'm alright
Yeah it's alright

Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby

People talking about what's right and what's wrong
But I think I gotta tell you about it one more time

Revolution evolution execution
These are facts of life we gotta deal with them right now
I remember when every man had a friend
He could depend on
But my oh my how times have changed
People can't even recall each other's name
And I'm tired of all this stress and strain

Cause we all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all Gotta stick together

Well you know it's going to be a scene
If we can't begin loving each other more and more every day
Share in each other's love and trust and pride
As we go through life side by side
Together

Yeah We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together

Everybody we should throw away our pride
And we shouldn't hide all the things we feel for one another
Oh it's popular today to say that love is dead
Naw it's fretting that's dead and we're all going to live together one more time

We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together
We all gotta stick together

Get a whole new outlook
From your view

Come on out
Where it's warm
It won't do any harm

Until you're back in my arms, dear

But it's not much comfort when I'm cryin' all night

Are running out of patience with me

Hand on the telephone

A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something
We both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes I loved you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust

It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were

Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta find out how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

Scream down the boulevard

In an everlasting kiss

Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness

An argument follows.

Chuffy was a nangel then and his soard fleshed light like like-ning. Fools top! Singty, sangty, meekly loose, defendy nous from prowlabouts. Make a shine on the curst. Emen.

But the duvlin sulph was in Glugger, that lost-to-lurning. Punct. He was sbuffing and sputing, tussing like anisine, whip-ping his eyesoult and gnatsching his teats over the brividies from existers and the outher liubbocks of life. He halth kelchy chosen a clayblade and makes prayses to his three of clubs. To part from these, my corsets, is into overlusting fear. Acts of feet, hoof and jarrety: athletes longfoot. Djowl, uphere!

Aminxt that nombre of evelings, but how pierceful in their so-jestiveness were those first girly stirs, with zitterings of flight re — leased and twinglings of twitchbells in rondel after, with waver — ings that made shimmershake rather naightily all the duskcended airs and shylit beaconings from shehind hims back. Sammy, call on. Mirrylamb, she was shuffering all the diseasinesses of the unherd of. Mary Louisan Shousapinas! If Arck could no more salve his agnols from the wiles of willy wooly woolf!

And they are met, face a facing. They are set, force to force. And no such Copenhague–Marengo was less so fated for a fall since in Glenasmole of Smiling Thrushes Patch Whyte passed O’Sheen ascowl.

Arrest thee, scaldbrother! came the evangelion, sabre accu-sant, from all Saint Joan’s Wood to kill or maim him, and be dumm but ill s’arrested. Et would proffer to his delected one the his trifle from the grass.

Item. He was hardset then. He wented to go (somewhere) while he was weeting. Utem. He wished to grieve on the good persons, that is the four gentlemen. Otem.

He was at his thinker’s aunts to give (the four gentlemen) the presence (of a curpse). And this is what he would be willing.

Ah ho! This poor Glugg! It was so said of him about of his old fontmouther. Truly deplurabel! A dire, O dire! And all the freight-fullness whom he inhebited after his colline born janitor. Some — time towerable! With that hehry antlets on him and the bauble — light bulching out of his sockets whiling away she sprankled his allover with her noces of interregnation: How do you do tha-t lack a lock and pass the poker, please? And bids him tend her, lute and airly. Sing, sweetharp, thing to me anone! So that Glugg, the poor one, in that limbopool which was his subnesciousness he could scares of all knotknow whither his morrder had bourst a blabber or if the vogalstones that hit his tynpan was that mearly his skoll missed her. Misty’s trompe or midst his flooting? Ah, ho! Cicely, awe!

The youngly delightsome frilles-inpleyurs are now showen drawen, if bud one, or, if in florileague, drawens up consociately at the hinder sight of their commoner guardian.

Tireton, cacheton, tire-ton, ba! Doth that not satisfy youth, sir? Quanty purty bellas, here, Madama Lifay! And what are you going to charm them to, Madama, do say? Cinderynelly angled her slipper; it was cho chiny yet braught her a groom. He will angskt of them from their commoner guardian at next lineup (who is really the rapier of the two though thother brother can hold his own, especially for he bandished it with his hand the hold time, mamain, a simply gra-cious: Mi, O la!), and reloose that thong off his art: Hast thou feel liked carbunckley ones? Apun which his poohoor pricoxity theirs is a little tittertit of hilarity (Lad-o’-me-soul! Lad-o’-me-soul, see!) and the wordchary is atvoiced ringsoundinly by their toots ensembled, though not meaning to be clever, but just with a shrug of their hips to go to troy and harff a freak at himself by all that story to the ulstramarines. Otherwised, holding their noises, they insinuate quiet private, Ni, he make peace in his preaches and play with esteem.

Warewolff! Olff! Toboo!

So olff for his topheetuck the ruck made raid, aslick aslegs would run; and he ankered on his hunkers with the belly belly prest. Asking: What’s my muffinstuffinaches for these times?

As Rigagnolina to Mountagnone, what she meaned he could not can. All she meaned was golten sylvup, all she meaned was some Knight’s ploung jamn. It’s driving her dafft like he’s so dumnb.

He has lost.

Off to clutch, Glugg! Forwhat! Shape your reres, Glugg! Foreweal! Ring we round, Chuff! Fairwell! Chuffchuff’s inners even. All’s rice with their whorl!

Yet, ah tears, who can her mater be? She’s promised he’d eye her. To try up her pretti. But now it’s so longed and so fared and so forth. Jerry for jauntings. Alabye! Fled.

The flossies all and mossies all they drooped upon her draped brimfall. The bowknots, the showlots, they wilted into woeblots. The pearlagraph, the pearlagraph, knew whitchly whether to weep or laugh. For always down in Carolinas lovely Dinahs vaunt their view.
Poor Isa sits a glooming so gleaming in the gloaming; the tin-celles a touch tarnished wind no lovelinoise awound her swan’s. Hey, lass! Woefear gleam she so glooming, this pooripathete I solde? Her beauman’s gone of a cool. Be good enough to symper-ise. If he’s at anywhere she’s therefor to join him. If it’s to no — where she’s going to too. Buf if he’ll go to be a son to France’s she’ll stay daughter of Clare. Bring tansy, throw myrtle, strew rue, rue, rue. She is fading out like Journee’s clothes so you can’t see her now. Still we know how Day the Dyer works, in dims and deeps and dusks and darks. And among the shades that Eve’s now wearing she’ll meet anew fiancy, tryst and trow. Mammy was, Mimmy is, Minuscoline’s to be. In the Dee dips a dame and the dame desires a demselle but the demselle dresses dolly and the dolly does a dulcydamble. The same renew. For though she’s unmerried she’ll after truss up and help that hussyband how to hop. Hip it and trip it and chirrub and sing. Lord Chuffy’s sky sheraph and Glugg’s got to swing.

So and so, toe by toe, to and fro they go round, for they are the ingelles, scattering nods as girls who may, for they are an angel’s garland.
Catchmire stockings, libertyed garters, shoddyshoes, quicked out with selver. Pennyfair caps on pinnyfore frocks and a ring on her fomefing finger. And they leap so looply, looply, as they link to light. And they look so loovely, loovelit, noosed in a nuptious night. Withasly glints in. Andecoy glants out. They ramp it a little, a lessle, a lissle. Then rompride round in rout.

Say them all but tell them apart, cadenzando coloratura! R is Rubretta and A is Arancia, Y is for Yilla and N for greeneriN. B is Boyblue with odalisque O while W waters the fleurettes of no-vembrance. Though they’re all but merely a schoolgirl yet these way went they. I’ th’ view o’ th’avignue dancing goes entrancing roundly. Miss Oodles of Anems before the Luvium doeslike. So. And then again doeslike. So. And miss Endles of Eons efter Dies of Eirae doeslike. So.

The grocer’s bawd she slips her hand in the haricot bag, the lady in waiting sips her sup from the paraffin can, Mrs Wildhare Quickdoctor helts her skelts up the casuaway the flasht instinct she herds if a tinkle of tunder, the widow Megrievy she knits cats’ cradles, this bountiful actress leashes a harrier under her tongue, and here’s the girl who she’s kneeled in coldfashion and she’s told her priest (spt!) she’s pot on a chap (chp!) and this lass not least, this rickissime woman, who she writes foot fortunes money times over in the nursery dust with her capital thumb. Buzz. All run-away sheep bound back bopeep, trailing their teenes behind them. And these ways wend they. And those ways went they. Winnie, Olive and Beatrice, Nelly and Ida, Amy and Rue. Here they come back, all the gay pack, for they are the florals, from foncey and pansey to papavere’s blush, foresake-me-nought, while there’s leaf there’s hope, with primtim’s ruse and marry-may’s blossom, all the flowers of the ancelles’ garden.

But vicereversing thereout from those palms of perfection to anger arbour, treerack monatan, scroucely out of scout of ocean, virid with woad, what tornaments of complementary rages rocked the divlun from his punchpoll to his tummy’s shentre as he dis-plaid all the oathword science of his visible disgrace. He was feeling so funny and floored for the cue, all over which girls as he don’t know whose hue. If goosseys gazious would but fain smile him a smile he would be fondling a praise he ate some nice bit of fluff. But no geste reveals the unconnouth. They’re all odds against him, the beasties. Scratch. Start.

He dove his head into Wat Murrey, gave Stewart Ryall a puck on the plexus, wrestled a hurry-come-union with the Gillie Beg, wiped all his sinses, martial and menial, out of Shrove Sundy MacFearsome, excremuncted as freely as any frothblower into MacIsaac, had a belting bout, chaste to chaste, with McAdoo about nothing and, childhood’s age being aye the shameleast, tel a Tartaran tastarin toothsome tarrascone tourtoun, vestimentiv-orous chlamydophagian, imbretellated himself for any time un tellable with what hung over to the Machonochie Middle from the MacSiccaries of the Breeks.

Right for Rovy the Roder. From the safe side of distance! Libera, nostalgia! Beate Laurentie O’Tuli, Euro pra nobis! Every monk his own cashel where every little ligger is his own liogotenente with inclined jambs in full purview to his pronaose and to the deretane at his reredoss. Fuisfinister, fuyerescaper! He would, with the greatest of ease, before of weighting midhook, by dear home trashold on the raging canal, for othersites of Jorden, (heave a hevy, waterboy!) make one of hissens with a knockonacow and a chow collegions and fire off, gheol ghiornal, foull subustioned mullmud, his farced epistol to the hibruws.

Now a run for his money! Now a dash to her dot! Old cocker, young crowy sifadda, sosson. A bran new, speedhount, out-stripperous on the wind. Like a waft to wingweary one or a sos to a coastguard. For directly with his whoop, stop and an upa-lepsy didando a tishy, in appreciable less time than it takes a glaciator to submerger an Atlangthis, was he again, agob, before the trembly ones, a spark’s gap off, doubledasguesched, gotten orlop in a simplasailormade and shaking the storm out of his hiccups. The smartest vessel you could find would elazilee him on her knee as her lucky for the Rio Grande. He’s a pigtaiI tarr and if he hadn’t got it toothick he’d a telltale tall of his pitcher on a wall with his photure in the papers for cutting moutonlegs and capers, letting on he’d jest be japers and his tail cooked up.

Hymnumber twentynine. O, the singing! Happy little girly-cums to have adolphted such an Adelphus! O, the swinginging hopops so goholden! They’ve come to chant en chor. They say their salat, the madiens’ prayer to the messiager of His Nabis, prostitating their selfs eachwise and combinedly. Fateha, fold the hands. Be it honoured, bow the head.

But heed! Our thirty minutes war’s alull. All’s quiet on the felled of Gorey. Between the starfort and the thornwood brass castle flambs with mutton candles. Hushkah, a horn! Gadolmag-tog! God es El?

Look sharp, she’s signalling from among the asters. Turn again, wistfultone, lode mere of Doubtlynn! Arise, Land-under-Wave! Clap your lingua to your pallet, drop your jowl with a jolt, tambourine until your breath slides, pet a pout and it’s out. Have you got me, Allysloper?

Oh, it's been getting so hard
Living with the things you do to me, aha
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see

[Refrain]
Oh, I see a man at the back
As a matter of fact, his eyes are as red as a sun
And a girl in the corner, let no one ignore her
Cause she thinks she's the passionate one

[Build]
Oh, yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Chorus]
And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing is all I ever do
Oh, I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you, aha

[Refrain]
Now the man in the back
Is ready to crack as he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye

[Build]
Oh yeah, it was electric
So frantically hectic
And the band started leaving
Cause they all stopped breathing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Chorus]
And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz

138,Sailing,"Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

Oh, the canvas can do miracles

Really, believe me

Take money, take money, money, money
Make money, make money, money, money
Take money, take money, money, money

[Verse 1: KXNG Crooked]
I'm King Kong, this my theme song
With Sky on the hook, we touch Kareems Soul
Your team's on, homie dream on
In the movie about pussies you play the lead role
Sensitive rapper, oh sensitive rappers
We meant to get active, we interact with killers and factors
We chillin' with trappers, we in the back with infamous jackers
And infinite clappers roast to the back
We get the shit crackin' exactly like that
The streets give me a hundred dollar credit
Keep it one hundred, nothin' sweet like a fuckin' diabetic
And Hip Hop ain't dead, but radio programmers should be
Fuck it, I just said it, nothing I regretted, unapologetic
This whole rap industry's like a survival quest
And the idiot sittin' behind the desk is your final test
First they'll censor you then tax you like the IRS
Jerk me for my money, you better buy a vest
You better have a iron chest
It's like a couple of pervs with ear fetishes
Fuck what you've heard, you're ear-relevant
Whether jugglin' birds or hustlin' words
For mathematics, we 'bout action, that's numbers and verbs
Yeah

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9""]
I'm a legendary rapper, clap a TEC quick
Blastin' at your baby bassinet
Snap a neck, snatch a necklace
All I see is money, pussy, fame, power
Sixty minute flights through them rain showers
That's because the plane's ours
'Bout to turn these money stacks to algebra
And shotgun your passenger
You're about to take a dirt nap like Africa
And we the fuckin' money team, read it and weep
Ask me why I'm leavin' the D? I'm bob and weavin' the heat
Modesty is the least, while respect is just a catch 22
Give it to get it or expect it, just catch 22
They call me King Karma, I've seen crowns layed down in extreme carnage
Put mean garmets between me and armor
And I ain't even rhymin' man, I'm just being honest man
I would have your body lyin' in your home
While your soul flyin' to the promise land
Bitches actin' like I gotta go home, 'cause I'm in they stomach like sonograms

Man, nobody talk a nigga like I'm in a wheelchair
You stay tryna walk a nigga, I'm from New York nigga
Pull out, bang 'em with the hawk nigga
Bom bom bom, outlined in chalk nigga
Stick a fork in a nigga, I'm in the gym jumpin' rope
Liftin' weights, spidey mags, speedbags, you can't cope
Every word that I've ever said, you hang on to it
And even though I said it, it wasn't truth, ya ain't gon' do it
'Cause I, write in my books 'cause my books is what I say
And what I say is my life, 'cause the life took away
'Cause the path has been dark for oh so long
Spit it from the heart from the start, it can't go wrong

Oh to take his place forever
There's nothing I wouldn't give
Just to prove to you daily
What a man really is

I'd lay down my life loving you
I'd work day and night loving you
And when God calls us both above
Honey, you'll know that you'd been loved
For I'll go to my grave loving you

I'd lay down my life loving you
I'd work day and night loving you

151,To Each His Own,"[Intro: Pete Rock]
Yeah, uhh uhh InI is in the place
Yeahyeah uuh
Along with my man Extra P and my man Q-T
Here in the place to be
With the capital P, Rock on

[Verse 1: Grap Luva]
Vibrations from my voice bring life to microphones
If I make wrong moves then I'm headed for the dead zone
You heads flown and it's a crazy mess
You should've fessed when it came time to test the best
So next up is the one, the non-half stepper
The keeper of the door, healer of the lepers
Controller of the greed seed, with no ego to feed
Cause I stays level headed, vocabulary
Embedded up in the dome
I'm bound to crush Rome and let my spirit roam free
See it's the G bring it to you in the physical
Comin' through with the crucial raw material
I entertain each time I'm in the session
Leavin' brothers guessin', yo, what's that sound?
Got 'em wishin' they was on this pitcher's mound throwin' down
InI vibrations over plump tracks
Most of y'all clown cats couldn't match that
Touch this, I don't think you should attempt to
Cause if you do, of course I got to exempt you
From gettin any clout
No doubt, to each his own

[Hook]
To each his own (repeat 8 times)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Check it out to each his own, watch out cat
Niggas fake jacks to get a dollar bill
The choices made, they choose to ill
In Sodom and Gomorrah, survival is a horror
Scrams, let's make a move, you tryin' to be top scorer
And he really don't give a rat's ass who he go through
He's a big boy, he bites all he can chew
But yo, I eat on plates with hip-hop written on it
Pete Rock, the group InI shittin' on it
Lyrically impressive, ain't no second guesses
The most poppin' shit talker is the one who stresses
And you see the Abstract with a tight lipped carry
Speakin' on my peace and my soul is never varied
To my microphone I dialogue
It answers back with a whole lot a love, complemented with claps
I'm on some Grown Man shit, my peak is not yet reached
So, I remind my own and think of each
To each his own

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rob-O]
Excuse me, I'm here to earn a mere a buck or two
Now, take a chance with life or loser fuckin' you
All your friends, you're fly but why pretend?
You used to be shy but now you want be my skins
On the D-L, this is gonna swell for a second
But if I'm catchin' wreck
How many others is she steppin' in the sack with?
Guess I better get a prophylactic
Back to the crib in case I smack it
Bad tactic 'cause a jim hat caught a flat
Plus the boots, they wasn't even all of that
Now it's hectic, I'm jettin' to the joint to get injected
Bust it, the fact that I'm infected, so, check it out, yo
When you with these chicks and they spread out
With skins enough to take ya head out
Use precaution 'cause hookers packin' death behind a zit
Peace to the Gods and watch your dick
To each his own

[Verse 4: Large Professor]
To each his own, niggas is sown by the full-blown
Brother who could never be a clone
Large Pro, so fuck your bullshit hard show
I'm reppin' with the weapon, my whole squad glow
Like a diamond, so don't sham, fam, I have to climb in
That ass like a truck, leavin' niggas just struck
Like a lightnin' bolt, the cash flow goes right in the vault
In the end, peace to len times ten
Cee-Lo, the whole InI is my people
So, sit back relax and just listen while we pull
The moneys and honeys, fake frauds get thrown
To each his own, to each his own

152,Ain't No Way To Treat A Lady,"She was just sixteen
She was so sweet and clean
She walked just like she knew where she'd been
She set my blood on fire
I said are you for hire?
That's when she turned on me and screamed

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

She had a southern smile
Had a New York style
I couldn't let her get away
She was the girl of my dreams
And because I was mean
I had to listen to her say

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

I had to have her bad
But she left me mad
That ain't the way it should be
I'm going to find that girl
Take her around the world
I'm going to love her till she screams

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way
That ain't no way to treat a lady

153,The Music Never Stopped,"[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!

[Bridge]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy, Lord
The band kept us too busy we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band, Lord
They're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on
Keep on dancing thru the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Outro]
Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing

Doch alles, was sie hab'n, macht für uns keinen Sinn
Doch geben ein'n Dreck auf die Rolex

[Part 1: Kontra K]
Wir hatten zu wenig, aber davon reichlich
Die Air Max tot, aber trugen uns weit weg
Heute im Mercedes AMG, alles Hightech
Was bringt mir die Scheiße, wenn ich darin allein sitz'?
Worte hatten recht, weil sie ehrlich gemeint sind
Versprechen einen Sinn, denn sie wurden gehalten
Doch hier ist die Liebe keinen Cent mehr wert
Denn sie hält nur so lange, wie die Spotlights scheinen
Warum willst du weg von dem Glück, was du hast?
Es wäre perfekt, genau so, wie es war
Ich halt' den Moment fest, solang ich noch kann
Doch er verschwindet im Schatten, geht das Rampenlicht an
Es wird nie sein wie früher, wir nenn'n uns noch Brüder
Und seh'n uns maximal einmal im Jahr
Doch jedes Like, jeder Gig, jede goldene Platte
Zerschneidet nur weiter das Band

Kein Hit, kein Hype bleibt mehr, wenn du liegst
Kein Fick, kein Nike, kein Stift, kein Mic

161,Better By The Pound,"(George Clinton/Eddie Hazel)

Pleasure is the motivation
For the human race
Everything starts and ends with sex
And appeal
Feeling good is the bait
They use to fish for you and me
Comfort is the poison
It's your spirit they want to kill
There's a tidal wave of mysticism
Surging through our space-aged generation
And it's all designed
To take you to the sky

There's such a need
To get nice
And feel nice
And I need it more than I ought to
I said
My preacher keeps promisin' satisfaction
The ladies keep giving up the gratifaction
You know what?
I'm feeling better
By the pound

There's a tidal wave of mysticism
Surging through our space-aged generation
And it's all designed
To take you to the sky
Take you to the sky
Take you to the sky

I'm feeling better by the pound
By the pound

There's a tidal wave of mysticism
Surging through our space-aged generation
Try to take your mind
It's all designed
To take you to the sky
Take you to the sky
Take you to the sky

I'm feeling better by the pound
Yeah

Satisfaction
Gratifaction

There's a tidal wave of mysticism
Surging through our space-aged generation
And it's all designed
To take you to the sky
Take you to the sky
Take you to the sky

Surging through our space-aged generation

162,Every Day I Have To Cry Some,"There was a little girl
I had planned to marry
This was my love
I didn`t want to share it
I thought that love would
Make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn`t love me
Cause I didn`t have no money
So, every day, I have to cry some
Every day, I have to cry some
Drive the water from my eyes some
Every day, I have to cry
I had me a girl
And yes, I really loved her
Log on to kill this message
Every night, well, I was
Thinking of her
But you can`t
Mix love with money
Cause if you do
You`re gonna hurt somebody
And every day, I have to cry some
Every day, I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day, I have to cry
Now, Lord, I know
That I`m just a poor man
But is it wrong to love
Cause I`m not a rich man
But you can`t
Mix love with money
Cause every time
It hurts somebody
And every day, I have to cry some
Every day, I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day, I have to cry
But you can`t
Mix love with money
Cause if you do
You`re gonna hurt somebody
Every day, I have to, ooh, cry some
Every day, I have to cry some....",Arthur Alexander,1975,"[46, 45, 45, 52, 63, 68, 71, 73, 86]",9

164,There Goes Another Love Song,"Sometimes I feel like I'm getting kinda low
Thoughts that I'm thinkin' are the reason
So I try to remember without talkin' to myself
Things that I said or maybe things that I felt about you

Sittin' in a corner of a crowded bar room
People all around me and I still feel alone
Just when I know I'm gonna break down and cry
Someone played a tune that dried the tear from my eye

There goes another love song
Someone singin' about me again
There goes another love song
Now I need more than a friend

Lonesome and lonely, far from my home
Tryin' to get back to where I know I belong
Wishin' and hopin' I was already there
I just heard a voice whispered in my ear, singin'

There goes another love song
Someone singin' about me again
There goes another love song
Now I need more than a friend

There goes another love song
Someone singin' about me again
There goes another love song
Now I need it more than a friend

There goes another love song
Someone singin' about me again
There goes another love song
Now I need more than a friend",The Outlaws (Southern Rock Band),1975,"[51, 48, 34, 35, 39, 43, 50, 60, 68, 79]",10
165,Dreaming A Dream,"[Chorus]
I'm dreamin' a dream
Where love's the place
I'm dreamin' a dream
And always is the time

[Verse 1]
There's a game that you play
And it's called love me true
Love me hard but don't stay
It's a part of the play
While you hide from the sun
You lie and then run
You lie and then run

[Chorus]
I'm dreamin' a dream
Where love's the place
I'm dreamin' a dream
And always is the time

[Verse 2]
I have seen how your eyes
Fill with hungry surprise
At the song of some poet
Who looked at the sky

[Verse 3]
I have seen in your face
All the gone crazy dreams
That are hidden down deep
In your eyes fast asleep
Like the tears you don't weep
Like the love you're not in
For love is a sin

I'm dreamin' a dream
Where love's the place
I'm dreamin' a dream
And always is the time

166,Manhattan Spiritual,"This winter marked the third anniversary of the Chicago opening of “The Glass Menagerie,” an event that terminated one part of my life and began another about as different in all external circumstances as could well be imagined. I was snatched out of virtual oblivion and thrust into sudden prominence, and from the precarious tenancy of furnished rooms about the country I was removed to a suite in a first-class Manhattan hotel. My experience was not unique. Success has often come that abruptly into the lives of Americans. The Cinderella story is our favorite national myth, the cornerstone of the film industry if not of the Democracy itself. I have seen it enacted on the screen so often that I was now inclined to yawn at it, not with disbelief but with an attitude of Who Cares! Anyone with such beautiful teeth and hair as the screen protagonist of such a story was bound to have a good time one way or another, and you could bet your bottom dollar and all the tea in China that one would be caught dead or alive at any meeting involving a social conscience.

No, my experience was not exceptional, but neither was it quite ordinary, and if you are willing to accept the somewhat eclectic proposition that I had not been writing with such an experience in mind and many people are not willing to believe that a playwright is interested in anything but popular success—there may be some point in comparing the two estates.

The sort of life that I had had previous to this popular success was one that required endurance, a life of clawing and scratching along a sheer surface and holding on tight with raw fingers to every inch of rock higher than the one caught hold of before, but it was a good life because it was the sort of life for which the human organism is created.

I was not aware of how much vital energy had gone into this struggle until the struggle was removed. I was out on a level plateau with my arms still thrashing and my lungs still grabbing at air that no longer resisted. This was security at last.

I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly very depressed. I thought to myself, this is just a period of adjustment. Tomorrow morning, I will wake up in this first-class hotel suite above the discreet hum of an East Side boulevard and I will appreciate its elegance and luxuriate in its comforts and know that I have arrived at our American plan of Olympus. Tomorrow morning when I look at the green satin sofa I will fall in love with it. It is only temporarily that the green satin looks like slime on stagnant water.

But in the morning the inoffensive little sofa looked more revolting than the night before and I was already getting too fat for the $125 suit which a fashionable acquaintance had selected for me. In the suite things began to break accidentally. An arm came off the sofa. Cigarette burns appeared on the polished surface of the furniture. Windows were left open and a rain storm flooded the suite But the maid always put it straight and the patience of the management was inexhaustible. Late parties could not offend them seriously. Nothing short of demolition bomb seemed to bother my neighbors.

I lived on room service. But in this, too, there was a disenchantment. Some time between the moment when I ordered dinner over the phone and when it was rolled into my living room like a corpse on a rubber-wheeled table, I lost all interest in it. Once I ordered a sirloin steak and a chocolate sundae, but everything was so cunningly disguised on the table that I mistook the chocolate sauce for gravy and poured it over the sirloin steak.

Of course all this was the more trivial aspect of a spiritual dislocation that began to manifest itself in far more disturbing ways. I soon found myself becoming indifferent to people. A well cynicism rose in me. Conversations all sounded as if they had been recorded years ago and were being played back on a turntable. Sincerity and kindliness seemed to have gone out of my friends’ voices. I suspected them of hypocrisy. I stopped calling them, stopped seeing them. I was impatient of what I took to be inane flattery.

I got so sick of hearing people say, “I loved your play!” that I could not say thank you any more. I choked on the words and turned rudely away from the usually sincere person. I no longer felt any pride in the play itself but began to dislike it, probably because I felt too lifeless inside ever to create another. I was walking around dead in my shoes and I knew it but there were no friends I knew or trusted sufficiently, at that time, to take them aside and tell them what was the matter.

This curious condition persisted about three months, till late spring, when I decided to have another eye operation mainly because of the excuses it gave me to withdraw from the world behind a gauze mask. It was my fourth eye operation, and perhaps I should explain that I had been afflicted for about five years with a cataract on my left eye which required a series of needling operations and finally an operation on the muscle of the eye. (The eye is still in my head. So much for that.)

Well, the gauze mask served a purpose. While I was resting in the hospital the friends whom I had neglected or affronted in one way or another began to call on me and now that I was in pain and darkness, unpleasant mutation which I had suspected earlier in the season had now disappeared and they sounded now as they had used to sound in the lamented days of my obscurity. Once more they were sincere and kindly voices with the ring of truth in them and that quality of understanding for which I had originally sought them out.

As far as my physical vision was concerned, this last operation was only relatively successful (although it left me with an apparently clear black pupil in the right position, or nearly so) but in another, figurative way, it had served a much deeper purpose.

When the gauze mask was removed I found myself in a readjusted world. I checked out of the handsome suite at the first-class hotel, packed my papers and a few incidental belongings and left for Mexico, an elemental country where you can quickly forget the false dignities and conceits imposed by success, a country where vagrants innocent as children curl up to sleep on the pavements and human voices, especially when their language is not familiar to the ear, are soft as birdsâ€™. My public self, that artifice of mirrors, did not exist here and so my natural being was resumed.

Then, as a final act of restoration, I settled for a while at Chapala to work on a play called “The Poker Night,” which later became “A Streetcar Named Desire.” It is only in his work that an artist can find reality and satisfaction, for the actual world is less intense than the world of his invention and consequently his life, without recourse to violent disorder, does not seem very substantial. The right condition for him is that in which his work is not only convenient but unavoidable.

For me a convenient place to work is a remote place among strangers where there is good swimming. But life should require a certain minimal effort. You should not have too many people waiting on you, you should have to do most things for yourself. Hotel service is embarrassing. Maids, waiters, bellhops, porters and so forth are the most embarrassing people in the world for they continually remind you of inequities which we accept as the proper thing. The sight of an ancient woman, gasping and wheezing as she drags a heavy pail of water down a hotel corridor to mop up the mess of some drunken overprivileged guest, is one that sickens and weighs upon the heart and withers it with shame for this world in which it is not only tolerated but regarded as proof positive that the wheels of Democracy are functioning as they should without interference from above or below. Nobody should have to clean up anybody else’s mess in this world. It is terribly bad for both parties, but probably worse for the one receiving the service.

I have been corrupted as much as anyone else by the vast number of menial services which our society has grown to expect and depend on. We should do for ourselves or let the machines do for us, the glorious technology that is supposed to be the new light of the world. We are like a man who has bought up a great amount of equipment for a camping trip, who has the canoe and the tent and the fishing lines and the axe and the guns, the mackinaw and the blankets, but who now, when all the preparations and the provisions are piled expertly together, is suddenly too timid to set out on the journey but remains where he was yesterday and the day before and the day before that, looking suspiciously through white lace curtains at the clear sky he distrusts. Our great technology is a God-given chance for adventure and for progress which we are afraid to attempt. Our ideas and our ideals remain exactly what they were and where they were three centuries ago. No. I beg your pardon. It is no longer safe for man to even declare them!

This is a long excursion from a small theme into a large one which I did not intend to make, so let me go back to what I was saying before.

This is an oversimplification. One does not escape that easily from the seduction of an effete way of life. You cannot arbitrarily say to yourself, I will not continue my life as it was before this thing, Success, happened to me. But once you fully apprehend the vacuity of a life without struggle you are equipped with the basic means of salvation. Once you know this is true, that the heart of man, his body and his brain, are forged in a white-hot furnace for the purpose of conflict (the struggle of creation) and that with the conflict removed, the man is a sword cutting daisies, that not privation but luxury is the wolf at the door and that the fangs of this wolf are all the little vanities and conceits and laxities that Success is heir to—-why, then with this knowledge you are at least in a position of knowing where danger lies.

You know, then, that the public Somebody you are when you “have a name” is a fiction created with mirrors and that the only somebody worth being is the solitary and unseen you that existed from your first breath and which is the sum of your actions and so is constantly in a state of becoming under your own violation— and knowing these things, you can even survive the catastrophe of Success!

It is never altogether too late, unless you embrace the Bitch Goddess, as William James called her, with both arms and find in her smothering caresses exactly what the homesick little boy in you always wanted, absolute protection and utter effortlessness. Security is a kind of death, I think, and it can come to you in a storm of royalty checks beside a kidney-shaped pool in Beverly Hills or anywhere at all that is removed from the conditions that made you an artist, if that’s what you are or were intended to be. Ask, anyone who has experienced the kind of success I am talking about— What good is it? Perhaps to get an honest answer you will have to give him a shot of truth serum but the word he will finally groan is unprintable in genteel publications.

Then what is good? The obsessive interest in human affairs, plus a certain amount of compassion and moral conviction, that first made the experience of living something that must be translated into pigment or music or bodily movement or poetry or prose or anything that’s dynamic and expressive—that’s what’s good for you if you’re at all serious in your aims. William Saroyan wrote a great play on this theme, that purity of heart is the one success worth having. “In the time of your life—live!” That time is short and it doesn’t return again. It is slipping away while I write this and while you read it, and the monosyllable of the clock is Loss, loss, loss, unless you devote your heart to its opposition.",Tennessee Williams,1975,"[56, 56, 58, 64, 68, 79, 89]",7
167,Summer Of '42,"The summer smiles the summer knows
And un-ashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smoothes the restless sky
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes here summer time
Tell the moon to wait and the sun to linger

Twists the world round her summet finger

From that night on I knew I'd write songs
With Carolina in the pines

There's a new moon on the fourteenth
First Quarter the 21st
And the full moon in the last week
Brings a fullness to this earth
There's no guesswork in the clockwork

On the worlds part or mine
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines

When the frost shows on the windows
And the wood stove smokes and glows

Watching rainbows in the cove
And well talk of trails weve walked up
Far above the timberline

169,Letting Go,"[Instrumental and Percussion Intro]

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul (oh, woah oh, oh...)
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go (oh, woah, oh, oh...)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my old self I wonder if we still see alike
We was tight seeing lights, speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high. Life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted, trying to fall asleep. Lost inside my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul (oh, woah oh, oh...)
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go (oh, woah, oh, oh...)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
I'm begging me don't let me go, we vow like the letter ""O""
To never go our separate ways and spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin', playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits, livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow, can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room the entry wound. Let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is, unprepared and filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers shootin' out of you and me

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul (oh, woah oh, oh...)
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go (oh, woah, oh, oh...)

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Sometimes I feel like the world—
Sometimes I feel like the world is against me
And everything that I've done before
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
Cause I don't wanna fight this war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This Uzi weighs a ton, but I think I'm done!

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul (oh, woah oh, oh...)
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go (oh, woah, oh, oh...)

[Outro: Sarah Green]
Think I'll be letting you go
Things are getting outta control
Said, it feels like I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
I think I'll be letting you go

173,What's Happened To Blue Eyes/You Ain't Never Been Loved (Like I'm Gonna Lov,"[Verse 1: Pyramid Vritra]
How've things been since we last met?
Around the time I last slept
I heard you got a dude who treats you right and you're in love with him
That kinda sucks, But I'm glad
And as for me, I'm doing Grand
Life couldn't be better since you up and left
Grand Theft Cardiac
Things were swell until you moved away in 10th grade
And said that I would stay residing in your rib cage
And now you pull this shit
I tried to be with someone but she killed it
And I left that bitch locked inside of my mother's basement
Cause It didn't work
So bitch don't you say another word
If you were loved I'd put your satisfaction first
But fuck that
If I loved you any more I'd put you in a purple hearse
While getting nookie, stealing lines from Frederick Durst
But of curse
I see we've lost worth in you
We fell out
Falling down the tubes
Dirty Selsun blue
I guess it's cool
I never wanted to but I'll get over you
Pulls out an invitation and I'm like, ""This can't be fucking true..""

[Verse 2: Pyramid Vritra]
Who's this faggot Ellie?
Hope he has a lot of dough
And a bigger cock, and buys you horses, and he's fucking swoll
She laughing
I'm looking like, ""Tell that fag come at me bro
I'll spike my hair and wear nothing but extra small Ed Hardy clothes""
Think I'm fucking kidding? Do you, huh? You stupid chode
You promised me your heart
You're getting married and want me to show
Up in the church and you say your vows and watch you kiss
I'm chummy with the bride's maid and all those other lonely bitches
Shit, Ima pass and if I pass I'll probably crash
During ""Make it last,"" Telling the crowd to kiss my ass
So Maybe I'll get over it and show up with some older bitch
With gifts and shit, saying ""I'm happy for you,"" asking about your little ones
But if I never show, it's not cause my heart is cold
It's cause I wasn't chosen
To be the one you grow
Old with in Elder homes
And now I'm all alone
Coupled with a noose, the closet, and your favorite song
Fuck You

[Verse 3: Pyramid Vritra]
The past is in the past where you left me
But this meeting
Although brief'll be the last I'm attending
Falling in a pit of rage and grips of jealousy
Depression fuels my every breath
And every step you take induces blows
To the chest, knuckles gold
You in a dress that's white as snow
Increase damage hundreth fold
And now I'm under your control
Deprived of soul, im vexed
And the feeling's cold, Fuck it
I'll smoke the pain away Sativa got me froooze

[Bridge 1: Jay Cue]
Now I'm gone (Where ya go?)
Somewhere secret, you wouldn't know
Just know I'm looking at you down below (down below)
But If I didn't cope this way, I swear I'd end it all one day
But that's not today
I'll burn it all away

[Verse 4: Pyramid Vritra]
Shit, indica got me gone
Thoughts of what we could've been
Fuck anther date Ellie
I'm thinking bout the diamonds I would drench you in
Bragging to your friends about how we ... should be illegal
And calling you every night, to dig you out and scoop the Steelo
Now? All your girls are jealous and it's funny
But in reality we both know you never dumped me
Leaving for a few years then greeting with a fucking invitation to a weddding
Is like stabbing me while fucking, whatever happened to going steady?

The stress Kills me everyday its in my head
I got to get this feeling out my head (8x)

[Verse 5: Pyramid Vritra]
Stress piles up and I can't run away
Seeping through the inner walls of my inner membrane
Falling through the darkness via harem
Caged in bitter rage
Filled sleepless nights
The fact she'll be that nigga's wife kills me inside
FUCK IT!
Fuck her
Fuck us
This maldesigned, poorly structured love
Caves and flourishes before my eyes
Vivid
Staggered dagger blows into my heart
Make sure the thought's resides
Insuring I can get this concubine outta my system

[Bridge 3: Matt Martians]
I got to get this feeling out my head (8x)

[Verse 6: Pyramid Vritra]
These densly and pigmented thoughts are now my only friends
This closet I reside in stands for little more than failed attempts
Red hues penetrate my vision, air is hard to grasp
Falling to the carpet, Death's embrace was graced with slippery hands
Grim, you fucking up by letting Jesus inturrupt
Hals within a button up and tie adorns purple tux
I guess that I'm showing up, cause I can hardly give a fuck
I'll probably crash and scrape the dash and head on the the groom's truck

[Dialog 1: RoseGold Dutch Masters]
Howdy Y'all
Representing this here RoseGold
I know right?
Oh so you just gonna leave like right when I start talking on the mic
I see you, bitch nigga
I bet you ain't sippin on what I'm sippin on
That orange juice
Fuck with me nigga

[Bridge 4: RoseGold Dutch Masters]
After this wedding, then you and your girls can come over and fuck (3x)
After this wedding, then you and your girls can come over and fuck (Played In Reverse)
After this wedding, then you and your girls can come over and fuck (2½ times)
After this wedding, then you and your girls can come over and fuck (Resumed ½ In Reverse)

[Verse 7: Pyramid Vritra]
I crashed through the lonely hearts club in the front row
Yelling out obscenities, the children cupped their ears closed
""Your mother's a slut!"" I yelled
She calls me a psycho
But The voices in my talking head are killing me... (Bitch!)
Cheers flying, Mom's crying, Groom's dying
As soon as I find him, losing footing when the moonshine hits
Pastor's clutching his bible, mumbling shit in silence
And the waiter's like, ""I don't get paid for this, Y'all niggas wildin'""
Two police trucks pull up and bust through the cathedral doors
Yelling, ""No one move and everybody lay down on the floor!""
But little did they know my plan was free of any flaws or scorns
The cop grabs Elenor and throws Johnny's body towards the floor
And now he's looking up confused and asking God what he would do this for
I'm yapping on the free cakes and the hors d'oeuvre that they catered
Cop two's late, grabs the gun and shoots Elenor

[Dialog 2: Pyramid Vritra, Cop, Elenor]

-Pyramid Vritra-
What the fuck?! Man that wasn't part of the plan!
-Cop 2-
Wait wait wait wait wait..
He told me to and said that you would understand
-Pyramid Vritra-
Bitch, what's your fucking problem?
-Elenor-
Shes the problem and I love you!
-Pyramid Vritra-
No! Shut the fuck up!
-Elenor-
But I thought you felt the same about me!

[Verse 8: Pyramid Vritra]
Yadda yadda, feel this lead inside your rib cage
John stands up, Blood spattered, and he's enraged
Breaks out through the back, and heads around to get the 12-Gauge
I fired out a few and barely missed him and the fag escaped
So fuck it, I'll take this bitch and we'll plan our fucking getaway

[Verse 9: Vince Staples (as Johnny)]
What in the fuck was that?
Guess it's time to run to the back
Cause my guns in the back
Got a pump for this gassed up nigga tryna fuck my shit up
Hopefully this nigga learns not to fuck with me when I clip up. Shit!
Came here for a love and affection, Now a motherfucker embarrassed and pissed off
All this heartbreak shit gets my dick soft
Me and my bitch got a date with a rigshaw
Honeymoon down in Typhoon country
Quit with that cryin' cause a ho don't love me
Lose a ho and get soft like puffy
That's what a bitch nigga do
Don't let your heart get you hit with a tool
Run if you want but my whip do too
On the freeway ain't no duckin from the fades
Stay from the beach if you scared of the waves
Good on gas, put $50 on the tank
Catch you on the interstate like the freeway sniper
Round Dodge Viper
V12 Engine, Black backpack with a Mac-12 in it
Windows down, Front windshield tinted so you can't see me but I'm on your head
No doubt, I want you dead
Ice your mama if the bitch wanna go to the feds
Match the hole in your heart with a hole in your head
John 3:16 the story was read
When that nigga bled

[Verse 10:]
My..
Hat is fitted trucker, fucker, better listen up
John's pulling fast behind me, I could hardly give a fuck
Wolf via aux
Blow got my mind fucked up
Murmur another word, I'll merge your fucking face with black truck
Gauge your eyes out then put this golf wang in your fucking stomach
While leaving out some vital information's hard for you to stomach
Johnny turns his brights on, and I'm tryna commute
Back across the border into Canada
And make sure that we Ustream it on camera
Hyped as fuck off of meth-en-'juana-oxy-cotin puffs
From a McGuyvered inhaler rig bought from Mexicans
Rolling, having epileptic shocks from lack of oxygen
Playing Brian Pumper's greatest hits
Crying in agony, bearing off the road
Yelling, ""Bitch why the fuck wouldn't you marry me?""
You promised we'd live happily
No-fucking takesies backsies scouts
Honor ripped the tape and shoved the dick inside her fuckin' mouth..
In and out, when endowed, penis out
Thought this was a front? Welp I guess you know the deal now
I loved you, with all my fucking heart, I'd never hurt you
Bitch you broke our fucking promise and that's fucked up
Remember when you promised me your hand in marriage after school, remember that?
How the fuck you just decide to take it back?
Thus its back to black and frankly I could give a damn where that nigga's at
I'm smoking camel packs this fags on fire, lips around his ...
Glock in hand
Hit a pothole, swerve into a broken van
Sippy sips, got me feeling tippy tip
As we flippy flip down the hill into the black abyss
Johnny's swift pulls up to the sight looking for broken limbs and screaming kids
But there were no remaining carcasses
Around the grounds the leak still hadn't and sparked it
Points the gun in my direction, Yelling, Tells me not to start it
But this awkward social Darwin nigga's like, ""Fuck that, I'm dartin'""
I ain't gettin shot
Tonight I'll bury cock
Even if this faggot thinks he'll kill me with his purple Glock
These unreleased shots of Oxycontin got me feelin' hot
I'm high as fuck..
I'll grab the girl, dodge the bullet, then I'll get the fuck away
And steal this fucker's purple Yukon and call it a fucking day, Piece of cake
But if he actually hits me then I'm fucking screwed
""Kill me, Johnny, kill me""!
But at least do it as I would do:
Lock me in a room with burning gasoline vapors wrapped in tin foil
Next to my wife
And all your neighbors put my hand upon her boobs
Slit my back a ""22""
Paint a ""3"" up on my chest with blood and lead
Carve pyramids in my head
Break both of my fucking legs, tuck my eyes into my pockets of my purple vest
Make her watch me say I love her 'til the second that I'm dead
Play this in your head
Make her watch me say I love her 'til the second that I'm dead
I said..
Play this in your head
Make her watch me say I love her 'til the second that I'm dead
I said..
Play this in your head

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Hold the cold one like he hold a old gun
Like he hold the microphone and stole the show for fun
Or a foe for ransom, flows is handsome
O's in tandem, anthem, random, tantrum
Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry ask the dumb hottie
Masked pump shotty, somebody stop me
Hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy
After rockin' parties he departed in a jalopy
Watch the droptop papi
Known as the grimy limey, slimy— try me
Blimey! Simply smashing in a fashion that's timely
Madvillain dashing in a beat-rhyme crime spree
We rock the house like rock 'n roll
Got more soul than a sock with a hole
Set the stage with a goal
To have the game locked in a cage getting shocked with a pole
Overthrow 'em like throwing Rover a biscuit
A lot of bitches think he's overly chauvinistic
Let go his dick if that's the case
Rats, what a waste there's more cats to chase—
Dogs, he got it like new powers
Woke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours
Sheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club
Had your fam saying, ""Please make me a dub""
Well, since you ask kindly
Where he been behind the mask, who can't find me?
You're blind, in the wine zone, leave your mind blown
When he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone...
Cowboy

[Interlude: MF DOOM]
[Applause]
No no no no enough

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Goony goo goo, loony cuckoo
Like Gary Gnu off New Zoo Revue, but who knew
The mask had a loose screw? Hell, could hardly tell
Had to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell
It speaks well of the hyper base
Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace
Couldn't wait for the snipes to place
At least a track list in bold print typeface
Stopped for a year
Come back with thumb tacks, pop full of beer
We're hip hop sharecroppers
Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers
He's in this for the quiche
You might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche?
Oh, my aching hands
From raking in grands and breaking in mic stands
Villain—his smile stuns ya chick
While he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks
You heard it on the radio, tape it
Play it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit
Raw lyrics—he smells 'em like a hunch
The same intuition that tells him ""spike the punch""
Curses, he's truly the worsest
With enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes
Let the beat blast, she told him wear the mask
He said you bet your sweet ass
It's made of fine chrome alloy
Find him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy

[Interlude]

185,I Go To Pieces,"[Verse 1]
When I see her comin' down the street
I get so shaky and I feel so weak
I tell my eyes look the other way
But they don't seem to hear a word I say

[Chorus]
And I, go to pieces and I wanna hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

[Verse 2]
I tell my arms they'll hold someone new
Another love that will be true
But they don't listen, they don't seem to care
They reach for her but she's not there

[Chorus]
And I, go to pieces and I wanna hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

[Bridge]
I remember what she said when she said
""Goodbye, baby. We'll meet again soon maybe
But until we do, all my best to you""
I'm so lonely, I think about her only

[Verse 3]
I go to places we used to go
But I know she'll never show
She hurt me so much inside
Now I hope she's satisfied

[Chorus]
And I, go to pieces and I wanna hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

Go to pieces and I cry
Every time my baby passes by

186,At Seventeen,"[Verse]
I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone

Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""

And the rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity

Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball

It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown

They call and say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen",Janis Ian,1975,"[69, 43, 28, 21, 7, 3, 3, 4, 7, 9, 16, 20, 23, 25, 32, 39, 55, 66, 77, 87]",20

McCartney was our holy ghost
And we were sure our smiles would never turn to tears
Eighteen caught us pretty fast
Legal to make love at last
Something we'd been playing with for years

Yeah life was great in '65
Made this boy feel so alive
Growing up made something go all wrong
It seemed all the ways of the world
Look away from the thoughts of a pretty girl
Now I wanna go back to catch up in this song

I dont want nothing heavy
Just my baby in the back of my Chevy
Little loving on the weekends make me feel alright
I dont want nothing heavy
Just my baby in the back of my Chevy
To kiss away my blues in the full moon light

So life became an conglomination
Of mamas ways and a woodstock nation
I was so confused no where to turn
And then my lady got so psychodelic
No reasons left to be angelic
Now I wanna kindle the flame that used to burn

I dont want nothing heavy
Just my baby in the back of my Chevy
Little loving on the weekends make me feel alright
I dont want nothing heavy
Just my baby in the back of my Chevy
To kiss away my blues in the full moon light

I dont want nothing heavy
Just my baby in the back of my Chevy
Little loving on the weekends make me feel alright

207,A Friend Of Mine Is Going Blind,"                                        The Evening of the Betrothal

Villefort had, as we have said, hastened back to Madame de Saint-Meran's in the Place du Grand Cours, and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon. Renee was, with all the rest of the company, anxiously awaiting him, and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation.

""Well, Decapitator, Guardian of the State, Royalist, Brutus, what is the matter?"" said one. ""Speak out.""

""Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?"" asked another.

""Has the Corsican ogre broken loose?"" cried a third.

""Marquise,"" said Villefort, approaching his future mother-in-law, ""I request your pardon for thus leaving you. Will the marquis honor me by a few moments' private conversation?""

""Ah, it is really a serious matter, then?"" asked the marquis, remarking the cloud on Villefort's brow.

""So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,"" added he, turning to Renee, ""judge for yourself if it be not important.""

""You are going to leave us?"" cried Renee, unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement.

""Alas,"" returned Villefort, ""I must!""

""Where, then, are you going?"" asked the marquise.

""That, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions for Paris, a friend of mine is going there to-night, and will with pleasure undertake them."" The guests looked at each other.

""You wish to speak to me alone?"" said the marquis.

""Yes, let us go to the library, please."" The marquis took his arm, and they left the salon.

""Well,"" asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, ""tell me what it is?""

""An affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate presence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but
have you any landed property?""

""All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand francs.""

""Then sell out—sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.""

""But how can I sell out here?""

""You have a broker, have you not?""

""Yes.""

""Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an instant's delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.""

""The deuce you say!"" replied the marquis, ""let us lose no time, then!""

And, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell out at the market price.

""Now, then,"" said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, ""I must have another!""

""To whom?""

""To the king.""

""To the king?""

""Yes.""

""I dare not write to his majesty.""

""I do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to do so. I want a letter that will enable me to reach the king's presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would occasion a loss of precious time.""

""But address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of entry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night.""

""Doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him. The keeper would leave me in the background, and take all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget the service I do him.""

""In that case go and get ready. I will call Salvieux and make him write the letter.""

""Be as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an hour.""

""Tell your coachman to stop at the door.""

""You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Renee, whom I leave on such a day with great regret.""

""You will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person.""

""A thousand thanks—and now for the letter.""

The marquis rang, a servant entered.

""Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him.""

""Now, then, go,"" said the marquis.

""I shall be gone only a few moments.""

Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him. It was Mercedes, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come unobserved to inquire after him.

As Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. Dantes had spoken of Mercedes, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty and high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.

""The young man you speak of,"" said Villefort abruptly, ""is a great criminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle."" Mercedes burst into tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.

""But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is alive or dead,"" said she.

""I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,"" replied Villefort.

And desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not thus banished; like Virgil's wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his wound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob, and sank into a chair.

Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The man he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father's faults, appeared to him pale and threatening, leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse, not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death. Then he had a moment's hesitation. He had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort's brow, because they were guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed: in this case he was not the judge, but the executioner.

As he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and which had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill him with vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed, but Villefort's was one of those that never close, or if they do, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment the sweet voice of Renee had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or the fair Mercedes had entered and said, ""In the name of God, I conjure you to restore me my affianced husband,"" his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort's valet, who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.

Villefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head, muttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the carriage, ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-Meran's. The hapless Dantes was doomed.

As the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Renee in waiting. He started when he saw Renee, for he fancied she was again about to plead for Dantes. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she was thinking only of Villefort's departure.

She loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and Renee, far from pleading for Dantes, hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover.

Meanwhile what of Mercedes? She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue de la Loge; she had returned to the Catalans, and had despairingly cast herself on her couch. Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her hand, and covered it with kisses that Mercedes did not even feel. She passed the night thus. The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid no heed to the darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was day. Grief had made her blind to all but one object—that was Edmond.

""Ah, you are there,"" said she, at length, turning towards Fernand.

""I have not quitted you since yesterday,"" returned Fernand sorrowfully.

M. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that Dantes had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and the influential persons of the city; but the report was already in circulation that Dantes was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home in despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done.

Caderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like M. Morrel, to aid Dantes, he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did not succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle—spectres such as Hoffmann strews over his punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.

Danglars alone was content and joyous—he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the Pharaon secure. Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by taking it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires. He went to bed at his usual hour, and slept in peace.

Villefort, after having received M. de Salvieux' letter, embraced Renee, kissed the marquise's hand, and shaken that of the marquis, started for Paris along the Aix road.

Old Dantes was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond. But we know very well what had become of Edmond.","Alexandre Dumas, Père",1975,"[72, 77, 88, 99]",4
208,I Got Stoned And I Missed It,"Oh yes boys play it sweet for me
I was sittin' in my basement I'd just rolled myself a taste of
Somethin' green and gold and glorious to get me through the day
When my friend yells through my transom grab your coat an' get your hat son
There's a nut down on the corner a givin' dollar bills away
But I sat around a bit and then I had another hit
And then I rolled myself a bomber thought about my momma
Looked around fooled around played around while and then
I got stoned and I missed it I got stoned and I missed it
I got stoned and it rolled right by
I got stoned and I missed it I got stoned and I missed it I got stoned oh me oh my
It took seven months of urgin' just to get that local virgin
With the sweet face up to my place to fool around a bit
And next day she woke up rosy and she snuggled up so cosy
But when she asked me how I liked it Lord it hurt me to admit
I got stoned and I missed it...

I ain't makin' no excuses for so many things I uses

(Background sample: Notorious B.I.G.)
[Lie together, cry together, I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together]
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nuttin make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my booty away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

(Chorus) 2X's
Mary J. Blige
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please
Be on another level of planning, of understanding
The bond between man and woman, and child
The highest elevation, cuz we above
All that romance crap, just show your love

211,We Been Singin' Songs,"[Verse 1]
Living in living rooms and it's true
That I haven't gone to bed since the last time that I saw you
'Cause going to couch or going to floor
Well, it doesn't quite provide the eight hours
That my body is screaming for
'Cause we've been drivin' 'round singin' songs about
Drivin' 'round singin' songs
And I don't wanna have fun with anyone but you
So take the Great Ocean Road at midnight
I'll get in at three and meet me in between
Where I am and where I wanna be

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every night's a Saturday night and
Every day's a Monday morning
Everything ever happened the past month and
We didn't get a single warning
And everything that we believe about each other
Has been proven right, it seems
And all we've got left is what the King said

[Chorus]
""Don't fuck with our dreams
Don't fuck with our dreams""

[Verse 2]
I set to wandering like I always say I do
Walked the flat city streets looking for a sign of a past you
And knee-deep in alcohol and borrowed souls
I skipped another sonnet
To open ourselves up to the hope and road
And as the dry wheat fields fly by ready to burn
In the overtaking lane, I take a second to learn
From the mangled advice I was given last night
By the sweaty guys with the glassy eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And every night's a Saturday night and
Every day's a Monday morning
Everything ever happened the past month and
We didn't get a single warning
And everything that we believe about each other
Has been proven right, it seems
And all we've got left is what the King said

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with our dreams
Don't fuck with our dreams
Don't fuck with our dreams
Don't fuck with our dreams

[Verse 3]
I wanna leave something permanent on this stretch of road
Something that won't fly away
Like the dust and the exhaust smoke we breathe in
To strengthen the low
Like when you said
""If I'm gonna die, at least I died helping someone""
That's what you were thinking while you held together your arm
I can't take another late night phone call
From some other far-from-home hospital
I came so close to giving up
Why has my way of coping become a reason to spill blood?
But now isn't the time for backing down
Got our feet so firm on the ground

[Verse 4]
So call me what you will, I don't care
I know what happened, I was there
We know what happened, we were there
Yeah, call me what you will, I don't care
I know what happened, I was there
We know what happened, we were there
I know what happened, I was there
We know what happened, we were there
I know what happened, I was there
We know what happened, we were there

[Pre-Chorus]
And every night's a Saturday night and
Every day's a Monday morning
Everything ever happened the past month and
We didn't get a single warning
Everything that we believe about each other
Has been proven right, it seems
And all we've got left is what the King said

[Chorus]
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another ""welcome back""
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing

Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it

Only you can tell it
Tell me why

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Two sides, what the game'll do
Bring money, fame to you
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high
Standin' on it like a pedestal
Couldn't imagine a better view
From the poolhouse you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, one ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
Eghck! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
Now that there said somethin', don't make me have to dead nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'

[Chorus]
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another ""welcome back""
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why

[Verse 2: Wale]
Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
My eyes low, I keep 5 rolled so my THC be makin' sound effects
We ain't hatin', cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Shoutout to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas ride
That's right, what up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
Tell these motherfuckers get me doe
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store
And remove your words, G double O-D, MMG we good
Got Zamunda furs, don't know how Akeem, but Pusha's semi cold
My nigga Geezy out in VA, I hope you hear these flows
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know

It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing

221,Party Music,"What it do derrty, I see you playing the walls, you out here beefing with out beats and you keep playing us soft
Claiming that you need something to make you move like evictions, and if you moving to this beat then ain't no way that it's Christian
But derrty, we understand that sin is much more appealing, that's why fellas run to girls with clothes that's much more revealing
But I bet you if this song was about clicking and clacking or grills, you'd have no problem putting a dip in your back and that's real
See the problem ain't the track or the groove, retracting your moves, perhaps this world's attractive to you
And you're in love with the feeling from the records they spinning, but the issue is you love it to the point that you sinning
It's unfulfilling I promise when your party is done a part of you longs for at least another part of the fun
Uh-oh, you don't wanna be found in that position, especially a Christian (a Christian?) compromising your living

They don't want that godly music but naughty music
That party music
That make you shake your body music
And you ain't gotta leave the church to find music
That will put in work

Man I came from the club scene house parties, block parties, OG's hit the liquor store and cop 40s
Covered up with them brown paper bags, raw jeans pulled down make 'em sag
Silver chain used to say it was white gold, rap music made me cooler than ice cold
Until my life froze and the good news of Christ interrupted like them commercials from Geico
And like Nitro, I quickly got rid of my Biggy and 2Pac that made me feel like I was psycho
Said to myself, guess for me that rap's dead, started feening for them 808's like a crack head
All I needed was a window and a rope for suicide, but God provided the antidote
Raw beats and some Godly music, only problem now is that we hardly use it

They don't want that godly music but naughty music
That party music
That make you shake your body music
And you ain't gotta leave the church to find music

222,Third Rate Romance,"Sitting at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant
She was staring at her coffee cup
He was trying to keep his courage up by applying booze
Talk was small when they talked at all, they both knew what they wanted
There was no need to talk about it
They were old enough to scope it out and keep it loose

She said, you don't look like my type, but I guess you'll do

He said, I'll even tell you that I love you, if you want me too
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous

When they left the bar, they got in his car and they drove away
He drove to the family inn
She didn't even have to pretend she didn't know what for
Then he went to the desk and made his request while she waited outside
And he came back with the key
And she said, give it to me and I'll unlock the door

She kept saying, I've never really done this kind of thing before, have you

Wish I knew what was going wrong
Seems so very long since we laughed together
It's no good to be all alone
When you hurt a friend
And you both feel empty

What I'd give to erase the pain
Will we ever make friends?
Is it over or shall we try again?
For a brand new love affair

We are both afraid
That our love may fade and we just won't make it
Maybe soon we'll be friends again
Find ourselves and then
Really make it happen

Start all over again
And do it up the right way
Come together my friend
And celebrate the new day

Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive

And I got more money
Then a horse has hairs
Cause my rich old uncle died
And answered all my prayers!
Having all this money
Is going to bring me down
If you ain't with me honey
To help me spread it around!

I don't mind if you love me for my money
If you love me for whatever else I got
But 'cept for all this stuff
I'm a lonely Fort Knox
I don't guess I'm doing all that hot

245,Please Mr. Please,"In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox
With the best of country music, old and new
You can hear your five selections for a quarter
And somebody else's songs when your's are through

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter
And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am, just missing you again

Please, mister, please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please, mister, please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again

If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee

But I guess I'd better get myself together
Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said, ""I'm sorry"", by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind

Please, mister, please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please, mister, please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again",Olivia Newton-John,1975,"[59, 37, 31, 10, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 34, 46, 65]",15

I want to live that age old dream
Come on lads we can go together
Let's take the best right now
Take the best right now
I wanna go to an old ho-down
Long ago in a western town
Pick me up but my feet are dragging
Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon

Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine

Anything that Heaven can give you, I can give you instead

I love you though the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea
And I really only want you to want me

Is the only way that I can explain

Now that you've shown your heart
I'll be right with you baby, I'll never leave you alone
Anywhere you want me to be honey, I'll be there to have and to hold

And now that the clouds roll back, hold on to me baby
We're going never to land, flying on the power of love

I love you, though time may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you, till the very same come back to the land

Yeah, I should've screamed, but nobody listened
So I passed out with the blood drippin'
In this glass house, feeling like a prison
Me and death keep tongue-kissin'
I just fell out with my lil' bro, the life getting to us
The drink getting to us, the drugs getting to us
This highway to hell and everybody knew it

I forgot my ice-milk home, quilted
Whiteness, vague, recalled
Shapes of celestial aldermen.
My doubled eyes flew open.
Here I learned to cope and–
Like the frog hunched in the pond
Whose half-immersed, wandering
Eyes see below a green and misty realm
And, above, the vaulting elms
Clear as the sound of rat-tat-tatting
Woodpeckers–saw this and that! Ingrown
Sleep ceased.
The beast
Of the forest snuffling,
Ruffling
His back hairs
At the foot of the spiral stairs
Lifted his muzzy snout
And let out
A snort, a roar,
And wept like the River Jordan.
And I walked amidst men,
Men of the clouds, at attention,
Ram-rod
Stiff, hosanna-ing God,
And men of the wadis and deltas,
Of the Congo of hell, tussling
Husked boars, men of the silver-skinned
Coast, of the eye-tearing wind.
And all that remained
Was, with these stained

Hands, to be kind,
To mind
My P’s and Q’s,
To recuse
Myself from all conflicted
Interests, and interdicted
Judgements.
I had to budge. Tents
That I had set up
Were assaulted by the wind without let-up,
And the keen
Cold cleanness
Prickles in my skin and nerves,
Swerves, trickles, in a trice,
An icicle rivulet
Down my spine,
And I give you this old wine,
Which burns and warms, inside,
The lazing lion’s pride.",Yacov david,1975,"[92, 92, 95, 97]",4

The birth of a gangster

Alvin wasn't out of knee pants good
Before he was running wild
As far as we could see back
He was always a problem child

They said Alvin was born and raised
He was raised from a bad, bad seed
One more? in this ghetto
Is the one thing that we don't need

Talking 'bout Alvin Stone

Graduated from the boy in the street
To the man behind the gun
Ordered people all around
With a dirty look for everyone

But tell me, why do women
Throw themselves at you, Alvin

They see that cool cold cluster of
Diamond rings shining on every hand

But tell me, what good
Is it gonna do you, Alvin

You've become rich overnight
Dealing in heroin

To never have had a friend, ha

257,If You Think You Know How To Love Me,"A breathless drive on a downtown street
Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run, though we run it still burned our eyes

Oh, yes we can walk on the wild, wild side of life
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise, you can take my hand
And show me the way to understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

Yes, if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

A reckless night in a nameless town
And we moved out of sight, with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe

Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me
But there's a lot I can learn, and a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hands
It's up to you to make me understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way",Chris Norman,1975,"[96, 96, 98]",3

259,Rendezvous,"[Part 1]
Ich hab' gehört, dass du vergeben bist
Ich wollt's nicht glauben, weil man Menschen so wie dich nur einmal in sei'm Leben trifft
Du warst das Mädchen, das so schüchtern in den Zug reinkam
Standest zu einsam vor dem Schuleingang
Jeden Tag, bist nachts aufgeblieben
Wurden Freunde, hatten Ziele, doch aus Freundschaft wurde Liebe
Kennst du noch unsern geheim'n Weg? Ich mein' dein'n Heimweg
Wenn ich heute dran denke, tut mir diese Zeit weh
Uns war es nicht peinlich, doch trafen uns heimlich
Habe dir versprochen, dass du nie wieder allein bist
Ich schwöre, Schatz, ich bereue es jeden Tag
Als ich von dir ging und deine Tränen sah
Ich schick' mich zurück in die Vergangenheit
Und ich schwör's dir, dass ich bis zum Tod mit dir zusammen bleib'
Ist dir dieser Song genug?
Ich beweis' es dir, nur noch ein Rendezvous

[Hook]
Schenk mir nur noch ein Rendezvous!
Und ich deck' dich wie ein Engel mit den Wolken zu
Ich hab' so oft versucht, so oft versucht
Ich geb' mir selbst die Schuld, vielleicht war es nicht oft genug
Schenk mir nur noch ein Rendezvous!
Und ich deck' dich wie ein Engel mit den Wolken zu
Du bist ein Engel, den Gott erschuf
Ich kann dich nicht vergessen, ich hab' es oft versucht

[Part 2]
Heute würd' ich gerne mit dir sein
Alles, was ich habe, mit dir teil'n
Man sagt, dass Liebe schwach macht
Doch ich werde weiter nach dir suchen, selbst wenn ich keine Kraft hab'
Bin an unserm Ort, falls dir etwas Sorgen macht
An dem Ort, wo ich dich gefunden und verloren hab'
Ich wollte eigentlich nur fair sein
Der Mann, der mit dir Sterne zählt – sollte ich nicht der sein?
Mein letzter Wunsch: Nur noch einmal mit dir abends reden
In den Arm nehmen und dann schlafen legen
Ich hab' immer einen Platz in meinem Herz für dich
Ganz egal, wie weit entfernt du bist
Ich schließe meine Augen und träum' von der Vergangenheit
Als ich dich gefragt hab': „Willst du mit mir zusamm'n sein?“
Ist dir dieser Song genug?
Ich beweis' es dir, nur noch ein Rendezvous

[Hook]
Schenk mir nur noch ein Rendezvous!
Und ich deck' dich wie ein Engel mit den Wolken zu
Ich hab' so oft versucht, so oft versucht
Ich geb' mir selbst die Schuld, vielleicht war es nicht oft genug
Schenk mir nur noch ein Rendezvous!
Und ich deck' dich wie ein Engel mit den Wolken zu
Du bist ein Engel, den Gott erschuf
Ich kann dich nicht vergessen, ich hab' es oft versucht

[Part 3]
Vielleicht tut das wieder weh, wenn ich dich wiederseh'
Wie dein letztes „Auf Wiederseh'n!“
Du hast mich angeschaut – ich hab' weggeseh'n
Ich konnt' es nicht, denn das waren echte Trän'n
Bin von dir gegang'n, doch ich hab' es nicht zurückgeschafft
Ich weiß es nicht, vielleicht hab' ich mein Glück verpasst
Du bist der Grund, warum ich bis heute einsam blieb
Denn ich glaube dran, dass man nur einmal liebt

[Hook]
Schenk mir nur noch ein Rendezvous!
Und ich deck' dich wie ein Engel mit den Wolken zu
Ich hab' so oft versucht, so oft versucht
Ich geb' mir selbst die Schuld, vielleicht war es nicht oft genug
Schenk mir nur noch ein Rendezvous!

Du bist ein Engel, den Gott erschuf

I'm willin' to give you
More than I take
If it takes all night
I'm willin' to make...

Make good love to you
And bring you pleasure
The kind of love
That you can treasure

You've spoken of love
I know you've tasted it
But without the rest of it
Life can be wasted

Ahhh, take it baby
Take it baby
Come take all that I got

Ahhh, take it baby
Take it baby
You can have all I got

A mouth full of love
Is all you've tasted
Without the rest of it
Life can be wasted

Come get the best that I got
And I'll belong to you

Come get the cream off the top
Come get the best that I got
And your dreams'll come true...

271,Send In The Clowns,"[Verse 1]
Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air

Send in the clowns

[Verse 2]
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move

Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

[Verse 3]
Just when I stopped
Opening doors
Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours

Making my entrance again
With my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

[Verse 4]
Don't you love a farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear

But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Don't bother
They're here

[Verse 5]
Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
In my career

Where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns

There you are
Standing there reaching out for me
Something warm in your eyes
Touched my heart

Made my lonely life a paradise
It came today

Ooh, look in my eyes and see how much I want ya
Feel my touch

I feel it in my heart
You’ve been leaving notes unsigned
Leaving out sweetheart
We used to have a warm breakfast table
Time to sit and talk to you
Now I face the morning paper
Won’t you look at me
Tell baby what’s new

(Chorus)
I can’t live in a house of strangers baby
Can’t we talk to each other
I can’t live in a house of strangers darling
As one friend to another
Don’t come home just for sleeping
Times are bad but talk is cheaper
I can’t live in a house of strangers baby

Where’s that famous loving smile
Where’s my funny clown
I had you with me for awhile
Thought you’d stick around
You were always good conversation
Now it seems there’s nothing to say
What’s the latest news in the nation
And where’s my man
Why did he go away

And that's a long long time
And if by chance that I do
Would you be gone?
If you speak to me in Latin
As a cloud that appears in spring
Undulatus asperatus has such a charming ring
And it was raining like a movie
And it was hard to look away
And as we spoke to one another
We held our gaze

There's much more calm of nostalgia
But it's not just up to me
And some strong feats of strength
Could be all there was to see
And should there ever be a question
If we will leave this place or when
It just goes without saying
We'll never work in this town again
And we'll have sunshine
Filtered through the faces of the fog
And I fell so very hard for you
And we'll have sunshine
Filtered through the faces of the fog
And I could not find that article on you

It was raining like a movie
And it was hard to look away
And we shrugged to one another
And we held our gaze

It was talk of love in Tennessee
Of the beauty of the seventies
And I had some people on the graveled road
We were out there in the fine place
And I turned my head out to the crowd
You could almost sense their glory
And if you took just a few more steps
You could join them in the hustle
Do the hustle, do the hustle
Do the hustle, do the hustle

I can see the future in the air
With you sleeping in the morning
And if all our efforts lead to this
And how it barely slipped away

But soon the night will bring the pains

286,It Doesn't Matter Anymore/When Will I Be Loved,"EPISODE 2 - DARK WINGS, DARK WORDS
EXT: THE WOODS OUTSIDE WINTERFELL

BRAN STARK runs through the woods, holding a bow. He stops, eyes searching. He turns to move again, but a raven startles him as it swoops past his face and alights in a tree. BRAN steps closer, notches an arrow and takes aim.

JON: Don't think too much, Bran.

Suddenly, JON SNOW and ROBB STARK are by his side.

JON: Relax your bow arm.

BRAN carefully lets the arrow fly. It misses and the raven takes flight. JON and ROBB laugh.

NED STARK: (O.S.) And which one of you was a marksman at ten?

BRAN looks to the sky, trying to locate his father's voice.

BRAN: Father?

JOJEN REED appears next to him.

JOJEN: You can't kill it, you know.

BRAN: Why not?

JOJEN:  Because the raven is you.

EXT: A FIELD IN THE NORTH

BRAN wakes suddenly and sits up. He was sleeping atop furs in an open tent. RICKON STARK, in the cart nearby, is startled awake by BRAN's movements. Their direwolves, SUMMER and SHAGGYDOG, stand near them. HODOR leans down to check on BRAN while OSHA sits nearby, sharpening sharpens a stick.

HODOR: Hodor.

BRAN: It's all right, Hodor.

HODOR: Hodor.

OSHA: Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?

BRAN: No, it was the three-eyed raven.

OSHA: He's back.

BRAN: I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy.

OSHA: I don't want to hear about it.

BRAN: But you asked.

OSHA: We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.

BRAN: I didn't ask for black magic dreams.

OSHA: I know you didn't, little lord.

Birds screech in the distance. OSHA looks up, concerned at their disturbance.

OSHA: We need to move.

She stands and puts away her knife.

BRAN: We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.

OSHA: And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?

BRAN: No.

OSHA: Some good he is, then.

OSHA begins to pack up camp.

OSHA: I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.

INT: HARRENHAL CHAMBER

ROBB looks pensively into a fire. TALISA stands nearby.

TALISA: My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.

TALISA walks over to ROBB and half-embraces him

ROBB: Did you ever think you'd marry one?

TALISA: I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.

ROBB: Never?

TALISA: Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.

They kiss. The chamber door opens and ROOSE BOLTON enters.

ROOSE BOLTON: Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen.

TALISA: Lord Bolton.

ROOSE BOLTON holds two raven messages, one in each hand.

ROBB: Let me guess which one is the good news.

ROOSE BOLTON: Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.

EXT: HARRENHAL COURTYARD

ROBB stands and CATELYN STARK sits in an archway. CATELYN is dejected.

CATELYN: I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.

ROBB: We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.

CATELYN: Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?

ROBB does not answer.

CATELYN: Something else?

ROBB: By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.

CATELYN: Have you received any demands?

ROBB: No.

CATELYN: Have you heard anything from Theon at all?

INT: DUNGEON

THEON is bound on an X-shaped cross in a dungeon. Someone drenches him with a bucket of water to wake him. He wakes, shaking, and takes stock of his location. A blurry TORTURER looks on.

THEON: Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?

The TORTURER approaches and grabs THEON's hand, roughly.

TORTURER: I want to do this.

The TORTURER thrusts an awl under THEON's finger nail. THEON screams in pain.

EXT: A FIELD IN THE RIVERLANDS

SER JAIME LANNISTER and LADY BRIENNE OF TARTH make their way through a hedge. JAIME's hands are bound and BRIENNE has him leashed.

JAIME: Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?

BRIENNE: Yes.

They walk through the field. BRIENNE occasionally pushes JAIME forward.

JAIME: So how shall we pass the time?

BRIENNE: By putting one foot in front of the other.

JAIME: It's going to be a very dull walk.

BRIENNE: I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.

JAIME: You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.

BRIENNE: If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman.

JAIME: All the good it's done her.

EXT: RIVERLANDS FOREST, LATER

JAIME relieves himself on a tree, while BRIENNE looks on.

JAIME: How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.

BRIENNE: Not your concern, Kingslayer.

JAIME: It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.

BRIENNE: How would you know?

JAIME: Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.

She yanks on his leash and they move on.

BRIENNE: Move.

JAIME: Were you pledged to Stannis?

BRIENNE: Gods, no.

JAIME: Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.

BRIENNE: Shut your mouth.

JAIME: Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you.

BRIENNE: I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king.

JAIME: Sounds like you quite fancied him.

BRIENNE: I did not fancy him.

JAIME: Oh, gods, you did.

JAIME: Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.

BRIENNE yanks on his leash in response.

JAIME: He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.

BRIENNE: I'm not interested in foul rumors.

JAIME: Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.

BRIENNE grabs the back of JAIME's head and yanks roughly. She puts her face directly in his.

BRIENNE: Shut your mouth!

JAIME: I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love.

A man approaches, leading a horse.

MAN: Where are you headed, then?

BRIENNE: South. You?

MAN: Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win.

JAIME: No, you really can't.

They both laugh, kindly.

MAN: Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you.

BRIENNE: And you.

The man starts to walk away, but looks back over his shoulder.

JAIME: He knows who I am.

BRIENNE: He doesn't.

JAIME: Maybe you're right.  But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?

BRIENNE: We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.

JAIME: More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?

BRIENNE pushes JAIME forward, and leads him further along in the woods.

INT: KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS

KING JOFFREY BARATHEON is being fitted by a TAILOR. QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER, seated nearby, looks on.

JOFFREY:  Make it tighter here.

CERSEI: That's better. It makes you look very strong.

The TAILOR lays some sample fabric on JOFFREY's shoulder. Displeased, JOFFREY snatches it away.

JOFFREY: No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.

JOFFREY dismisses the TAILOR.

TAILOR: Yes, Your Grace.

The TAILOR exits.

JOFFREY: Bloody flowers. On the king.

CERSEI: Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.

JOFFREY tosses the fabric away and moves to his bed to change back into his clothes.

CERSEI: Tell me what you think of her.

JOFFREY: Who?

CERSEI: Margaery.

JOFFREY: She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.

CERSEI: It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.

JOFFREY: Yes, she is.

CERSEI: Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.

JOFFREY: Not to me.

CERSEI: I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.

JOFFREY: This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.

CERSEI stands.

CERSEI: Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.

JOFFREY: She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.

CERSEI reaches out to him, but JOFFREY pushes her hand away.

CERSEI: You need to ask yourself

JOFFREY: I don't need to do anything.

The TAILOR returns with a different fabric sample. He drapes it on JOFFREY's shoulder.

JOFFREY: Better. Much better.

INT: KING'S LANDING, SANSA'S CHAMBERS

SHAE brushes SANSA STARK's hair as SANSA sits before a mirror.

SHAE: I still don't believe it.

SANSA: He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.

SHAE: Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.

SANSA: Littlefinger's not in love with me.

SHAE helps SANSA into her dress.

SHAE: Love is not the thing he wants.

SANSA: He's too old.

SHAE: They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?

SANSA: No.

SHAE: If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.

SANSA: Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.

There is a knock on the door.

GUARD: Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.

SANSA: Send him in.

SHAE opens the door and SER LORAS TYRELL enters.

LORAS: Lady Sansa.

SANSA: Ser Loras.

LORAS: My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?

SANSA exits with LORAS, while SHAE watches with concern.

EXT: KING'S LANDING GARDENS

SANSA and LORAS stroll together through the garden, her arm in his.

LORAS:  I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.

SANSA: You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose.

LORAS: Of course I did.

They approach LADY MARGAERY TYRELL.

MARGAERY: (to a maid) It's more your color. You take it.

MAID: Thank you.

MARGAERY: (to LORAS) You're such a dear.

LORAS: I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.

SANSA: Thank you, Ser Loras.

LORAS exits. MARGAERY leads SANSA to a patio, filled with maids.

MARGAERY: Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.

They walk to LADY OLENNA, who is seated in the patio.

OLENNA: Kiss me, child.

OLENNA extends her hand and SANSA kisses it in greeting.

OLENNA: It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.

SANSA: And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant.

OLENNA: Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.

MARGAERY: Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras.

OLENNA: Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-

MARGAERY: Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?

OLENNA: She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?

SANSA: Lemon cake's my favorite.

OLENNA: So we've been told. (To the servant) Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others.

They move to a table away from the others.

OLENNA: Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?

SANSA: I haven't had the pleasure.

OLENNA: No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.

SANSA: I-, I-

OLENNA: You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?

SANSA looks down and doesn't reply.

OLENNA: Has he ripped out your tongue?

SANSA:  Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion

OLENNA: Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?

MARGAERY:  I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.

A SERVANT approaches and brings a platter.

OLENNA: Bring me some cheese.

SERVANT: The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.

OLENNA: The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.

The SERVANT nods and exits quickly.

OLENNA: Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.

SANSA: My father always told the truth.

OLENNA: Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head.

SANSA: Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.

SANSA holds back tears.

OLENNA: Go on.

SANSA regains her composure.

SANSA: I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.

MARGAERY: She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her.

OLENNA: Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.

SANSA: He's a monster.

OLENNA: Ah. That's a pity.

SANSA: Please, don't stop the wedding.

OLENNA: Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese.

The SERVANT sets down the tray and slips away. SANSA sighs in resignation.

EXT: RIVERLANDS WOODS

ROBB's forces move along a path through the woods. The direwolf GREY WIND watches as RICKARD KARSTARK and ROBB watch the men march past.

RICKARD KARSTARK: We're at war. This march is a distraction.

ROBB: My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.

RICKARD KARSTARK: Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?

ROBB: No.

RICKARD KARSTARK: Then it's a distraction.

ROBB: My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.

RICKARD KARSTARK: Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference.

ROBB: Have you lost faith in our cause?

RICKARD KARSTARK:  If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.

ROBB: If you no longer believe-

RICKARD KARSTARK: I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.

ROBB: You don't think we can win?

RICKARD KARSTARK:  May I speak my mind, Your Grace?

ROBB:  Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?

RICKARD KARSTARK:  I think you lost this war the day you married her.

TALISA rides past.

EXT: RIVERLANDS WOODS, FURTHER UP THE PATH

CATELYN weaves a wooden circle bound with twine. TALISA rides up and dismounts with the help of a soldier, her mount whinnying.

TALISA: Whoa, whoa.

MAN: Your Grace.

CATELYN: You're afraid of her. And she knows it.

TALISA: I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?

CATELYN: No.

TALISA: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-

CATELYN: You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.

TALISA: You've made them before?

TALISA sits.

CATELYN: Twice.

TALISA: Did they work?

CATELYN: After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.

TALISA: (Nods)

CATELYN: Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.

TALISA: Which boy?

CATELYN: Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.

TALISA: And he lived.

CATELYN: And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.

EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL

The wildlings march through the mountains. JON and MANCE RAYDER stop to talk.

MANCE: Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?

JON: Yes.

MANCE: You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people.

JON: I understand.

MANCE: Well, how could you understand?

JON:  You want to protect your people.

MANCE: Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?

JON: No.

MANCE: I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.

MANCE starts walking again.

CUT TO: A CRAG NEXT TO THE MARCHING FORCES

MANCE and JON join TORMUND GIANTSBANE, YGRITTE, and ORREL. ORREL sits, eyes white, looking up to a raven.

TORMUND: Shouldn't be long now.

JON: What's wrong with him?

MANCE: He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us.

YGRITTE: What, you've never met a warg?

The raven continues to circle overhead.

MANCE: Orell.

ORELL returns to consciousness.

MANCE: Where were you this time?

ORELL:  The Fist of the First Men.

MANCE: What did you see?

ORELL: Dead crows.

EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL

The Night's Watch march through the snow covered mountains, looking exhausted.

RAST: What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to.

RAST moves ahead. SAMWELL TARLY is drained. He falls to his knees. RAST looks back, satisfied. Then GRENN notices that SAM has given up. GRENN and DOLOROUS EDDISON TOLLETT walk back to him.

GRENN: Hey. Get up, Sam.

SAM: No.

GRENN: Get up.

SAM: I can't.

GRENN: If you stop, you'll die.

DOLOROUS EDD: 'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too.

SAM: You don't care.

DOLOROUS EDD: 'Course we care.

SAM: You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me.

DOLOROUS EDD: Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die.

GRENN: Help me get him up.

GRENN and DOLOROUS EDD try to help SAM to his feet. RAST comes back to the trio.

RAST: Looks like that piggy is done for.

GRENN: Help us get him up.

RAST: He's slowing us down.

GRENN: Just get him up!

RAST:  Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.

LORD COMMANDER JEOR MORMONT comes back to see what is happening.

JEOR: What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?

GRENN:  Aye, I think so.

RAST: If he can't, we may as well just go without him.

JEOR: That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?

SAM: (nods)

RAST: Why should the rest of us-

JEOR: Rast, you're responsible for him.

RAST: What am I supposed to do?

JEOR: Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!

JEOR exits. SAM starts to follow, dazed and exhausted.

RAST:  I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?

They all walk on.

EXT: WOODS IN THE NORTH

BRAN lies sleeping on some furs. A branch snaps in the distance and he wakes with a start. OSHA and SUMMER are hunched and alert. OSHA has her makeshift spear at the ready.

BRAN: Where's Rickon and Hodor?

OSHA: Looking for food.

BRAN: What's out there?

OSHA creeps forward and then runs into the woods. SUMMER growls. A young figure approaches. He looks curiously at BRAN. SUMMER growls more fiercely. From behind him, OSHA places her spearpoint on JOJEN's neck.

OSHA:  Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood.

JOJEN: I'm unarmed.

OSHA: That was poor planning.

JOJEN: My sister carries the weapons.

MEERA REED appears quietly, slipping a knife to OSHA's throat and creating a stand-off.

MEERA: I'm better with them. Drop the spear.

OSHA doesn't comply.

MEERA: Drop it.

OSHA releases the spear.

OSHA: If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.

SUMMER continues to growl in warning. JOJEN approaches the direwolf.

JOJEN: You must be SUMMER.

SUMMER immediately stops growling. JOJEN holds out his hand. SUMMER sniffs it, and is pleased. The direwolf walks away. JOJEN approaches BRAN.

JOJEN: I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go.

EXT: RIVERLANDS WOODS

GENDRY, ARYA STARK, and HOT PIE walk through the woods, weapons drawn.

GENDRY: I'm just trying to understand.

ARYA: Would you please shut up about it?

GENDRY: Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.

ARYA: I'm not listening.

GENDRY: But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.

ARYA: Shut up.

GENDRY: You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

ARYA: Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?

GENDRY: But you could have ended the war.

ARYA: Where are we going?

GENDRY: North.

They pause in the woods.

ARYA: If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.

GENDRY: Maybe we already passed it.

ARYA: It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us.

They hear some far-away singing.

GENDRY: Could be a minstrel.

ARYA: Shut up.

THOROS: A lion still has claws...

HOT PIE:  A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food.

ARYA: Shh.

They crouch to hide behind a broken wall, and watch a handful of men approach. One is singing.

THOROS: And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That Lord of Castamere
But now the rains
Weep o'er his hall
With no one there to hear.

An arrow whistles past the trio, surprising them. It embeds in a tree trunk behind them. They spin to hide out of sight.

THOROS: What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?

ANGUY:  Just a dirty little cub, I think.

THOROS: Loose a few more shafts.

ARYA steps out of hiding.

ARYA: Don't.

THOROS and ANGUY look down at her from the path. THOROS takes a deep drink.

THOROS: Put the sword down, girl.

ARYA: You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.

ANGUY: Generous.

THOROS: You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?

ARYA: What friends?

ANGUY:  The fat to your left and the lad beside him.

Resigned, GENDRY steps out and pulls HOT PIE with him. They ready their weapons. THOROS responds, and his party swiftly comes over the wall to face the trio. They do not draw weapons.

THOROS: Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?

ARYA: Who are you?

THOROS: Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.

ARYA: No, who do you fight for?

THOROS:  The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.

HOT PIE: I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.

THOROS: You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way.

HOT PIE takes a few steps back. ANGUY notches an arrow in response. ARYA, GENDRY, and HOT PIE raise their weapons, nervously.

ANGUY: Here's the thing, fat

ANGUY shoots the arrow into the sky.

ANGUY: When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking.

HOT PIE lurches forward two steps. The arrow lands, burying itself where HOT PIE was just standing. THOROS motions for the trio to move with them. Some men chuckle, and then everyone scrambles over the broken wall in turn.

ANGUY: Half the country's starving and look at this one.

THOROS: Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.

THOROS follows HOT PIE. ANGUY pulls his arrow from the tree trunk.

INT: KING'S LANDING, TYRION'S CHAMBERS

TYRION returns to his quarters. SHAE lies waiting for him.

SHAE: My lion.

TYRION: We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.

They kiss.

SHAE: But you said I should come to you with any problems.

TYRION: Did anyone see you? No.

SHAE: No.

TYRION: You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.

They kiss again.

TYRION: All right. What is this problem?

SHAE:  I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.

TYRION: Baelish doesn't have friends.

SHAE: I don't know her name.

TYRION: Oh, Ros? The redhead?

SHAE: How do you know her?

TYRION: I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.

SHAE: She's a whore.

TYRION: Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.

SHAE: You fucked her.

TYRION: Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice.

SHAE slaps at his chest, playful, and stands up to walk from the bed to pout.

TYRION: But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.

SHAE: And was she good? Did you like her?

TYRION: Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?

SHAE: That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

TYRION: Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?

SHAE: We have to protect her.

SHAE begins to pet him with affection.

TYRION: We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.

SHAE pushes him again.

SHAE: A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?

TYRION: Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.

SHAE: You pervert. You want her? This child?

TYRION:  I don't even want to talk about her.

SHAE: But you are.

TYRION: Only because you're making me.

SHAE grabs his chin and looks directly at him.

SHAE: I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.

TYRION: This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.

SHAE: Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me.

TYRION: Hmm, yes.

They kiss.

SHAE: Now do you think I'm cruel?

She begins to undress him.

TYRION: Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.

She kisses him, loosens his clothEs, and kisses him lower.

TYRION: Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.

EXT: KING'S LANDING COURTYARD

MARGAERY walks through the courtyard, accompanied by guards.

INT: KING'S LANDING, JOFFREY'S CHAMBERS

JOFFREY sits holding his crossbow. A guard knocks on the door.

GUARD: Lady Tyrell, my king.

JOFFREY: Send her in.

The door opens, and MARGAERY enters.

MARGAERY: You wanted to see me, Your Grace?

JOFFREY: I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.

MARGAERY: That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want.

JOFFREY: Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.

She approaches.

MARGAERY: A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.

JOFFREY: And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?

MARGAERY: Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.

JOFFREY: What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?

MARGAERY: The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.

JOFFREY: You failed to do this.

MARGAERY: Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.

JOFFREY: You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?

MARGAERY: No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.

JOFFREY: What makes you say this?

MARGAERY sits next to JOFFREY.

MARGAERY: Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me.

JOFFREY: No, he was a known degenerate.

MARGAERY: It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.

JOFFREY: Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.

MARGAERY: As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.

MARGAERY strokes the crossbow.

MARGAERY: You are the king.

JOFFREY: Yes. I am.

JOFFREY looks at his crossbow, a bit excited.

JOFFREY: Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

MARGAERY: It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?

JOFFREY:  It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.

JOFFREY uses the lever to cock the bow.

JOFFREY: The bolt goes here.

MARGAERY hands him the bolt, daintily. He takes it and arms the bow. He stands, weapon braced at his waist, and looks for a target.

JOFFREY: And then you just aim and-

JOFFREY releases the bolt and pierces the head of a stuffed boar. MARGAERY erupts in applause and laughs. She stands.

MARGAERY: Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman.

JOFFREY: It's not unheard of.

MARGAERY: My father would never let me before-

JOFFREY: You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?

MARGAERY:  May I? Please.

JOFFREY hands her the crossbow, and helps MARGAERY into a proper stance. They stand, posed and close.

MARGAERY: I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.

JOFFREY: Could you do it? Could you kill something?.

MARGAERY:  I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?

JOFFREY: Yes.

MARGAERY: Would you like to watch me?

JOFFREY: Yes.

INT: DUNGEON

THEON screams as the TORTURER's ASSISTANT turns a huge screw that is planted on his foot.

THEON: Stop! Stop!

TORTURER: Tell us the truth.

THEON: (screaming) About what?

The ASSISTANT turns the screw again.

THEON: I don't know what you want.

TORTURER: I want the truth.

THEON: What truth?

TORTURER: Why'd you take Winterfell?

THEON: I took it to-I took it-

TORTURER: Who gave the orders?

THEON: No one. I took it on my own.

TORTURER: Why?

THEON: To take the North while it was vulnerable.

TORTURER: What were you going to do once you took it?

THEON: Hold it. Rule it.

TORTURER: Good. That's very good.

The ASSISTANT turns the screw again. Blood well ups around it as THEON screams.

THEON: Why did you do that?

TORTURER:  I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?

THEON:  I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.

The TORTURER approaches.

THEON: (panicking) Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.

The TORTURER steps even closer.

THEON: What are you doing?

The TORTURER places a hood over THEON's head.

THEON: Please.

The ASSISTANT turns the screw and THEON screams. The TORTURER walks away, followed by his team. They leave one lowly cleaning boy, RAMSAY, behind.

THEON: I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off.

The door closes shut. RAMSAY removes the hood from THEON. He is surprised.

RAMSAY: Your sister sent me.

THEON: Yara?

RAMSAY releases the pressure on his foot.

RAMSAY: I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.

RAMSAY places the hood back onto THEON's head and leaves.

THEON: No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go.

EXT: THE NORTH

HODOR, RICKON, OSHA, JOJEN, and MEERA walk along a narrow road. HODOR pulls the cart carrying BRAN. The direwolves are nearby. RICKON runs excitedly down the hill.

OSHA: Rickon, stay with us.

BRAN: It's all right. The wolves will protect him.

BRAN nods to SUMMER, who turns to follow RICKON. They continue on the path.

JOJEN: You can get inside his head, see through his eyes.

BRAN: Only when I'm asleep.

JOJEN: That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.

BRAN: It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-

JOJEN: A three-eyed raven?

BRAN: You've seen it?

JOJEN:  We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?

BRAN: Does it have anything to do with warging?

JOJEN:  No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight.

BRAN: Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

JOJEN:  Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.

OSHA: What's he telling him?

MEERA: Why don't you ask?

OSHA:  Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?

MEERA: Where's the shame in that?

OSHA: Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.

MEERA: Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.

BRAN: When my father died, I dreamt it.

JOJEN: You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.

BRAN: You have the sight, too?

JOJEN: (Nods) When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.

BRAN: Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.

JOJEN: Yeah.

BRAN: He saved my father's life during the rebellion.

JOJEN: Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too.

BRAN: What else have you seen?

JOJEN:  Only one thing that matters-you.

CUT TO: RIVERLANDS TAVERN

The tavern is lively with drinking and laughing

MAN: I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand.

Nearby, THOROS sits with ARYA, GENDRY, and HOT PIE. He pours some ale for ARYA.

ARYA: I don't drink ale.

THOROS: There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.

MAN: Yeah!

THOROS: You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-

ARYA: We're not children.

THOROS: How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?

ARYA: Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.

THOROS: A smith, eh? Where'd you train?

GENDRY: King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.

THOROS: That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.

GENDRY: That's because he's twice as good.

THOROS: Aha! A smith and a salesman.

ARYA: Gendry stole us weapons.

THOROS: Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.

ARYA: He knows how to use a sword and so do I.

The men laugh.

ARYA: My brothers taught me.

The men laugh again. ARYA stands to prove herself. She draws her sword and points it at THOROS's throat.

MEN: Ooh!

THOROS looks at the blade, and feints a drink. Instead, he rises, draws his sword and disarms ARYA with a sweeping move of his blade. Surprised, ARYA steps backward, afraid. The men cheer. THOROS takes some dramatic and slightly drunken steps, then relents. He turns to rejoin the table, taking up some ale along the way.

THOROS: To your brothers!

The men cheer. ARYA meekly picks up her weapon and sits back down at the table, next to the silent GENDRY and HOT PIE.

THOROS: You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.

ARYA: You'll free us?

THOROS: I gave you my word.

The trio rises. So does THOROS.

THOROS: But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-

THOROS is interrupted by the smiling entrance of ANGUY and more brothers, with a large hooded captive. They are proud of their capture.

ANGUY : Hey, hey.

The men cheer.

THOROS: Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?

ANGUY: One waits for him to drink until he passes out.

THOROS: Poor man. You have my sympathy.

He removes the hood. The captive is THE HOUND. ARYA is worried, and turns away before she can be seen.

THOROS: Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!

The men howl in jest.

THOROS: So good to see you again, Clegane.

THE HOUND: Thoros? The fuck you doing here?

THOROS: Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.

HOT PIE, GENDRY, and ARYA start to leave.

THOROS: A pretty prize, lads.

MEN: Yeah!

THE HOUND recognizes ARYA.

THE HOUND: Girl.

ARYA freezes, then turns to face him.

THE HOUND: (to Thoros) What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?

EXT: RIVERLANDS

JAIME and BRIENNE walk along a river and approach a stone bridge.

JAIME:  It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.

BRIENNE: Silence, Kingslayer.

JAIME: Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.

BRIENNE: Good luck.

JAIME: It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?

CUT TO: RIVERLANDS BRIDGE

BRIENNE and JAIME have chosen the bridge.

JAIME: Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.

BRIENNE: Be quick about it.

When they reach the middle of the bridge, JAIME sits down, back to the wall.

JAIME: I need to rest.

BRIENNE: Get up.

JAIME: I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?

BRIENNE: Get up now.

She looks around, feeling nervous and exposed.

JAIME: Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.

BRIENNE tires of his ploy. He grabs him and tries to make JAIME stand back up.

JAIME: This heel is ruined. There's no way-

JAIME takes his opportunity and grabs BRIENNE's sword from its sheath. He runs as far as he can before the rope stops him. He cuts it with the sword. His hands are still bound, but he measures the feel of the sword, and chuckles.

JAIME:  I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.

BRIENNE takes an aggressive stance. JAIME is playful and cavalier, trying to goad BRIENNE into making an ill-conceived move. She remains conservative in her tactics. They take stock of one another.

JAIME: Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.

JAIME begins an attack. Their sword clash.

JAIME: You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.

JAIME lunges again and pushes BRIENNE back. She counters, but he regains momentum. In a spinning move, they switch places.

JAIME: Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you.

He attacks again. They end with their swords in contest and switch to a game of strength and leverage.

JAIME: You're good. Graceless, but good.

BRIENNE uses her hilt to break the deadlock with an upward thrust of her sword. They face off again. This time, BRIENNE goes on the attack. She gains the advantage, and knees him in the stomach.

JAIME: See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.

JAIME spins to increase the force of his attacking blow, and drives BRIENNE back down the bridge. Their shoulders collide and they face off once again, panting heavily. JAIME starts a new assault, but BRIENNE parries and gains the upper hand. She punches him in the jaw and he reels to the bridge wall. BRIENNE's next blow misses, but ignites sparks on the wall. BRIENNE grows stronger and confident as JAIME is beaten. Exhausted, he ends up on the ground. A horse neighs just off the bridge, and BRIENNE looks to locate who has joined them. Three mounted men ride out from the woods, with additional forces behind.

LOCKE: Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.

JAIME: We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.

LOCKE: You sure he's the one?

The MAN that JAIME and BRIENNE encountered in the woods  is brought forth.

MAN:  That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

LOCKE: Give the man his silver.

JAIME: Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.

LOCKE: Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours.

The mounted men move forward onto the bridge. BRIENNE and JAIME step backward, with no options available to hold off such numbers.",Game of Thrones,1975,"[47, 51, 62, 73]",4

Try to remember that kind of September, when
When life was slow and oh, so mellow, hum

Oh, why does it seem the past is always better
We look back and think
The winters were warmer
The grass was greener
The skies were bluer
And smiles were bright

Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me
Would we
Could we

Memories, like the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Oh, can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me.. haha...

295,(Call Me Your) Anything Man,"[Intro: Joey J]
I'm sinking and drowning
My feet on the ground but-
I'm thinking about it
Let's stop with the shouting

We'll figure it out but-
Maybe we won't
I say that I do
You say that I don't

I can remember the end
I just remember you in my arms
I just remember our view of the stars
Fell in love and then I fell apart

[Spoken Interlude]
I'm just- I'm sick of being alone man
Like, I don't think I can do this anymore man
I don't care about anything man
Like, at certain point you start to realize, like
What if this is me man, what if the problem is me man
And I'm just sick of it man, I'm just, I'm sick of being alone man
I just, I don't care anymore

[Verse 1: Shanker]
I know your deepest secrets
Used to look me in the eye
You say you never mean it
When you wish our love could die

Telling me, telling me, telling me I could be everything
Thinking 'bout everyday all of it turning to memories
I never, I never cared you just how much you meant to me
Feeling your loving you singing out all of my melodies
Feeling like I been so out of my mind
Running all out of my time
Wish you were mine
I, I'm spending my days tryna cut out the noise
Never could say I'm your man
Always just call me your boy

[Chorus: Belle Jewel]
Turn off your lights
Stay up all night
Tell me you see all these tears in my eyes
Hold out your hand
Take all my time
Tell me you see through my eyes

Honey you don't even know my love, deep in your heart
Baby you don't even need my touch, I'm falling apart

[Verse 2: Joey J]
All of this just feels too soon
I got out of bed today
But you were still the first thought in my head today
Fighting the urge to text you is like boxing a heavyweight
Steady grief weighing on my conscience
Like damn I really had the world and I lost this shit
Damn I tried to keep changing but my pocket ripped
That's why she kept on telling me that I ain't got no sense

And it could've been a simple fix for me
And we could've worked it out eventually
All you needed from me was some honesty
And that feeling slowly creeping up on me

Darling you gave me love
(Something special)
Took me places that I
(Can't forget)

How am I gon' be alone?
How am I gon' let you go?

[Chorus: Belle Jewel]
Turn off your lights
Stay up all night
Tell me you see all these tears in my eyes
Hold out your hand
Take all my time
Tell me you see through my eyes

And that Rolls Royce float
Clean, like I put a set of gold things on a bar of soap
What's in every bar? Another motivational quote
While these niggas going through phases
I never mutated or deviated from the life or mission statement
This is preservation of the vibe
Never let them forget the time
Well they say you was a rapper
You fasho had to know how to rhyme
I keep my passport close, 'cause it eases my mind
(eases my mind)

[Interlude]
It's a shame what they did to it
Now the rap just don't go that same route
When they take rawness away, just
Just they make it too pretty

[Verse 1 Continued: Curren$y]
I'm feelin' trapped on this revolvin' land mine
That could blow at any minute
Saturday night special with one bullet in the chamber
And six cylnders spinnin'
Russian Roulette, the American Dream could be your death
Or it could be everything

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
It's M.O.B. everything
Back in '03 had Gucci seats, I put Gs on everything
Made matrimony with this game
I got cocaine when it rains
Them niggas taxin' for the nina
They want like ten and some change
I got my tears and my pain
I got my balls and my girl
And I ain't breakin' that shit for a nigga or bitch
That shit is absurd
I'm controversial with these verbs
Like Christopher Wallace with words
Felix Mitchell with birds
Malcolm X with the perm

[Interlude]
Freddie Gibbs; I heard the name, but I didn't know
Like, I didn't know how good he was
It was after the photoshoot
After I had already shook hands with him and met him
I told him this when I seen him again, too, out in LA
I was like, yo, I was like, yo, I ain't even know, like, you really good

[Verse 2 Continued: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah
Bitch hit my line said she wanna go eat and drink and smoke and shit (Goofy bitch)
Before I hung up, I said call me when you want some dick
(Want some dick)
I'll never go broke in this game
I'll charge it on a bitch (Charge it on a bitch)
So, my family and my kids will never want for shit
Stuck in a cell with no windows but I got a pot to piss
Smokin' that dope on a daily
Fucked up the probation, I gotta go drop some piss
Hope in a truck, and I throw on that Twista
Adrenaline Rush on some mobster shit
Even when niggas was broke
We made it look rich, bitch, I'ma optimist
My presence'll fuck up your confidence
Freaky bitches, I'm they confidant
Trappin' out of muh fuckas rappers, slappin' these Poppadoc
RZA with the zippers, official men chop it off the block
Once I made an M, I ain't give a fuck if I popped or not
And I can't swim, a nigga ain't never had dreams of coppin' yachts
But I kowabunga, servin' that pussy at a thousand knots
Rest in peace to Ruck, tell Jesus I need a billion bucks
Goon with the balloon, ain't no helium, but I sealed him up

297,The Biggest Parakeets In Town,"[Mark Kozelek]
Fell asleep with a headache, just woke up and I'm feeling better now
I fell asleep watching The Seventies on Netflix
Jim Jones, John Gacy, Son of Sam, the Manson Trial
There's more but I fell asleep, but I was a kid then
So I remember a lot of it anyhow, just like you did
I was in kindergarten in 1972 when Duran fought Kenny Buchanan at MSG in New York
The results flash across the TV, and in 1974 I was 7
And Richard Nixon resigned, and I was 8, and Vietnam ended in 1975

[Mark Kozelek]
I thought about you growing up in the Bronx, did you fear Son of Sam?
What was your first concert? Mine was a Doobie Brothers
My mom took me and some others and that part was nice
And I walked around for a while by myself and I saw a shocking amount of sex
Going on back in the trees, girls down on their knees
Guys with their backs against the trees

[Mark Kozelek]
Whoa oh oh, listen to the music
Whoa oh oh, listen to the music
Whoa oh oh, listen to the music
Whoa oh oh, listen to the music

[Mark Kozelek]
Lots of music centered my first live concert experience
My first attempt at a sexual experience was when two older girls
Took me and a friend across Millers Road in Massillon, Ohio
It was a field back then, and there was a small hill
And beyond the hill, we were smoking and the girls asked us
""Do you guys have hard-ons?""
We never heard the term, didn't know what it meant
We asked them, ""What are hard-ons?""
And they smirked and after a while, one girl shrugged her shoulders to the other
And very slowly, the four of stood up and left
The girls were walking ahead of us, as if we didn't exist
Down the street, they crossed
They looked so tall as we trailed behind them
""What's a hard-on? What's a hard-on?"" they were asking each other
At seven years old, we smoked cigarettes
But we didn't know what the term ""hard-on"" meant

[Mark Kozelek]
So yeah, I remember these things when I was 4, 5, 6, and 7
What do you recall of those years, Kevin?

[Mark Kozelek]
I remember Frazier, Frazier, Frazier from the kid across the street
Whose smoke and joke beat Ali
In 1972 on TV, Frazier was saying that Ali was taunting him in the rain
Frazier said, ""Ali was saying to me
'Don't you know that I'm God? Don't you know that I'm God?'""
Frazier had a witty reply, but I don't remember what it was, do you?

[Mark Kozelek]
As a kid, did you ever go to the zoo?
I have no memories of ever going to a zoo with you
But we went to an enormous barn where my dad bought us parakeets so many times
So many times because they always died
They'd never last a week, those parakeets, from what we called Parakeet Prison
I hated the guy who owned it, but looking back on it now
He was just a parakeet supplier in Ohio, trying to make a living
But yeah at the time, I hated that guy
He and my dad would talk for what seemed like hours and hours
In that big smelly barn that smelled like a pigsty
An eternity of metal cages coated with bird shit
Thousands of iridescent birds fluttering and fluttering
Feathers floating through the air, like a bomb went off
The crud got into our lungs and we choked on parakeet feathers

[Mark Kozelek]
While my dad and him kept talking and talking, big smiles on their faces
The guy always had these gross green clothes covered in bird shit
He looked like a walking Picasso, I mean Jackson Pollock
But ""Picasso"" rhymes better with ""clothes""
And ""Picasso"" rhymes better with ""coming home""
Taking turns vomiting privately, never letting dad know
Dad was obsessed with us having parakeets that would live
He kept trying and trying, but they kept dying
Don't know if it was the temperature at home or the Ohio climate
But eventually we were so tormented by those trips to buy those dying birds
We'd be awake all night, dreading going back to Parakeet Prison

[Mark Kozelek]
One morning, our dad woke us up, so pumped up to go get more parakeets
We were scared to tell him we didn't want to go back there anymore
I was a brother, so I did all the talking
If my dad was triggered, I wanted to be the one to take the beating
I said, ""Dad, the parakeets keep dying, we don't want to go back there anymore""

[Mark Kozelek]
Dad went easy on us, I could see his heart in his eyes
The parakeets dying was breaking our hearts
But he wanted us to have something colorful and vibrant
To think of him fondly while he was out of town
That amounted to us flushing dead parakeets down the toilet
In addition to our dad being gone

[Mark Kozelek]
My first movie was went my mom's friend somehow snuck us into to Jaws
I just remembered that it had to be kept secret
She said she was taking us to some mall in some far away suburb to shop
Her husband was strict, and her fear of her getting caught and her nervousness
Eclipses my memory of the movie
So Kevin, what do you remember of your life between the ages of 4 and 7?

[Kevin Corrigan]
I don't know how Frazier replied to Ali during that fight at MSG
But I lived on a steep hill called Loring Place
One day, water came rushing down the gutter on my side of the street
Flowing beneath the Pintos and the Cutlass Supremes
And charging down Loring Place to the main avenue, Fordham Road
Someone had opened a hydrant up the hill
But to me, the North Pole had melted
The Watergate had broke, the one I'd been hearing about
The water from Watergate coming from the top down
How could such a thing happen? Was safety an illusion?
How long before the flood waters rose
And before it reached the 6th floor of the building where I lived?

[Kevin Corrigan]
I'm pretty sure the first movie I saw was in a movie theater, on Valentine
It was The Towering Inferno
I remember the fire blazing out of control from the middle of the building
Working its way up, people trapped on the top floor above the fire
They were sitting ducks, their only chance of survival
Was to blow up the tanks on the roof that held the building's water supply
And hope it was enough to stop the fire and not drown themselves in the process
Tying themselves down to keep from getting washed away

[Kevin Corrigan]
Oh, and far as zoos
I remember this guy made the front page of the Post and the Daily News
For climbing in the tiger exhibit at the Bronx Zoo
His photo was taken with a long lens but there he was, across the fence
Just like you or me, seated in a Buddhist-like position with a tiger right next to him
Its head tilted in fear or confusion, its right paw in mid-swipe
The guy was wearing a satin baseball jacket or windbreaker
Holding out his hand like he wanted to pet the tiger
He got roughed up, the zookeepers were able to distract the animal
Got the guy outta there and sent him to Jacobi Hospital
Staff gave his ripped up jacket to his mother
I knew the zoo, I knew where the incident occurred
The paper said the guy had a history of mental illness
How long did he have this idea, I wondered
How long had he thought about doing this?
Or was it a spur of the moment thing?
""I'd like to get close up to those tigers, close enough to touch them""
What did crossing that line finally involve?
What was the difference between doing it and just walking away?
Was it insanity? Was it bravery?
I asked this friend I was hanging out with that summer, Arthur Macguffin
Who said, ""No question, the guy was nuts but even if he was
It still takes guts to get in a cage with a tiger""

[Kevin Corrigan]
Oh, the Son of Sam, that's a vivid memory
I remember a lot of people seemed crazy back then
It seemed like a thing that was going around, like a spirit
David Berkowitz used to work at the post office up the block from my uncle Sam
It was strange, to have a cousin Sam that was the son of my uncle Sam
I remember the blackout of '77
I remember the Yankees winning the World Series that year and the following year
I remember seeing the Sex Pistols on a late night show, Night Bird or Midnight Special
And feeling like they weren't that different from the Son of Sam
I remember a Canadian TV show that aired on Saturday morning
Hilarious House of Frankenstein, hosted by Vincent Price

[Mark Kozelek]
You lived on a hill, too? So did I
And a Cutlass Supreme, my dad had one of those, a company car
I believe that you had a fear of a flood coming and being washed away
My friend's fear that disaster was on its way was when we flew to LA
To see my grandmother and my grandfather, I'd never been on a plane
Who knows what was going on? Maybe the hostage situation, maybe
I don't know, but it was my first flight and I thought
Maybe it might go down in flames

[Mark Kozelek]
It was a summer between the second and first grade and my ears were popping
And it was such a piercing, excruciating pain, I'll never forget that pain
I was probably crying and the pain was so bad I don't even remember crying
All I remember is that my dad didn't go
Early sign of my mom and dad's divorce but I was too young to see it coming
You know, I've never seen Asians until we got to Los Angeles
Next door to where my grandparents lived
Their neighbors, their names were the Hongs
A song about that trip to see a hummingbird, seeing Benji in the theater
Hearing Bowie's ""Young Americans"" for the first time
But a memory that stands out that I've never sang or written about
Was how the houses all looked the same in that neighborhood
And there was a park across the street where we would play
My sister was over there and she ran across the street to my grandparent's house
But accidentally ran into the Hongs' house
It was her first time at that place, we never met them yet
She found herself in the living room of a Chinese family
And she started screaming, like you hear in horror films
When someone's being stabbed to death and they're bleeding to death
And in fear, the Hongs walked her back to her grandmother's
We were on our way over there to see what was the matter
She was sobbing all day, my sister is so delicate
I mean, how would anybody expect her to act?
We grew up on Wonder bread and Velveeta cheese and everybody we knew
Except my dad's friend Moses and my friend Lamont, were white

[Mark Kozelek]
We went to the Queen Mary on that trip to LA, the world opened up to me
And I knew that on the west coast, I would live one day
And here I am at 51 in San Francisco, laying next to my Vietnamese girlfriend
My doctor is Chinese, my landlord is Chinese
My dentist is Korean, my guitarist is Filipino
California's my first taste of diversity, I must have loved the taste
Because it's where I ended up 3000 miles away from where I grew up
Because I was too much of an outcast to stay
I'm from the biggest high school football town in the USA
That's no bullshit, Massillon, Ohio, Go Tigers!
There's a documentary, rent it today

[Mark Kozelek]
Chris Spielman's from my hometown
His widow Stephanie Belcher, she was the most popular girl in high school
He married her and she was diagnosed with cancer, she ended up dying
He ended his football career to help her
I never thought I'd feel anything for anybody who played football
But I felt for Chris Spielman
I just realized from the years from 4 to 7 were the years where the seeds were planted
The seeds that sprouted and blossomed into who I am
I watched two kids boxing at the boxing gym today
And of all things, they were siblings, 4 and 7, I asked my boxing teacher
""What do you think makes these kids end up boxing at this age?""
He said, ""Circumstance, there's always something, you never know""
At the ages between 4 and 7, my destiny was set in motion
Between those ages, I fell in love with
Music, culture, crime, California, the fight game, and girls
And no, to this day, I've never owned any pet birds
And I still hate flying, and I still hate football
But I still have a cigarette every now and then after a show
And I found what a hard-on was, oh man did I ever
And here I am, about to fall asleep, in my apartment
On top of Nob Hill, in San Francisco",Mark Kozelek with Petra Haden,1975,"[50, 52, 59, 69, 79, 89]",6

A story of change that came with wings

Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala
Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga
I’m the cum-lada, top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask, pure religion and cash
From the windows that open, I’m raising my glass
Daylight beams, night life schemes

Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M, dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or
D. Rose, from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant

Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh
Even now it don't seem so bad, ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be
Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy
My broad up in Paris, looking all purty

I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

[Outro: Makeba]
I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running til' I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, until high we'll shine at night

And we going higher, that's right",Common,1975,"[57, 57, 67, 78, 89]",5

Something foreign I’m tourin' on foreign land
Worldwide I'm known for the Arm & Ham-
-mer—der the streets, I'm a wanted man

Started with the block, hit it brick by brick
Then I charted with the Roc nigga, hit by hit
I'm retarded with the Glock nigga, clip by clip
The competition is none, they deceased to exist
Let it breathe a little bit
He's off his rocker, he's a little schitz'
Throwed like a football, Hov used to cook raw
Now I got the game sewn like granny's good shawl
Pshaw, y'all niggas want war
Y'all got it backwards, y'all should want raw
Y'all should want more (and more, and more - uhh!)

Good weed, good drink, big money, mayne (Aye!)
Rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin' grain (Yeeeah!)

at night sometimes
when everybody's asleep.
I say, I know that you're there,
so don't be
sad.

but he's singing a little

Mascara, blood, ash and cum
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love
Honeybear, Honeybear, Honeybear
Fuck the world, damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way
But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I wanna watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked, getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden-variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in ""I-told-you-so"" voice:
""It’s just how we expected""

Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

You're bent over the altar and the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising? Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome, boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going

You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

Tonight I'll fall
Looking for something wonderful yet casual
Extraordinarily temporal
And there you are - let's go

You hooked me
On the dance floor
So here I am
Back for more

You seem experienced
Just an inch too keen on getting exposed
Having your face in every magazine
You're far from being unique
But you still look pristine
Mundanely exotic, like the French cuisine

My disco queen - let's disco
Disco queen - let's disco

2: A cheap sellout drug
You're a cheap sellout drug
On everyone's lips
Covered every day, done every way
A whole world at your hips

A bar to fit
The beats you take
Another hit
And you will break

Undressed in front of me
All glistening ebony
You're still so young, but I will show you vintage 33
I lay you on your back
Inviting curves of black
Making little noises as my needle finds your track

My disco queen - let's disco
Disco queen - let's disco...

3: A tighter groove
You leave me wanting more
Panting on all four
I know there's more to pluck, and so I go for the encore
I am turning you around
To play your other side
A tighter groove, I want it but I tremble, slip and slide

Baby, you're just what I need
You purr when I make you bleed

I pump you till you cry
Feel so alive
I crank you up
And switch to 45

A screaming climax chord
I give you all I've stored
A moment's silence and you're filled up, yet emptier than before
Oh, that subtle little sound
As I am pulling out
A finished dish upon my plate is what it's all about

A square round of greed
You surrendered to the rhythm, spinning around your hole
Disco made you famous but tonight you tasted soul

I pumped you till you cried
Felt so alive
I cranked you up
And switched to 45
You are just begging for more
But I unlock the door (Tonight I'll fall)
You're old news now and so (Looking for something wonderful yet casual)

Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches
Stop lettin' the messy hoes mess with your business
Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney
Sheesh, gosh, Oshkosh B’gosh
Smokin' on that Bob Marley, listenin' to Pete Tosh
I-I-I do me, no, I do three at a T-I-M-E
Why when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay run to us
And payday comes sooner than later 'round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there
Yeah, you see it in my face, I don’t care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wanna be fly but don’t know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten my girl be a twenty
My girls so bad make a nigga think he's sinnin'
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E
Mic check, two, three; I am different like blue pee
And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been ridin'
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stuntin', but no, I'm just survivin'
And I’ve been here, but my soul is just arrivin'
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribin'
Medication free, and for meditation we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P, as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft and bring the whammies back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga's woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these Evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami though
I act so New Orleans, yes, I go Pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me
And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me

329,I Don't Know Why,"[Verse 1]
We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passing in the shadows
Loving the risk of being found
When we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're living in a lie of trust

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

330,Only Women,"Man got his woman to take his seed
He got the power, oh
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for's
An even break
He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
Slaps you once in a while
And you live in love and pain

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all

Only women bleed

I gots to do what I gots to do
Now listen
Mkay, I keeps it G shit
And I’m a keep it G shit
Niggas ain’t gone admit it, but niggas know the real
Bitch you was just down here in the city last year on Molly birthday
Broke as hell
You couldn’t even pay for yo way back
So you had to suck Joseph dick
What the fuck is you talking about
You broke crumb ass bitch
And every- no nigga ain’t never heard of you
Bro you fucked every nigga that got a buzz
Kodak and them niggas from Glo gang
Nobody know who the fuck you is bitch
You can’t even rap, like give that shit up
Fuck is you talking about, I ain’t heard of no bitch with makeup sliding down on nigga in the hood
Bitch how many bodies you got, hmm?
Shut yo dumb ass up

[Verse]
I ain’t scared of no bitch, I ain’t scared of Cuban either
Raps got y’all fooled, I know she ain’t no shooter either
Bitch thought it was sweet, till I caught her outta hell shit
Bitches was bout to run, and I still ain’t get my nails fixed
Fuck it
I’ll be broke, but y’all bitches don’t sell shit
Knew you hoes was weak
Jump in some beef so how you scared bitch
It’s the real B
And I ain’t come to play around this bitch
You in Detroit, I’m on yo ass
Y’all can’t stay around this bitch
I got a shooter with a drum
And I keep his ass on stand by
Bitches playing dirty then they mans die
These hoes be talking, I can beat em with my hands tied
Bitch ain’t have no hands, even her mans ain’t even swing by
Bitch ain’t got no friends, even yo mans know you can’t swing Ma
Fucked a couple rappers, now she think she the man huh
Was sending threats to Asian, how you geeked cause she yo friend now
Got fucked by Kodak Black, but you ain’t got a Benz now
Make that bitch get on her knees, Tadoe blacked her eyes
You was dick sucking Molly, now she ain’t on yo side
Came out the stu and felt these hands, bitch I’m hurting yo pride
Lil bitch was playing tough, till I caught her outside
So all that draco, cut it
You keep telling me lies
Every bitch I’m with would’ve dogged every one of yo guys
Had my hung with both hands, you couldn’t swing if you tried
How you fronting like you won, bitch we all know you lying
Why these hoes don’t model, cause they funny rappping
I got boo’d in my city, cause they funny acting
Everybody outside know what really happened
These bitches soft to sum it up, this what really happened
Joseph begging Natashia to pull me off of you
The bitch you came with ain’t even bust a move
So if we jumped
Shoot, yo mans was right in front of you
You should be dissing her not me, but that’s what dummies do
Was looking for that chain, cause that bitch was coming off of you
Next time you know to shield, or this shit is off of you
If you busy winning, how the fuck you know what I can do
You are not a street bitch, you are just a prostitute
You ain’t hurt nobody, shit I knocked the lashes off of you
Bitches want some smoke
Shit, I knocked the ashes off of you
I’m a find out who yo writer is and smack that nigga
Same reason why a bitch always rapping niggas
Joseph’s pussy ass was shooked
My bitches should’ve grab that nigga
I ain’t surprised, same reason why I laugh at niggas
They just hate I’m in my bag though
My young niggas say I’m acting like a asshole
Couple niggas switch, tell I ain’t mad though
Praying on my downfall, but still ain’t got a bag though
And these bitches ain’t got shit coming
Only time a bitch is nice is when the bitch cumming
And they be stalking my life, but swear a bitch nothing
And they be talking bout ice, as if that means something
Lil bitch get yo shit snatched
And we ain’t lacking over here, get yo shit smacked

[Outro]
I mean sis when the fuck was it cool to drop a diss song after you get yo ass beat
Like you gotta look in the mirror every fucking day
Bitch
You mad you took that L
All my bitches up
Dumb ass bitch
Try that shit again (All that ra ra shit y’all be doing in y’all videos)
Try that shit again
Bitch that is not true
Fuck is you talking about
Ain’t no fuck Bando, it’s fuck you
Where the fuck was them dracos at when you got yo shit beat in

You ain't been on my mind

Will you meet me in the air?

For the very last time

Show a little tenderness
Mama, before you go
Please, let me feel
Your embrace once more

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while

We all must feel
Heartache sometime
Right now, right now
I'm feeling mine

I tried my best to be strong
But I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child
Left in a cradle

Before you leave me
Mama, leave me far behind
Please, let me feel
Happy one more time

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while

I'm losing you
And my happiness
My life is so dark
I must confess

I'll never, never see
Your smiling face no more
I'll never, never hear
Your knock upon my door

Before you leave me
Leave me behind
Please, let me feel
Happy one more time

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, baby
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, yeah yeah

I'm begging, little baby (take me)
Oh baby, please, yeah
(Take me, take me, take me)
Come on, baby (take me)
Can't you see me on my knees now
(Take me, take me, take me)

Come on, baby (take me)
Baby, help, please

Coming to you, baby (take me)
Oh baby, please, please, please

335,Wooden Heart,"We’re all born to broken people on their most honest day of living
And since that first breath, we’ll need grace that we’ve never given (well)
Well, I've been haunted by standard red devils and white ghosts
It's not only when these eyes are closed
These lies are ropes that I tie down in my stomach
But they hold this ship together, tossed like leaves in this weather
My dreams are sails that I point towards my true north
Stretched thin over my rib bones, and pray that it gets better
But it won’t, at least I don’t believe it will...

So I've built a wooden heart inside this iron ship
To sail these blood red seas and find your coasts
Don’t let these waves wash away your hopes
This war-ship is sinking, and I still believe in anchors
Pulling fist fulls of rotten wood from my heart, oh
I still believe in saviors
Because we are all made out of shipwrecks, every single board
Washed and bound like crooked teeth on these rocky shores
So come on and let’s wash each other
With tears of joy and tears of grief
And fold our lives like crashing waves and run up on this beach
Come on and sew us together
Just some tattered rags stained forever
We only have what we remember

I am the barely-living son of a woman and man who barely made it
But we’re making it
Taped together on borrowed crutches and new starts
We all have the same holes in our hearts
Everything falls apart at the exact same time
It all comes together perfectly for the next step
But my fear is this prison that I keep locked below the main deck
I keep a key under my pillow, it’s quiet and it’s hidden
And my hopes are weapons that I’m still learning how to use right
But they’re heavy and I’m awkward, I'm always running out of fight

So I’ve carved a wooden heart, put it in this sinking ship
Hoping it would help me float for just a few more weeks
But I am all made out of shipwrecks, every twisted beam
Lost and found like you and me, all scattered out on the seas
So come on, let’s wash each other
With tears of joy and tears of grief
And fold our lives like crashing waves and run up on this beach
Come on and sew us together
We're just some tattered rags stained forever
We only have what we remember

My throat, it still tastes like house fire and salt water
I wear this tide like loose skin, come on and rock me to sea
If we hold on tight, we’ll hold each other together
And not just be some fools rushing to die in our sleep
While these machines will rust, I promise
But we'll still be electric, shocking each other back to life
Your hand in mine, my fingers and your veins connected
Our bones grown together in time
Our hands entwined, and my fingers and your veins connected
Our spines grown stronger inside
'Cause I know that our church is all made out of shipwrecks
From every hull these rocks have claimed
But we pick ourselves up
And try and grow better through this change
So come on and let’s wash each other
With tears of joy and tears of grief
And fold our lives like crashing waves and run up on this beach
Come on and sew us together
We're just some tattered rags stained forever
We only have what we remember",Listener,1975,"[91, 58, 63, 73, 84]",5

Way down deep in the secret part of me

And only you can stop the fire

When you're not right here beside me
All the world is standing still
Girl, I need what only you can give to me

There's an emptiness inside me
Only you alone can fill
Girl, I need for you and love with me

It's got me going up in flames
And only you can bring the rain

So many will be the blessings and so short will the time, I'll stay with you
But I'll play for you, I love you yes I do. You can say that I'm your friend
You can see my life begin and end. I'll always play for you

Hear the band, hear the band. Won't you let the music take you, hear the band
And let this night go on forever, and don't you ever stop the music. Let your spirit set you free
Hear the band, hear the band. You can sing and stomp you feet and clap your hands
And these few moments we'll share together, and I'll play for you

I've practiced many years and I have come a long, long way just to play for you
My life is but a song that I have written in many ways, just to say to you
To say, I love you yes I do. And I'd like for you to be

Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much

As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm
I'm just a regular kid, at my crib
Doin' regular shit, burnin' 5 spliffs
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'm a pour another cup and roll another zone
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me, hit me on Twitter
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name
Waitin' at the station till it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin bout
Pour a little liquor then I drink it down

'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro

I spend another night alone
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank god for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gate
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and
Burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do it's nothin' new

'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro

Tomorrow for Old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales

And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see that foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into Hell

I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee

And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the Dale

[Verse]
You don't wanna feel nothing close to this
See for good behavior, he was the poster kid
We were all smoking weed, he wasn't smoking it
Always looking like Novak Djokovic
Martin came in the game called America from Bulgaria
A work visa on the foreign exchange
He worked eighty hour weeks all exhausted
Boiling lobsters all summer for the tourists in Maine
And he was good at it, he did such a dank job
That his coworkers nicknamed him ""the Tank God""
Boss noticed it, it wasn't overlooked
Got every order out on time and never overcooked
The way he'd swing the saber, split the claws like an English major
In the steam of the tank he would blink at vapors
Go hard, put the dishes in the sink for later
His hard work stuck out like dicks in pajamas
Saturday night dinner rush
Slayed more slips than bananas
Bumping Juelz Santana with Amber
Clock out, high-five, apron in the hamper
He could only do right in his new life
His boss copped him a brand new blue bike
It was a Raleigh, balling
Now he could bike to work instead of waiting for the trolley
It had a mini Maine license plate
""TANKGOD"" on it with the letters engraved
Upon receiving the gift, his eyes started leaking a bit
He was completely appreciative
He felt good the next couple weeks rollin'
New bike plus he got a raise, like golden
Sunlight, then one night he laid his head down
Woke up the next day, the bike's nowhere to be found
He said ""shit"" in Bulgarian and walked to work
He was so disheartened that he forgot his shirt
He worked a double then he got a ride home from Amber
He told her he was impressed how she drove a standard
But as they turned onto his road
They saw the red and blue lights dancing on the windows
""I wonder what happened,"" said Martin
And then they saw that they were parked right in front of his apartment
Cops and guards, chargers and one in a larger
SUV surrounded Martin's cottage by the harbor
They came to bust a thief, sucks to be
Martin ’cause he's who they want in custody
So he steps out the whip, looking European
They said, ""Put your fucking hands up where I can see 'em!""
Martin complied, though he didn't know why
""I mean, I had always been such a good guy""
But the cops thought, that they had caught him red-handed
The eastern European voiced blue bike bandit
But Martin had been robbed, God damn it
He had woken up this morning and his bike had vanished
But, now the bike was back
Lying next to it was an envelope in the grass
The type people use when depositing cash
""What the fuck did I do?"" Martin wanted to ask
But now, it's all cuffed wrists and Mirandas
Tears slid down his cheek
He yelled, ""I don't know what I did!"" to Amber
She stood there, sobbing in the streets
See, Martin won the bad luck lottery
He got fucked in the ass, no sodomy
Just a bullshit end to the Odyssey
He got charged with a aggravated robbery

[Verse 1]
You'd see him busking on Grafton Street
People never took a notice just passing see
By all means he wasn't anything great but
As the months went on he start playing shit straight
A broken Guitar & a wore out voice
No Frank Sinatra there but this kid was nice
Melodies mixed with emotions he'd pour them out
Not for the fame he'd explain but for food in his mouth
He'd open up with his songs
Hasn't a place to call home but knows music is where he belongs
His world fades away while he embraces here
He prays a brighter day but gets a taste of fear
A rare talent nowadays in a greedy town came
A fella that amazed with a needed sound
And he'd never compromise
See this fella had the flame in his stomach and the stars in his eyes

And it was back when the nights flew
Who'd have thought nowadays he'd even like you
Came from nothing, made a name in the scene
Now you're quoting Biggie Smalls like 'It was all a dream'
Flashbacks to the time spent learning your craft
People laughed at your songs played out in the gaff
Now their hanging on your every line
About time they took notice and a shine to this kid in his prime
No more knocking back pints hoping life improves
Coping nice you choose, you weren't born to lose
See this fella was the best
He'd have you hooked on every word while singing his worries off his chest
He'd just sing old songs of his life
Give him a moment of your time and let him
Show you what it's like and maybe then you'll realize
That this fella has more than just the passion and
The stars in his eyes

Every panic tear infused
We will survive

Why does something so good feels so damn hard tonight?
When its nobody's fault then we'll tire to try

Through the dead of the night

That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

350,Black Friday,"[Produced By Vinylz]

[Intro]
Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

[Verse]
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-

351,Old Days,"[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up, still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open, and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was
Those good old days

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

[Verse 3: Macklemore & Kesha]
Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

[Bridge: Kesha]
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes, 'til it's gone

[Chorus: Kesha]
I wish somebody would have told me, babe
Someday, these will be the good old days

And all these reckless nights you won't regret

Niggas say ""Live fast, die young,"" so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard ""Can't Get Enough""
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto

Could write a book called, ""The Things Hoes Say""

Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit

Couldn't sell crack but I rap good

Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya

Do the mashed potato in a new attitude
Do the hully gully in a new attitude

Observe some natural dude

Preacher man talkin' on TV
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation

Would like to do a little walkin' too

A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt

But I will take another toke

And me and Judy Mae

And before he would say goodbye
He'd tell me to take care of my new mama
She's the apple of his eye

And as he kissed his brand new wife goodbye
I always used to hear him say
Look after my boy
Won't you please, now, Judy Mae

Oh, she sure had a way of looking after me
Yes, her eyes would sparkle and shine

Well, one night while my daddy was gone
She tiptoed into my room
She said that she had to talk to me
Cause my dad was gonna be home soon

She said, you know
I get so lonely and cold
When your daddy is gone for days
What a boy like you could do to Judy Mae

Well, I told her that I'd never done this before
And then she took my hand
And showed me all of the secret things
That turned a boy into a man

And as I lay there by her side
I heard a noise at the window pane
I think that's just the wind
Said Judy Mae

Judy Mae
Oh, she sure had a way of looking after me
Yes, her eyes would sparkle and shine
Every time Papa got ready to leave

Well, the next day
Daddy had an accident
And two days later, he died

Could drive too good to even
Try to take a turn that wide

But thinking back now
I begin to wonder
To this very day

That saw me with Judy Mae

Hope was all I had until you came

You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filing the world surrounding me

And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me

And so much is left for us to see

I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion

Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor

Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail
Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

[Verse 3]
I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor
Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

Tell me now, don't it remind you
Of a blanket on the ground

Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slipping out of town
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground

Oh, remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We couldn't wait for night to come

Now you know you still excite me
I know you love me like I am
Just once more I wish you'd love me
On the blanket on the ground

414,Long Tall Glasses (I Can Dance),"I was travellin' down the road feelin' hungry and cold
I saw a sign sayin' ""Food and Drinks for Everyone""
So naturally, I thought I would take me a look inside
I saw so much food there was water coming from my eyes

Yeah, there was ham and there was turkey, there was caviar
And long tall glasses with wine up to y'are
Then somebody grabbed me, threw me out of my chair
Said, ""Before you can eat, you gotta dance like Fred Astaire""

You know I can't dance, you know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, you know I can't dance, I can't dance!

I am a man of the road, a hobo by name
I don't seek entertainment, just poultry and game
But if it's all the same to you then yes, I will try my hand
If you were hungry as me then I'm sure you will understand

Hmm, now wait a minute, of course I can dance
Of course I can dance, I'm sure I can dance
I'm sure I can dance, I can dance
I can dance, I really hit the floor, ah, it feels good
Look at me dancin'!

I did a Two Step, Quick Step and a Bossanova
A little Victor Sylvester and a Rudy Valentino
You should have seen me moving right across the floor
Hand me down my tuxedo, next week I'm coming back for more

I can dance, oh yes, I can dance
Look at me dance on the floor movin'
I feel good, I can dance, I can dance
I can dance, I can dance, I can dance, I can dance

416,Remember The Rain?,"[Verse 1]
We used to play out in the rain
Your mother scolded us
She said that we were bad
(She said that we were bad)
I thought I'd better go on home (stepped it up and)
You watched till I was gone
Ooh, girl, you looked so sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I picked you up when you fell and cut your knee
I told you not to cry and held you close to me

[Interlude]
As I was running through the storm
To get my umbrella
(Think about it / Think)
I stopped in shock when I saw you
With another fellow, oh, wow

[Chorus]
Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?
You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself

[Verse 2]
You broke so many rules in school
I took the blame for you
I guess I was the fool
You used to sneak me notes in class
I winked my eye and laughed
Those days went by so fast

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got remarks that torn us all apart
I'm still tryna put back the pieces to my heart

[Interlude 2]
And I'll be crying your name, girl
Until my very last breath
(Think about it / Think)
'Cause my existence without you
Ain't nothing but a little death

417,It's A Miracle,"[Verse 1]
Miraculous you call it, babe
You ain't seen nothing yet
They got Pepsi in the Andes
They got McDonald's in Tibet
Yosemite has been turned into a golf course for the Japs
And the Dead Sea is alive with rap
Between the Tigris and Euphrates
There's a leisure center now
They got all kinds of sports, they got Bermuda shorts
They had sex in Pennsylvania
A Brazilian grew a tree
And a doctor in Manhattan saved a dying man for free

[Chorus]
It's a miracle (It's a miracle), it's a miracle
It's a miracle, another miracle
By the grace of God almighty
And the pressures of the market place
The human race has civilized itself
It's a miracle

[Verse 2]
We got warehouses of butter
We got oceans of wine
We got famine when we need it
We got designer crime
We got Mercedes, we got Porsch
, Ferrari and Rolls Royce
Yeah, we got choice...
She said meet me in the garden
Of Gethsemane my dear
The Lord said Peter, I can see your house from here
An honest man finally reaped what he had sown
And a farmer in Ohio has just repaid a loan

[Chorus]
It's a miracle (It's a miracle), it's a miracle
It's a miracle, another miracle
By the grace of God almighty
And the pressures of the market place
The human race has civilized itself
It's a miracle

[Verse 3]
We cower in our shelters with our hands over our ears
Lloyd-Webber's awful stuff runs for years and years and years
An earthquake hits the theater, but the operetta lingers
Then the piano lid comes down and breaks his fucking fingers

418,Chevy Van,"[Verse 1]
I gave a girl
A ride in my wagon
She crawled in and took control
She was tired
As her mind was a-draggin'
I said get some sleep and dream of rock and roll

[Chorus]
'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

[Verse 2]
Her young face
Was like that of an angel
Her long legs were tanned and brown
Better keep
Your eyes on the road, son
Better slow this vehicle down

[Chorus]
'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

[Verse 3]
I put her out
In a town that was so small
You could throw a rock from end to end
A dirt road Main Street
She walked off in bare feet
It's a shame I won't be passin' through again

[Chorus]
'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
We made love in my Chevy van

Your body feels so warm
And your hair smells
Like a Sunday morning

I feel you moving closer
And I know what you're gonna say
But girl there's just no way
I'll ever like what you'll be saying

Don't tell me goodnight
It makes me feel so empty inside
And if only I could
I wouldn't sleep at all
Don't tell me goodnight
Just let me drift off slowly away
And dream of you

You reach out and you touch me
Just to let me know you're there

421,Young Americans,"[Verse 1]
They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
""Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?""
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

[Chorus]
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

[Verse 2]
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries ""Where have all Papa's heroes gone?""

[Chorus]
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

[Bridge]
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
""We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""

All night
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(He wants the young American)
(All right) All right
He wants the young American

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?

Have been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

Like a leaf that's only landing suddenly
Goes when the wind gently blows

And I'm asking nothing of you love
Only what you want to give
And I wish you what I wish myself
As long as I may live
Other arms will surely hold you
Just remember the things that I told you
When these arms of mine enfold you
It's not out of greed but for love
And for need

I love you so, I still do
I'm sure you know when I'm holding you
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye

Call and I'll come when your world's come undone
I'm like you, I get lonely too
And I need someone to hold
Knowing well this world can be hell
And sometimes very cold

Nothing firm and nothing binding
Now and then a slight reminding
Waking up one day and finding
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone
Oh babe, I'll be there, I'll be there anytime

There's a certain thing about you
Summer, fall and spring about you

And never run out, never run out (no)

431,Growin',"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest ""A Raisin in the Sun""
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I recommend that you read ""The Alchemist""
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up
Do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up

432,What Am I Gonna Do With You,"[Verse 1]
I guess I grew up a bit fast
New York can do you like that
I lie to myself when I'm bad
You get me like nobody has
I don’t even know what I want
And none of my friends fall in love
But you made me feel like the one
When I didn't feel like someone

You look at me some type of way
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
So tell me what I'm supposed to say though?

Don’t really wanna get played
Ugh, I hate that you're so beautiful

What am I, what am I, what am I gonna do with you?
When you look like that

What am I, what am I, what am I gonna do with you?
'Cause I'm holding back
'Cause I'm holding back
Damn, what I'm gonna do? Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling nervous as fuck
Take a couple of drinks so I’m drunk
Are you gonna do this or what?
You should be better at picking me up
Even though you’re a bit older than me
And I'm crushing so obviously
Make a move before you lose your buzz
So we can free fall into love

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
You look at me some type of way

So tell me what I’m supposed to say though?

433,Shaving Cream,"I have a sad story to tell you
It may hurt your feelings a bit
Last night when I walked into my bathroom
I stepped in a big pile of shhhhh-

-shaving cream
Be nice and clean
Shave every day and you'll always look keen

I think I'll break off with my girlfriend
Her antics are queer, I'll admit
Each time I say, ""Darling, I love you""
She tells me that I'm full of shhhhh-

-having cream
Be nice and clean
Shave every day and you'll always look keen

Our baby fell out of the window
You'd think that her head would be split
But good luck was with her that morning
She fell in a barrel of shhhhh-

-aving cream
Be nice and clean
Shave every day and you'll always look keen

My old lady died in a bathtub
She died from a terrible fit
In order to fulfill her wishes
She was buried in six feet of shh-

-having cream
Be nice and clean
Shave every day and you'll always look keen

When I was in France with the army
One day I looked into my kit
I thought I would find me a sandwich
But the darn thing was loaded with shh-

-having cream
Be nice and clean
Shave every day and you'll always look keen

And now folks my story is ended
I think it is time I should quit
If anyone of you feel offended
Stick your head in a barrel of sh-

Well I'm sittin' down in San Anton'
Waiting on an eight o'clock train

Things ain't been quite the same
I gotta get back to Dallas
And tie up a few loose ends
I'm gonna work a week make a hundred dollars
Aw and hit the road again

So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one
To leave me out here on my own
'Cause this ain't gonna be the first time

Well honey I've been a fool, but a bigger fool
I can't remember when I've been
Just to open up my heart
And let you walk right in
But there's one thing in life
That ain't hard for me to do
That's as soon as I kiss the lips of another woman
I'm gonna forget all about you

So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one

And let me pick one out
I don't believe there'd be one in the whole bunch

So I don't want you to think
That you're the first one

435,You Brought The Woman Out Of Me,"It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you

A perfect little lady
I think about her shiny golden hair
I've never been a dreamer but every time I see her
I start to float away into the air
Oh
Oh
My little lady

You can make the sun and moon begin to shine
And if you could have your way every day would be fine
It's no wonder for as long as I may live

I will give you all the love I am able to give

I wake up in the morning without a single warning
Before I finish yawning she is there
I think about my baby
A perfect little lady

Six feet down

Have you never tried
Just to get some comfort up inside?
Have you never been happy?

445,Real Man,"[Intro]
Shyea!

[Verse 1]
Residing in a town where weed is glorified
It was nothing, shit it wasn't weird to see some boys get high
See Ben used to burn some, but currently his turn was done
Anxiety left Ben regretting his first puff
But sure enough, he still hung with the same dudes
He was cool with this, 'cause you got a blunt he don't hate you
He's the youngin in they crew
But you'da never noticed and the dude that was the oldest was the coolest and the boldest
See everybody loved him 'cause they knew when he was rollin'
Through to meet the homies, it was soon that they'd be smokin
See he was the movement of the potent
QP's he'd be holdin and his new deals were the dopest
And him and Ben were tight
Even occasionally he spent the night, when he was locked out and couldn't get inside
He recognized Ben didn't smoke but this was something new
This gave him an idea that he'd bring up a few days later
The crew was rolling up some J papers
Taylor gang was playing, they exhaled in dazed anger
As the oldest one turns to Ben with hands hidden in his coat
Pulled out an O and said ""you ever think of flippin' bro?""

[Chorus]
Drugs, money, support, what else you need
Temporary money get that temporary self esteem
Drugs, money, support, just dont get brainwashed
Peer pressure doin its dang job, man whatchu talkin' bout
Let's get this money
Homie let's get this money
I gotta go yo I'mma get this money
Get out my face with your opinions, I got paper to be gettin' like a real man

[Verse 2]
He gave Ben his speech, seemin' almost memorized
All the attention in the room went to Ben's reply
He told Ben he got the heart it takes
The money hangin' out his pocket said let's start today
""Aye, you right homie
Matter fact I'm 'bout to blaze, take this plate
This chick by the bank say she need a slice homie
Have her take your number, tell her you're down with me
Dawg we bout to make a killing in this town, believe""
And how right he was
Ben didn't smoke his chronic so for the first time it was only profiting both they pockets
Ben begun to get addicted, the news spread quicker than Ben's temper if he didn't get money every twenty minutes
He single handedly changed the scene, so busy lying to his own mother became routine
But he loved it
He loved that they relied on him a fair amount
Came a long way from being the youngin no one cared about
They needed him now, so typical
No one expected little Ben to be sellin' shit, he felt invincible
And if he wasn't there was no reason to stress it
The oldest one gave him a knife, he said this is for protection
Ben had everything going for him...
A boss who had his back, a substance that always would attract
And the profit in a closet in the back
Pay no mind to the cops, until they caught him in the act when it was

[Chorus]
Drugs, money, support, what else you need
Temporary money get that temporary self esteem
Drugs, money, support, just dont get brainwashed
Peer pressure doin its dang job, man watchu talkin bout
Lets get this money
Homie lets get this money
I gotta go yo I'mma get this money
Get out my face with your opinions, i got paper to be gettin like a real man

[Verse 3]
Oh, you a man, huh?
In the police station, hands shakin, but actin like you dont give a damn, huh
Your mom pulls up in a van, covers her eyes with her hands and all you thinkin' is she dont understand, huh
Listen to that
You knew happy dont symbolize growth but a weak child fallin into a trap
I fiend for profit, deep involved in a loss of a stream of consciousness, all when hes too naive to watch and see the problem
Ignorance in a system pressured by peers
Holding a knife like your gonna use it, but you dread it with fear
Cause the moment you pullin out that, they pull out theirs
And youll be leakin more than just sweatin some tears
Ahead of your years? Sure, but you ain't do your job dude
You think you lost touch with your friends, they think they lost you
Little did you know, you were losing yourself
Now you gotta explain to your friends and family you were someone else when it was

[Chorus]
Drugs, money, support, what else you need
Temporary money get that temporary self esteem
Drugs, money, support, just dont get brainwashed
Peer pressure doin its dang job, man whatchu talkin bout
Let's this money
Homie let's get this money
I gotta go yo I'mma get this money
Get out my face with your opinions, I got paper to be gettin' like a real man",Token,1975,"[83, 84, 90]",3

We don't have to pay to be free

Would just let us be

We're in love with each other
If we ever want our freedom
We don't have to pay to be free

Shackin' up, shackin' up
It's better than being like
My next door neighboor
She's paying within

What's wrong with
Shackin' up, shackin' up

And feel the pounding
As your heart beats next to me

Filled with love the whole day through
And then tomorrow I'd beg
For one more tomorrow with you",Frankie Carle,1975,"[93, 95, 97]",3
449,Beer Barrel Polka/Dick And Jane,"I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.

—Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?

—Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?

—Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.

—What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.

—Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.

—Circumcised? says Joe.

—Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.

—That the lay you're on now? says Joe.

—Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?

For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.

—Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.

—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.

—What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.

—Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.

—Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.

—Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.

—Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.

—Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?

—Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.

—-What was that, Joe? says I.

—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.

So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.

In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.

And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.

I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!

And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.

So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.

—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.

The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.

—Stand and deliver, says he.

—That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.

—Pass, friends, says he.

Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:

—What's your opinion of the times?

Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.

—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.

So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:

—Foreign wars is the cause of it.

And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:

—It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.

—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.

—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.

—Wine of the country, says he.

—What's yours? says Joe.

—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.

—Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.

—Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?

And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.

The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.

He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.

So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.

—And there's more where that came from, says he.

—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.

—Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.

—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.

Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.

—For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.

And he starts reading them out:

—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...

—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.

—Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?

—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.

—I will, says he, honourable person.

—Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.

Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.

And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.

Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.

—Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...

And he doubled up.

—Take a what? says I.

—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.

—O hell! says I.

The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.

—Bi i dho husht, says he.

—Who? says Joe.

—Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.

—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.

—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?

—Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...

And he started laughing.

—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?

—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.

Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.

Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.

But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.

—What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?

—What's that? says Joe.

—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.

So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.

—Are you codding? says I.

—Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.

So Joe took up the letters.

—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.

So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:

—How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?

—I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...

—You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?

—With Dignam, says Alf.

—Is it Paddy? says Joe.

—Yes, says Alf. Why?

—Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.

—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.

—Ay, says Joe.

—Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.

—Who's dead? says Bob Doran.

—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.

—What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?

—What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?

—Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.

—Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.

—Paddy? says Alf.

—Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.

—Good Christ! says Alf.

Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.

In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.

Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.

He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.

—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.

—Who? says I.

—Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.

And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.

Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.

—Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.

And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:

—Who said Christ is good?

—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.

—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?

—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.

But Bob Doran shouts out of him.

—He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.

Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.

—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.

The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.

—The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.

And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.

Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.

—Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.

So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.

—O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?

And he starts reading out one.

7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.

Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...

—Show us, Joe, says I.

—... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...

—Jesus, says I.

—... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...

The citizen made a grab at the letter.

—Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.
H. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.

—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.

—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?

So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.

—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.

And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.

—They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.

And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.

In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.

So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.

—There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.

—What's that? says Joe.

—The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.

—That so? says Joe.

—God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in

Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.

—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.

—That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...

And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.

The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.

So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:

—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!

Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.

And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!

—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.

—Ay, ay, says Joe.

—You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...

—Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.

The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.

Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:

—God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.

So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.

So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.

—Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.

—No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.

So he calls the old dog over.

—What's on you, Garry? says he.

Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.

All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.

The curse of my curses
Seven days every day
And seven dry Thursdays
On you, Barney Kiernan,
Has no sup of water
To cool my courage,
And my guts red roaring
After Lowry's lights.

So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.

—I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.

Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:

—Could you make a hole in another pint?

—Could a swim duck? says I.

—Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.

—Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.

—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?

—Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.

—Whose admirers? says Joe.

—The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.

Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.

So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.

—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.

—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.

—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.

And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.

So Terry brought the three pints.

—Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.

—Slan leat, says he.

—Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.

Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.

—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.

—Friend of yours, says Alf.

—Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?

—I won't mention any names, says Alf.

—I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.

—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.

So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.

Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.

—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.

—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.

—Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.

—That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?

—Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.

Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?

Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.

Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.

Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)

Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.

Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.

(Ironical opposition cheers.)

The speaker: Order! Order!

(The house rises. Cheers.)

—There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?

—Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.

—Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.

—Is that really a fact? says Alf.

—Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?

So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.

Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?

—No, says Joe.

—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.

—Who? Blazes? says Joe.

And says Bloom:

—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.

—Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.

—We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.

—-True for you, says Joe.

And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:

—Now, don't you think, Bergan?

—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.

It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.

—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.

—He is, says Joe. Isn't he?

—Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.

—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.

—My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.

He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.

Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.

Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.

And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.

—Hello, Ned.

—Hello, Alf.

—Hello, Jack.

—Hello, Joe.

—God save you, says the citizen.

—Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?

—Half one, says Ned.

So J. J. ordered the drinks.

—Were you round at the court? says Joe.

—Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.

—Hope so, says Ned.

Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.

—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.

—Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.

—Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.

—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.

—Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.

—Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.

—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.

—Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.

—Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.

—Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.

—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.

—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.

—Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.

—How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...

—Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.

—Nor good red herring, says Joe.

—That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.

Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.

—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.

Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.

—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.

—Good health, Ned, says J. J.

—-There he is again, says Joe.

—Where? says Alf.

And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.

—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.

—Remanded, says J. J.

One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.

—Who tried the case? says Joe.

—Recorder, says Ned.

—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.

—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.

—Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.

And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:

—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?

—Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.

—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.

And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.

—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.

So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.

—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.

—Rely on me, says Joe.

—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.

—O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.

—Consider that done, says Joe.

—Very kind of you, says Bloom.

—The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.

—Decree nisi, says J. J.

And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.

—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.

—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.

—Give us a squint at her, says I.

And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.

—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!

—There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?

So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.

—Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?

O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.

—It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.

So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.

—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.

—The European family, says J. J....

—They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.

And says John Wyse:

—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.

And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:

—Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!

He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.

—What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.

—Gold cup, says he.

—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.

—Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.

—And Bass's mare? says Terry.

—Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.

—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.

—Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.

So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.

—Not there, my child, says he.

—Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.

And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.

—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.

—Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?

—As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...

—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.

—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.

The fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.

—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.

—And will again, says Joe.

—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.

And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.

—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?

—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.

—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?

—Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.

Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.

—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?

—I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.

So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.

—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.

And says John Wyse:

—'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.

Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.

—That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.

The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.

—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.

—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.

They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.

—But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?

Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.

—We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.

—Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...

—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.

—Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?

—The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.

—Conspuez les Français, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.

—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?

Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.

—Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.

—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!

—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.

—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.

And says J. J.:

—Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.

—Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.

—Yes, sir, says he. I will.

—You? says Joe.

—Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.

—Repeat that dose, says Joe.

Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.

—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.

—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.

—Yes, says Bloom.

—What is it? says John Wyse.

—A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.

—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.

So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:

—Or also living in different places.

—That covers my case, says Joe.

—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.

—Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.

The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.

—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.

—Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.

The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.

—Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?

—That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.

—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.

Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.

—Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.

—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.

—I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.

—Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.

That's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.

—But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.

—What? says Alf.

—Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.

Who's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.

—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.

—Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.

—That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.

Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.

—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.

—Hurrah, there, says Joe.

—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.

And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.

—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?

—What's that? says Joe.

So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:

—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.

—Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.

—Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.

—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.

—No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.

—And a very good initial too, says Joe.

—That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.

—Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?

—Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.

—Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.

—I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.

—Who? says I.

—Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.

—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?

—That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.

—He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.

—Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.

—There you are, says Terry.

Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.

So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.

—Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.

Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.

Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.

—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!

So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.

Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.

—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.

—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.

—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.

—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?

An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.

—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.

—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?

Mine host bowed again as he made answer:

—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?

—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!

—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.

So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.

—Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.

—Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?

—That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.

—Who made those allegations? says Alf.

—I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.

—And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?

—Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.

—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.

—Who is Junius? says J. J.

—We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.

—He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.

—Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.

—Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.

—That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!

—Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.

—Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.

—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.

—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.

—En ventre sa mère, says J. J.

—Do you call that a man? says the citizen.

—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.

—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.

—And who does he suspect? says the citizen.

Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.

—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.

—A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.

—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.

—Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.

—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.

—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.

—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.

—Amen, says the citizen.

—And I'm sure He will, says Joe.

And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.

—Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.

—Qui fecit coelum et terram.

—Dominus vobiscum.

—Et cum spiritu tuo.

And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:

—Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.

—And so say all of us, says Jack.

—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.

—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.

I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.

—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...

—No, says Martin, we're ready.

Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.

—Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,

—Beg your pardon, says he.

—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.

—Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.

And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.

—Bye bye all, says Martin.

And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.

—-Off with you, says

Martin to the jarvey.

The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.

But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.

—Let me alone, says he.

And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:

—Three cheers for Israel!

Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.

And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:

—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!

And says he:

—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.

—He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.

—Whose God? says the citizen.

—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.

Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.

—By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.

By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.

—Stop! Stop! says Joe.

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great éclat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontlátásra, kedves baráton! Visszontlátásra! Gone but not forgotten.

Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:

—Where is he till I murder him?

And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.

—Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.

But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.

—Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!

Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.

The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of débris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.

—Did I kill him, says he, or what?

And he shouting to the bloody dog:

—After him, Garry! After him, boy!

And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.

When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.",James Joyce,1975,"[95, 52, 33, 33, 42, 52, 63, 75, 86]",9

Remembers one beautiful day
Every girl past her prime
Knows the date and the time
She looked most exquisite
And she will revisit
Revisit
Revisit that day
Her most beautiful day
For the rest of her life

My most beautiful day
Pa took me dancing
And everything fell into place
My hair tied like so
With a blackberry bow
A night in November
Then I will remember
Remember
Remember that day
My most beautiful day
For the rest of my life

Each memory
A sweet melody
Your heart clings too
With each passing day
What time takes a way
Your heart makes new
Looking back
Looking back is something to look forward to
Your most beautiful day
For the rest of your life

453,You Are So Beautiful/It's A Sin When You Love Somebody,"[Verse 1]
I used to party with the Betties on the lower east side
Never drop top forty cause I always rock b-sides
G-rides with a hundred spokes to match
We roll two deep...three freaks...four amps in the back
I kicked that crack game rap game now I let my axe bang
Livin' in sin and it's a beautiful thing
I wanna twang like Hank...rock like Run
Got soul like Stevie when I'm under the sun and so

Somebody's gotta feel this
Someone's got to feel this
Somebody's gotta feel this
Someone's got to feel this
Somebody's gotta feel this
Someone's got to feel this

[Verse 2]
I never had a lot of money, never made much sense
Been chasin' bunnies like a dummy overlookin' my rent
He spent every rent cent puttin' hickeys on his bed
He's rockin' dickie's slippin lickin' honey's steady
Lookin' for love I put my talent on hold
Told my soul to glow it said get up and go
And so I packed my bags with a whole lot of realness

(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this
(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this
(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this

[Verse 3]
I see these people makin' money and it's funny to me
Tryin' to act that fresh I wish they'd bump into me
Cause it ain't nothing to me want to eat a little more
Taste a little bit pride from every drink that I pour
I've been a whore for years showing love to my peers
Never sold for any less than what I see in the mirror
Steer wide to avoid the blows I've been dealt
Let the six strings ride when the twelves are felt
So when you see me tuggin' on the end of my roap
You better raise up or duck when I reach in my coat because

(Somebody's gotta feel this)
(Somebody's gotta feel this)

454,Express,"[Intro]
Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel

[Chorus]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...

[Chorus]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

459,(if You Add) All The Love In The World,"If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over

Take away all the times that you don't
There'll still be some love left over

If you've got a plan for living, man
You better get things moving
Or you'll be losing your way to freedom

And some people tell the world about love
And others just say nothing
Me, I just stay in between
Cause I know

If you add all the love in the world
Take away the hate and the pain
There'll still be some love left over
There'll still be some love left over

And if you add all the times that you heal
And take away all the times that you don't

'Til we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you

How warm and tender we were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend

470,Tangled Up In Blue,"(Dylan)

Early one morning the sun was shining i was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all if her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together sure was going to be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And i was standing on the side of the road rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the east coast lord knows i've paid some dues getting through
Tangled up in blue
She was married when we first met soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam i guess but i used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could abandoned it out west
Split up on a dark sad night both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me as i was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder ""we'll meet again some day on the avenue""
Tangled up in blue
I had a job in the great north woods working as a cook for a spell
I never did like it all that much and one day the axe just fell
So i drifted down to new orleans where i was lucky to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of delacroix
But all the while i was alone the past was close behind
I seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and i just grew
Tangled up in blue
She was working in a topless place and i stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear
And later on the crowd thinned out i was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair saying ""jackie don't i know your name?""
I muttered something underneath my breath she studied the lines on my face
I must admit i felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""i thought you'd never say hello"" she said ""you look like the silent type""
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me
Written by an italian poet from the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coals
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on montague street in a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside
And one day finally the bottom fell out and i became withdrawn
The only thing i knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now i'm going back again i got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know they're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started i don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me i'm still on the road heading for another joint
We always did feel the same we just saw it from a different point of view

471,Cry To Me,"(Intro)
Sometimes it's so hard to be happy.
When all you do is hold on to your insecurities.
The hurting heart is the most painful.
So let it all out then, oh cry.

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

(Verse 1)
When will you emerge from your hideaway?
From natural feelings that you won't escape.
Maybe it's my mind drifting too far into space.
And fly away to a better place.
But there's no other spot I'd rather lay.
So don't be scared, no, I won't hurt you (so cry).

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

(Bridge)
We're better together in any weather.
If you're cold I'm your sweater.
If it rains I'm your umbrella.
No is one perfect, but to me you're perfection.
What are flaws besides they're creation?
You're gunna walk through the heartaches, walk through the pain.
Don't feel alone in the shadow.
You're not the one to blame.
So if I could just ease your mind to see what you should be or to look and to watch and what to believe is real.
Let it all go, it will make you feel better.
So drop it all and cry to me if you want to.

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
Fine, it's fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside (inside).

Why, was't not rare?

KNOW
Yes, I'll be sworn, I was ne'er guilty of reading the
like; match it in all Pliny, or Symmachus's epistles, and I'll have
my judgment burn'd in the ear for a rogue: make much of thy vein,
for it is inimitable. But I marle what camel it was, that had the
carriage of it; for, doubtless, he was no ordinary beast that

And I fewer, sir; I have scarce enough to thank you.

MAT
But are you, indeed, sir, so given to it?

STEP
Ay, truly, sir, I am mightily given to melancholy.

MAT
Oh, it's your only fine humour, sir: your true melancholy
breeds your perfect fine wit, sir. I am melancholy myself, diver
times, sir, and then do I no more but take pen and paper,
presently, and overflow you half a score, or a dozen of sonnets at
a sitting.

KNOW
Sure he utters them then by the gross. [Aside.

STEP
Truly, sir, and I love such things out of measure.

KNOW
I'faith, better than in measure, I'll undertake.

MAT
Why, I pray you, sir, make use of my study, it's at your
service.

STEP
I thank you, sir, I shall be bold I warrant you; have you a
stool there to be melancholy upon?

MAT
That I have, sir, and some papers there of mine own doing, at
idle hours, that you'll say there's some sparks of wit in 'em, when
you see them,

WEL
Would the sparks would kindle once, and become a fire amongst
them! I might see self-love burnt for her heresy. [Aside.

STEP
Cousin, is it well? am I melancholy enough?

KNOW
Oh ay, excellent.

WEL
Captain Bobadill, why muse you so?


KNOW
He is melancholy too.

BOB
Faith, sir, I was thinking of a most honourable piece of
service, was performed to-morrow, being St. Mark's day, shall be
some ten years now.

KNOW
In what place, captain?

BOB
Why, at the beleaguering of Strigonium, where, in less than
two hours, seven hundred resolute gentlemen, as any were in Europe,
lost their lives upon the breach. I'll tell you, gentlemen, it was
the first, but the best leaguer that ever I beheld with these eyes,
except the taking in of—what do you call it?—last year, by the
Genoways; but that, of all other, was the most fatal and dangerous
exploit that ever I was ranged in, since I first bore arms before
the face of the enemy, as I am a gentleman and a soldier!

STEP
So! I had as lief as an angel I could swear as well as that
gentleman.

KNOW
Then, you were a servitor at both, it seems; at
Strigonium, and what do you call't?

BOB
O lord, sir! By St. George, I was the first man that entered
the breach; and had I not effected it with resolution, I had been
slain if I had had a million of lives.

KNOW
'Twas pity you had not ten; a cat's and your own, i'faith.
But, was it possible?

MAT
Pray you mark this discourse, sir.

STEP
So I do.

BOB
I assure' you, upon my reputation, 'tis true, and you shall
confess.

KNOW
You must bring me to the rack, first.
Aside.

BOB
Observe me judicially, sweet sir; they had planted me three
demi-culverins just in the mouth of the breach; now, sir, as we
were to give on, their master-gunner (a man of no mean skill and
mark, you must think,) confronts me with his linstock, ready to
give fire; I, spying his intendment, discharged my petronel in his
bosom, and with these single arms, my poor rapier, ran violently
upon the Moors that guarded the ordnance, and put them pell-mell,
to the sword.

WEL
To the sword! To the rapier, captain.

KNOW
Oh, it was a good figure observed, sir: but did you all
this, captain, without hurting your blade?

BOB
Without any impeach O' the earth: you shall perceive, sir.
[Shews his rapier.] It is the most fortunate weapon that ever rid
on poor gentleman's thigh. Shall I tell you, sir? You talk of
Morglay, Excalibur, Durindana, or so; tut! I lend no credit to that
is fabled of 'em: I know the virtue of mine own, and therefore I
dare the boldlier maintain it.

STEP
I marle whether it be a Toledo or no.

BOB
A most perfect Toledo, I assure you, sir. Step. I have a
countryman of his here.

MAT
Pray you, let's see, sir; yes, faith, it is.

BOB
This a Toledo! Pish!

STEP
Why do you pish, captain?

BOB
A Fleming, by heaven! I'll buy them for a guilder a-piece. An
I would have a thousand of them.

KNOW
How say you, cousin? I told you thus much.

WEL
Where bought you it, master Stephen?

STEP
Of a scurvy rogue soldier: a hundred of lice go with him! He
swore it was a Toledo.

BOB
A poor provant rapier, no better.

MAT
Mass, I think it be indeed, now I look on't better.

KNOW
Nay, the longer you look on't, the worse. Put it up, put
it up.

STEP
Well, I will put it up; but by—I have forgot the captain's
oath, I thought to have sword! by it,—an e'er I meet him—

WEL
O, it is past help now, sir; you must have patience.

STEP
Whoreson, coney-hatching rascal! I could eat the very hilts
for anger.

KNOW
A sign of good digestion; you have an ostrich stomach,
Cousin.

STEP
A stomach! would I had him here, you should see an I had a
stomach.

WEL
It's better as it is.—Come, gentlemen, shall we go?

Enter BRAINWORM, disguised as before.

KNOW
A miracle, cousin; look here, look here!

STEP
Oh—'Od's lid. By your leave, do you know me, sir?

BRAI
Ay, sir, I know you by sight.

Step
You sold me a rapier, did you not?

BRAI
Yes, marry did I, sir.

STEP
You said it was a Toledo, ha?

BRAI
True, I did so.

STEP
But it is none.

BRAI
No, sir, I confess it; it is none.

STEP
Do you confess it? Gentlemen, bear witness, he has confest
it:—'Od's will, an you had not confest it.===

KNOW
Oh, cousin, forbear, forbear! Step. Nay, I have done,
cousin.

WEL
Why, you have done like a gentleman; he has confest it, what
would you more?

STEP
Yet, by his leave, he is a rascal, under his favour, do you
see.

KNOW
Ay, by his leave, he is, and under favour: a pretty piece
of civility! Sirrah, how dost thou like him?

WEL
Oh, it's a most precious fool, make much on him: I can compare
him to nothing more happily than a drum; for every one may play
upon him.

KNOW
No, no, a child's whistle were far the fitter.

BRAI
Shall I intreat a word with you?

KNOW
With me, sir? you have not another Toledo to sell, have
you?

BRAI
You are conceited, sir: Your name is Master Knowell, as I
take it?

You are in the right; you mean not to proceed in the
catechism, do you?

BRAI
No, sir; I am none of that coat.

KNOW
Of as bare a coat, though: well, say, sir.

BRAI
Faith, sir, I am but servant to the
drum extraordinary, and indeed, this smoky varnish being washed
off, and three or four patches removed, I appear your worship's in
reversion, after the decease of your good father, Brainworm.

KNOW
Brainworm'! 'Slight, what breath of a conjurer hath blown
thee hither in this shape?

BRAI
The breath of your letter, sir, this morning; the same that
blew you to the Windmill, and your father after you.

KNOW
My father!

BRAI
Nay, never start, 'tis true; he has followed you over the
fields by the foot, as you would do a hare in the snow.

KNOW
Sirrah Wellbred, what shall we do, sirrah? my father is
come over after me.

WEL
Thy father! Where is he?

BRAI
At justice Clement's house, in Coleman-street, where he but
stays my return; and then—

WEL
Who's this? Brainworm!

BRAI
The same, sir.

WEL
Why how, in the name of wit, com'st thou transmuted thus?

COB
Faith, a device, a device; nay, for the love of reason,
gentlemen, and avoiding the danger, stand not here; withdraw, and
I'll tell you all.

WEL
But art thou sure he will stay thy return?

BRAI
Do I live, sir? what a question is that!

WEL
We'll prorogue his expectation, then, a little: Brainworm,
thou shalt go with us.—Come on, gentlemen.==-Nay, I pray thee,
sweet Ned, droop not; 'heart, an our wits be so wretchedly dull,
that one old plodding brain can outstrip us all, would we were e'en
prest to make porters of, and serve out the remnant of our days in
Thames-street, or at Custom-house key, in a civil war against the
carmen!

BRAI
Amen, amen, amen, say I.

SCENE II—-The Old Jewry. KITELY'S Warehouse.
Enter KITELY and CASH.

KIT
What says he, Thomas? did you speak with him?

CASH
He will expect you, sir, within this half hour.

KIT
Has he the money ready, can you tell?

CASH
Yes, sir, the money was brought in last night.

KIT
O, that is well; fetch me my cloak, my cloak![Exit Cash.]
Stay, let me see, an hour to go and come;
Ay, that will be the least; and then 'twill be
An hour before I can dispatch with him,
Or very near; well, I will say two hours.
Two hours! ha! things never dreamt of yet,
May be contrived, ay, and effected too,
In two hours' absence; well, I will not go.
Two hours! No, fleering Opportunity,
I will not give your subtilty that scope.
Who will not judge him worthy to be robb'd,
That sets his doors wide open to a thief,
And shews the felon where his treasure lies?
Again, what earthly spirit but will attempt
To taste the fruit of beauty's golden tree,
When leaden sleep seals up the dragon's eyes?
I will not go. Business, go by for once.
No, beauty, no; you are of too good caract,
To be left so, without a guard, or open,
Your lustre, too, 'll inflame at any distance,
Draw courtship to you, as a jet doth straws;
Put motion in a stone, strike fire from ice,
Nay, make a porter leap you with his burden.
You must be then kept up, close, and well watch'd,
For, give you opportunity, no quick-sand
Devours or swallows swifter! He that lends
His wife, if she be fair, or time or place,
Compels her to be false. I will not go!
The dangers are too many;—-and then the dressing
Is a most main attractive! Our great heads
Within this city never were in safety
Since our wives wore these little caps: I'll change 'em;
I'll change 'em straight in mine: mine shall no more
Wear three-piled acorns, to make my horns ake.
Nor will I go; I am resolved for that.
Re-enter CASH with a cloak.
Carry in my cloak again. Yet stay. Yet do, too:
I will defer going, on all occasions.

CASH
Sir, Snare, your scrivener, will be there with the bonds.

KIT
That's true: fool on me! I had clean forgot it;
I must go. What's a clock?

CASH
Exchange-time, sir.

KIT
'Heart, then will Wellbred presently be here too,
With one or other of his loose consorts.
I am a knave, if I know what to say,
What course to take, or which way to resolve.
My brain, methinks, is like an hour-glass,
Wherein my imaginations run like sands,
Filling up time; but then are turn'd and turn'd:
So that I know not what to stay upon,
And less, to put in act.—-It shall be so.
Nay, I dare build upon his secrecy,
He knows not to deceive me.—-Thomas!

CASH
Sir.

KIT
Yet now I have bethought me too, I will not.
Thomas, is Cob within?

CASH
I think he be, sir.

KIT
But he'll prate too, there is no speech of him.
No, there were no man on the earth to Thomas,
If I durst trust him; there is all the doubt.
But should he have a clink in him, I were gone.
Lost in my fame for ever, talk for th' Exchange!
The manner he hath stood with, till this present,
Doth promise no such change: what should I fear then?
Well, come what will, I'll tempt my fortune once.

THOMAS
you may deceive me, but, I hope
Your love to me is more

CASH
Sir, if a servant's
Duty, with faith, may be call'd love, you are
More than in hope, you are possess'd of it.

KIT
I thank you heartily, Thomas: give me your hand:
With all my heart, good Thomas. I have, Thomas,
A secret to impart unto you—-but,
When once you have it, I must seal your lips up;
So far I tell you, Thomas.

CASH
Sir, for that

KIT
Nay, hear me out. Think I esteem you, Thomas,
When I will let you in thus to my private.
It is a thing sits nearer to my crest,
Than thou art 'ware of, Thomas; if thou should'st
Reveal it, but

CASH
How, I reveal it?

KIT
Nay,
I do not think thou would'st; but if thou should'st,
'Twere a great weakness.

CASH
A great treachery:
Give it no other name.

KIT
Thou wilt not do't, then?

CASH
Sir, if I do, mankind disclaim me ever!

KIT
He will not swear, he has some reservation,
Some conceal'd purpose, and close meaning sure;
Else, being urg'd so much, how should he choose
But lend an oath to all this protestation?
He's no precisian, that I'm certain of,
Nor rigid Roman Catholic: he'll play
At fayles, and tick-tack; I have heard him swear.
What should I think of it? urge him again,
And by some other way! I will do so.
Well, Thomas, thou hast sworn not to disclose:—-
Yes, you did swear?

CASH
Not yet, sir, but I will,
Please you

KIT
No, Thomas, I dare take thy word,
But, if thou wilt swear, do as thou think'st; good;
I am resolv'd without It; at thy pleasure.

CASH
By my soul's safety then, sir, I protest,
My tongue shall ne'er take knowledge of a word
Deliver'd me in nature of your trust.

KIT
It is too much; these ceremonies need not:
I know thy faith to be as firm as rock.
Thomas, come hither, near; we cannot be
Too private in this business. So it is,
Now he has sworn, I dare the safelier venture. [Aside.]
I have of late, by divers observations
But whether his oath can bind him, yea, or no,
Being not taken lawfully? ha! say you?
I will ask council ere I do proceed [Aside.]
Thomas, it will be now too long to stay,
I'll spy some fitter time soon, or to-morrow.

CASH
Sir, at your pleasure.

KIT
I will think:-and, Thomas,
I pray you search the books 'gainst my return,
For the receipts 'twixt me and Traps.

CASH
I will, sir.

KIT
And hear you, if your mistress's brother, Wellbred,
Chance to bring hither any gentleman,
Ere I come back, let one straight bring me word.

CASH
Very well, sir.

KIT
To the Exchange, do you hear?
Or here in Coleman-street, to justice Clement's.
Forget it not, nor be not out of the way.

CASH
I will not, sir.

KIT
I pray you have a care on't.
Or, whether he come or no, if any other,
Stranger, or else; fail not to send me word.

CASH
I shall not, sir.

KIT
Be it your special business
Now to remember it.

CASH
Sir, I warrant you.

KIT
But, Thomas, this is not the secret, Thomas,
I told you of.

CASH
No, sir; I do suppose it.

KIT
Believe me, it is not.

CASH
Sir, I do believe you.

KIT
By heaven it is not, that's enough: but, Thomas,
I would not you should utter it, do you see,
To any creature living; yet I care not.
Well, I must hence. Thomas, conceive thus much;
It was a trial of you, when I meant
So deep a secret to you, I mean not this,
But that I have to tell you; this is nothing, this.
But, Thomas, keep this from my wife, I charge you,
Lock'd up in silence, midnight, buried here.
No greater hell than to be slave to fear.

CASH
Lock'd up in silence, midnight, buried here!
Whence should this flood of passion, trow, take head? ha!
Best dream no longer of this running humour,
For fear I sink; the violence of the stream
Already hath transported me so far,
That I can feel no ground at all: but soft
Oh, 'tis our water-bearer: somewhat has crost him now.
Enter COB, hastily.

COB
Fasting-days! what tell you me of fasting days? 'Slid, would
they were all on a light fire for me! they say the whole world
shall be consumed with fire one day, but would I had these
Ember-weeks and villanous Fridays burnt in the mean time, and
then

CASH
Why, how now, Cob? what moves thee to this choler, ha?

COB
Collar, master Thomas! I scorn your collar, I, sir; I am none
O' your cart-horse, though I carry and draw water. An you offer to
ride me with your collar or halter either, I may hap shew you a
jade's trick, sir.

CASH
O, you'll slip your head out of the collar? why, goodman Cob,
you mistake me.

COB
Nay, I have my rheum, and I can be angry as well as another,
sir.

CASH
Thy rheum, Cob! thy humour, thy humour—thou misstak'st.

COB
Humour! mack, I think it be so indeed; what is that humour?
some rare thing, I warrant.

CASH
Marry I'll tell thee, Cob: it is a gentlemanlike monster,
bred in the special gallantry of our time, by affectation; and fed
by folly.

COB
How! must it be fed?

CASH
Oh ay, humour is nothing if it be not fed: didst thou never
hear that? it's a common phrase, feed my humour.

COB
I'll none on it: humour, avaunt! I know you not, be gone! let
who will make hungry meals for your monstership, it shall not be I.
Feed you, quoth he! 'slid, I have much ado to feed myself;
especially on these lean rascally days too; an't had been any other
day but a fasting-day—a plague on them all for me! By this light,
one might have done the commonwealth good service, and have drown'd
them all in the flood, two or three hundred thousand years ago. O,
I do stomach them hugely. I have a maw now, and 'twere for sir
Bevis his horse, against them.

CASH
I pray thee, good Cob, what makes thee so out of love with
fasting days?

COB
Marry, that which will make any man out of love with 'em, I
think; their bad conditions, an you will needs know. First they are
of a Flemish breed, I am sure on't, for they raven up more butter
than all the days of the week beside; next, they stink of fish and
leek-porridge miserably; thirdly, they'll keep a man devoutly
hungry all day, and at night send him supperless to bed.

CASH
Indeed, these are faults, Cob.

COB
Nay, an this were all, 'twere something; but they are the only
known enemies to my generation. A fasting-day no sooner comes, but
my lineage goes to wrack; poor cobs! they smoak for it, they are
made martyrs O' the gridiron, they melt in passion: and your maids
to know this, and yet would have me turn Hannibal, and eat my own
flesh and blood. My princely coz, [pulls out a red herring] fear
nothing; I have not the heart to devour you, an I might be made as
rich as king Cophetua. O that I had room for my tears, I could weep
salt-water enough now to preserve the lives of ten thousand
thousand of my kin! But I may curse none but these filthy
almanacks; for an't were not for them, these days of persecution
would never be known. I'll be hang'd an some fish-monger's son do
not make of 'em, and puts in more fasting-days than he should do,
because he would utter his father's dried stock—fish and stinking
conger.

CASH
'Slight peace! thou'lt be beaten like a stock-fish else:
here's master Mathew.

Enter WELLIBRED, E. KNOWELL, BRAINWORM,
MATHEW, BOBADILL, and STEPHEN.
Now must I look out for a messenger to my master.

WEL
Beshrew me, but it was an absolute good jest, and exceedingly
well carried!

KNOW
Ay, and our ignorance maintain'd it as well, did it not?

WEL
Yes, faith; but was it possible thou shouldst not know him? I
forgive master Stephen, for he is stupidity itself.

KNOW
'Fore God, not I, an I might have been join'd patten with
one of the seven wise masters for knowing him. He had so writhen
himself into the habit of one of your poor infantry, your decayed;
ruinous, worm-eaten gentlemen of the round; such as have vowed to
sit on the skirts of the city, let your provost and his half-dozen
of halberdiers do what they can; and have translated begging out of
the old hackney-pace to a fine easy amble, and made it run as
smooth off the tongue as a shove-groat shilling. Into the likeness
of one of these reformados had he moulded himself so perfectly,
observing every trick of their action, as, varying the accent,
swearing with an emphasis, indeed, all with so special and
exquisite a grace, that, hadst thou seen him, thou wouldst have
sworn he might have been sergeant-major, if not lieutenant-colonel
to the regiment.

WEL
Why, Brainworm, who would have thought thou hadst been such an
artificer?

KNOW
An artificer! an architect. Except a man had studied
begging all his life time, and been a weaver of language from his
infancy for the cloathing of it, I never saw his rival.

WEL
Where got'st thou this coat, I marle?

BRAI
Of a Hounsditch man, sir, one of the devil's near kinsmen, a
broker.

WEL
That cannot be, if the proverb hold; for 'A crafty knave needs
no broker.'

BRAI
True, sir; but I did need a broker, ergo—

WEL
Well put off:—no crafty knave, you'll say.

KNOW
Tut, he has more of these shifts.

BRAI
And yet, where I have one the broker has ten, sir.
Reenter CASH

CASH
Francis! Martin! ne'er a one to be found now? what a spite's
this!

WEL
How now, Thomas? Is my brother Kitely within?

CASH
No, sir, my master went forth e'en now; but master Downright
is within.—Cob! what, Cob! Is he gone too?

WEL
Whither went your master, Thomas, canst thou tell?

CASH
I know not: to justice Clement's, I think, sir—Cob!

KNOW
Justice Clement! what's he?

WEL
Why, dost thou not know him? He is a city-magistrate, a justice
here, an excellent good lawyer, and a great scholar; but the only
mad, merry old fellow in Europe. I shewed him you the other day.

KNOW
Oh, is that he? I remember him now. Good faith, and he is
a very strange presence methinks; it shews as if he stood out of
the rank from other men: I have heard many of his jests in the
University. They say he will commit a man for taking the wall of
his horse.

WEL
Ay, or wearing his cloak on one shoulder, or serving of God;
any thing, indeed, if it come in the way of his humour.

Re-enter CASH.

Cash
Gasper! Martin! Cob! 'Heart, where should they be trow?

Bob
Master Kitely's man, pray thee vouchsafe us the lighting of
this match.

CASH
Fire on your match! no time but now to vouchsafe?—Francis!
Cob!

BOB
Body O' me! here's the remainder of seven pound since
yesterday was seven-night. 'Tis your right Trinidado: did you never
take any master Stephen?

STEP
No, truly, sir; but I'll learn to take it now, since you
commend it so.

BOB
Sir, believe me, upon my relation for what I tell you, the
world shall not reprove. I have been in the Indies, where this herb
grows, where neither myself, nor a dozen gentlemen more of my
knowledge, have received the taste of any other nutriment in the
world, for the space of one and twenty weeks, but the fume of this
simple only: therefore, it cannot be, but 'tis most divine.
Further, take it in the nature, in the true kind; so, it makes an
antidote, that, had you taken the most deadly poisonous plant in
all Italy, it should expel it, and clarify you, with as much ease
as I speak. And for your green wound,—your Balsamum and your St.
John's wort, are all mere gulleries and trash to it, especially
your Trinidado: your Nicotian is good too. I could say what I know
of the virtue of it, for the expulsion of rheums, raw humours,
crudities, obstructions, with a thousand of this kind; but I
profess myself no quack-salver. Only thus much; by Hercules, I do
hold it, and will affirm it before any prince in Europe, to be the
most sovereign and precious weed that ever the earth tendered to
the use of man.

KNOW
This speech would have done decently in a tobacco-trader's
mouth.

Re-enter CASH with COB.

CASH
At justice Clement's he is, in the middle of Coleman-street.

COB
Oh, oh!

BOB
Where's the match I gave thee, master Kitely's man?

CASH
Would his match and he, and pipe and all, were at Sancto
Domingo! I had forgot it.

COB
'Od's me, I marle what pleasure or felicity they have in
taking this roguish tobacco. It's good for nothing but to choke a
man, and fill him full of smoke and embers: there were four died
out of one house last week with taking of it, and two more the bell
went for yesternight; one of them, they say, will never scape it;
he voided a bushel of soot yesterday, upward and downward. By the
stocks, an there were no wiser men than I, I'd have it present
whipping, man or woman, that should but deal with a tobacco pipe:
why, it will stifle them all in the end, as many as use it; it's
little better than ratsbane or rosaker.
[Bobadill beats him.]

All
Oh, good captain, hold, hold!

BOB
You base cullion, you!
Re-enter CASH.

CASH
Sir, here's your match. Come, thou must needs be talking too,
thou'rt well enough served.

COB
Nay, he will not meddle with his match, I warrant you: well,
it shall be a dear beating, an I live.

BOB
Do you prate, do you murmur?

KNOW
Nay, good captain, will you regard the humour of a fool?
Away, knave.

WEL
Thomas, get him away. [Exit Cash with Cob.

BOB
A whoreson filthy slave, a dung-worm, an excrement! Body O'
Caesar, but that I scorn to let forth so mean a spirit, I'd have
stabb'd him to the earth.

WEL
Marry, the law forbid, sir!

BOB
By Pharaoh's foot, I would have done it.

STEP
Oh, he swears most admirably! By Pharaoh's foot! Body O'
Caesar!—I shall never do it, sure. Upon mine honour, and by St.
George!—No, I have not the right grace.

MAT
Master Stephen, will you any? By this air, the most divine
tobacco that ever I drunk.
As I am a gentleman!

STEP
None, I thank you, sir. O, this gentleman does it rarely,
too: but nothing like the other. By this air!

BRAI
[pointing to Master Stephen.] Master, glance, glance! master
Wellbred!

STEP
As I have somewhat to be saved, I protest—

WEL
You are a fool; it needs no affidavit.

KNOW
Cousin, will you any tobacco?

STEP
I, sir! Upon my reputation—

KNOW
How now, cousin!

STEP
I protest, as I am a gentleman, but no soldier, indeed—

WEL
No, master Stephen! As I remember, your name is entered in the
artillery-garden.

STEP
Ay, sir, that's true. Cousin, may I swear, as I am a soldier,
by that?

KNOW
O yes, that you may; it is all you have for your money.

STEP
Then, as I am a gentleman, and a soldier, it is ""divine
tobacco!""

WEL
But soft, where's master Mathew! Gone?

BRAI
No, sir; they went in here.

WEL
O let's follow them: master Mathew is gone to salute his
mistress in verse; we shall have the happiness to hear some of his
poetry now; he never comes unfinished.—Brainworm!

STEP
Brainworm! Where? Is this Brainworm?

KNOW
Ay, cousin; no words of it, upon your gentility.

STEP
Not I, body of me! By this air! St. George! and the foot of
Pharaoh!

WEL
Rare! Your cousin's discourse is simply drawn out with oaths.

KNOW
'Tis larded with them; a kind of French dressing, if you
love it.

SCENE III-Coleman-Street. A Room in Justice CLEMENT'S House.
Enter KITELY and COB.

KIT
Ha! how many are there, say'st thou?

COB
Marry, sir, your brother, master Wellbred—

KIT
Tut, beside him: what strangers are there, man?

COB
Strangers? let me see, one, two; mass; I know not well,—
there are so many.

KIT
How! so many?

COB
Ay, there's some five or six of them at the most.

KIT
A swarm, a swarm!
Spite of the devil...how they sting my head
With forked stings, thus wide and large!
But, Cob, How long hast thou been coming hither, Cob?

COB
A little while, sir.

KIT
Didst thou come running?

COB
No, sir.

KIT
Nay, then I am familiar with thy haste.
Bane to my fortunes! what meant I to marry?
I, that before was rank'd in such content,
My mind at rest too, in so soft a peace,
Being free master of mine own free thoughts,
And now become a slave? What! never sigh;
Be of good cheer, man; for thou art a cuckold:
'Tis done, 'tis done! Nay, when such flowing-store,
Plenty itself, falls into my wife's lap,
The cornucopiae will be mine, I know.—But, Cob,
What entertainment had they? I am sure
My sister and my wife would bid them welcome: ha?

COB
Like enough, sir; yet I heard not a word of it.

KIT
No;
Their lips were seal'd with kisses, and the voice,
Drown'd in a flood of joy at their arrival,
Had lost her motion, state and faculty.

COB
Which of them was it that first kiss'd my wife,
My sister, I should say?—My wife, alas!
I fear not her: ha! who was it say'st thou?

COB
By my troth, sir, will you have the truth of it?

KIT
Oh, ay, good Cob, I pray thee heartily.

COB
Then I am a vagabond, and fitter for Bridewell than your
worship's company, if I saw any body to be kiss'd, unless they
would have kiss'd the post in the middle of the warehouse; for
there I left them all at their tobacco, with a pox!

KIT
How! were they not gone in then ere thou cam'st?

COB
O no, sir.

KOB
Spite of the devil! what do I stay here then? Cob, follow me.
[Exit.]

COB
Nay, soft and fair; I have eggs on the spit; I cannot go yet,
sir. Now am I, for some five and fifty reasons, hammering,
hammering revenge: oh for three or four gallons of vinegar, to
sharpen my wits! Revenge, vinegar revenge, vinegar and mustard
revenge! Nay, an he had not lien in my house, 'twould never have
grieved me; but being my guest, one that, I'll be sworn, my wife
has lent him her smock off her back, while his own shirt has been
at washing; pawned her neck-kerchers for clean bands for him; sold
almost all my platters, to buy him tobacco; and he to turn monster
of ingratitude, and strike his lawful host! Well, I hope to raise
up an host of fury for't: here comes justice Clement.

Enter Justice CLEMENT, KNOWELL, and FORMAL.

CLEM
What's master Kitely gone, Roger?

FORM
Ay, sir.

CLEM
'Heart O' me! what made him leave us so abruptly?—How now,
sirrah! what make you here? what would you have, ha?

CLEM
An't please your worship, I am a poor neighbour of your
worship's—

CLEM
A poor neighbour of mine! Why, speak, poor neighbour.

COB
I dwell, sir, at the sign of the Water-tankard, hard by the
Green Lattice: I have paid scot and lot there any time this
eighteen years.

CLEM
To the Green Lattice?

COB
No, sir, to the parish: Marry, I have seldom scaped scot-free
at the Lattice.

CLEM
O, well; what business has my poor neighbour with me?

COB
An't like your worship, I am come to crave the peace of your
worship.

CLEM
Of me, knave! Peace of me, knave! Did I ever hurt thee, or
threaten thee, or wrong thee, ha?

COB
No, sir; but your worship's warrant for one that has wrong'd
me, sir: his arms are at too much liberty, I would fain have them
bound to a treaty of peace, an my credit could compass it with your
worship.

CLEM
Thou goest far enough about for't, I am sure.

KNO
Why, dost thou go in danger of thy life for him, friend?

COB
No, sir; but I go in danger of my death every hour, by his
means; an I die within a twelve-month and a day, I may swear by the
law of the land that he killed me.

CLOB
How, how, knave, swear he killed thee, and by the law? What
pretence, what colour hast thou for that?

COB
Marry, an't please your worship, both black and blue; colour
enough, I warrant you. I have it here to shew your worship.

CLEM
What is he that gave you this, sirrah?

COB
A gentleman and a soldier, he says, he is, of the city here.

CLEM
A soldier of the city! What call you him?

COB
Captain Bobadill.

COB
Bobadill! and why did he bob and beat you, sirrah? How began
the quarrel betwixt you, ha? speak truly, knave, I advise you.

COB
Marry, indeed, an't please your worship, only because I spake
against their vagrant tobacco, as I came by them when they were
taking on't; for nothing else.

FORM
Ha! you speak against tobacco? Formal, his name.

FORM
What's your name, sirrah?

COB
Oliver, sir, Oliver Cob, sir.

CLEM
Tell Oliver Cob he shall go to the jail, Formal.

FORM
Oliver Cob, my master, justice Clement, says you shall go to
the jail.

COB
O, I beseech your worship, for God's sake, dear master
justice!

CLEM
'Sprecious! an such drunkards and tankards as you are, come
to dispute of tobacco once, I have done: away with him!

COB
O, good master justice! Sweet old gentleman!

[To Knowell.]

KNOW
""Sweet Oliver,"" would I could do thee any good!—justice
Clement, let me intreat you, sir.

CLEM
What! a thread-bare rascal, a beggar, a slave that never
drunk out of better than piss-pot metal in his life! and he to
deprave and abuse the virtue of an herb so generally received in
the courts of princes, the chambers of nobles, the bowers of sweet
ladies, the cabins of soldiers!—Roger, away with him! 'Od's
precious—I say, go to.

COB
Dear master justice, let me be beaten again, I have deserved
it: but not the prison, I beseech you.

KNOW
Alas, poor Oliver!

CLEM
Roger, make him a warrant:—he shall not go, but I fear the
knave.

KNOW
Do not stink, sweet Oliver, you shall not go; my master will
give you a warrant.

COB
O, the Lord maintain his worship, his worthy worship!

CLEM
Away, dispatch him.
[Exeunt Formal and Cob;]
How now, master

KNOW
in dumps, in dumps! Come, this becomes not.

KNOW
Sir, would I could not feel my cares.

CLEM
Your cares are nothing: they are like my cap, soon put on,
and as soon put off. What! your son is old enough to govern
himself: let him run his course, it's the only way to make him a
staid man. If he were an unthrift, a ruffian, a drunkard, or a
licentious liver, then you had reason; you had reason to take care:
but, being none of these, mirth's my witness, an I had twice so
many cares as you have, I'd drown them all in a cup of sack. Come,
come, let's try it: I muse your parcel of a soldier returns not all
this while.",Ben Jonson,1975,"[79, 44, 33, 15, 15, 19, 22, 26, 34, 42, 52, 63, 74, 87]",14

Sneaky snake goes dancin', a-gigglin' and a-kissin'
I don't like old sneaky snake, he laughs too much you see
When he goes wigglin' through the grass, it tickles his underneath

Well, sneaky snake drinks root beer and he just makes me sick

481,Love Finds It's Own Way,"We've come a long way from nowhere
The road was often paved with tears and pain
Whenever I got lost you were always there
Through it all you never once complained

There were times I know you thought
The sun would never find us
Sometimes I felt that same way too
Now it looks as if all the hard times are behind us
One by one our dreams are coming true
(One by one, one by one)

Love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love finds its own way
It needs no guiding light

Whoa, oh, it only needs two people
With a dream and endless faith
And given time and a little patience
Love finds its own way

I know you must have pushed aside your feelings
When down inside you thought you'd fall apart
And if it hadn't been for your believin'
We might still be stumblin' in the dark

Now we're standing on the threshold of a new beginning
The doors of life are opened wide
For once in our lives we're finally winnin'
All because love is on our side

Love finds its own way
Through the darkest night
Love finds its own way
It needs no guiding light

Because love, love finds its own way
Through the darkest night

482,Wolf Creek Pass,"[Verse 1]
Me and Earl was haulin' chickens
On the flatbed out of Wiggins
And we'd spent all night on the uphill side
Of 37 miles of hell called Wolf Creek Pass
Which is up on the Great Divide

[Verse 2]
We was sittin' there suckin' toothpicks
Drinkin' Nehis and onion soup mix
And I says, ""Earl, let's mail a card to mother
And then send them chickens on down the other side
Yeah, let's give 'em a ride""

[Chorus]
Wolf Creek Pass
Way up on the Great Divide
Truckin' on down the other side

[Verse 3]
Well, Earl put down his bottle
Mashed his foot down on the throttle
And then a couple of boobs with a thousand cubes
In a 1948 Peterbilt screamed to life
We woke up the chickens

[Verse 4]
We roared up off of that shoulder
Spraying pine cones, rocks, and boulders
And put four hundred head of them Rhode Island Reds
And a couple of burnt-out roosters on the line
Look out below 'cause here we go

[Chorus]
Wolf Creek Pass
Way up on the Great Divide
Truckin' on down the other side

[Verse 5]
Well, we commenced to truckin'
And them hens commenced to cluckin'
And Earl took out a match and scratched his pants
And lit up the unused half of a dollar cigar and took a puff
Says, ""My, ain't this pretty up here""

[Verse 6]
I says, ""Earl, this hill can spill us
You better slow down, you gon' kill us
Just make one mistake and it's the pearly gates
For them 85 crates of USDA-approved cluckers
You wanna hit second?""

[Chorus]
Wolf Creek Pass
Way up on the Great Divide
Truckin' on down the other side

[Verse 7]
Well, Earl grabbed on the shifter
And he stabbed 'er into fifth gear
And then the chromium-plated
Fully-illuminated genuine accessory shift knob
Come right off in his hand
I says, ""You wanna screw that thing back on, Earl?""

[Verse 8]
He was tryin' to thread it on there
When the fire fell off of his cigar
And dropped on down, sorta rolled around
And then lit the cuff of Earl's pants
And burned a hole in his sock
Yeah, sorta set him right on fire

[Verse 9]
I looked on out of the window
And I started countin' phone poles
Going by at the rate of four to the seventh power
Well, I put two and two together
And added twelve and carried five
Come up with twenty two thousand telephone poles an hour

[Verse 10]
I looked at Earl and his eyes was wide
His lip was curled and his leg was fried
And his hand was froze to the wheel
Like a tongue to a sled in the middle of a blizzard

[Verse 11]
I says, ""Earl, I'm not the type to complain
But the time has come for me to explain
That if you don't apply some brake real soon
They're going to have to pick us up with a stick and a spoon""

[Verse 12]
Well, Earl rared back, cocked his leg, stepped down as hard as he could on the brake
And the pedal went clear to the floor and stayed right there on the floor
He says it's sorta like steppin' on a plum

[Verse 13]
Well, from there on down it just wasn't real pretty
It was hairpin county and switchback city
One of 'em looked like a can full of worms
Another one looked like malaria germs

[Verse 14]
Right in the middle of the whole damn show
Was a real nice tunnel, now wouldn't you know
Sign says clearance to the twelve foot line
But the chickens was stacked to thirteen nine

[Verse 15]
Well, we shot that tunnel at a hundred and ten
Like gas through a funnel and eggs through a hen
We took that top row of chickens off slicker than the scum off a Louisiana swamp

[Verse 16]
Went down and around, around and down
And we run out of ground at the edge of town
Bashed into the side of the feed store
Downtown Pagosa Springs

You was in the washing room with a boner, I'm pissed all over
I fucking hate you
These dudes saved you
I should've caved you
Left his body in the old shed like a snake do
Call me an Aryan, it's only right you'll get straight boots
And that's just a metaphor for how long I lace you
I hate you
Drag you from here to Scarborough and scrape you
Isn't it crazy how far this rap shit can take you?
I hate you
Be thankful, we don't gank you, shank you
Erase you, cremate you, send you up to Cadalack Ron to freebase you
You see PH he'll say, ""Damn, P ate you!""
Yeah, cause that's how Scotia do
Every time I'm close to you
I start getting this serious/Serius jonesing to start Dose-ing you
All them stupid faces you making in people's verses you spoken through
I just picture him going ""WOOOO!"" then BOOM!, he folds in two!
When Math hit you I was like, ""Homie's wild!""
Saw you sleeping standing up and was like, ""Holy cow!""
It was a camera phone so it was hard to catch it
He's still swinging, they aren't connecting

Why cause a scene? I thought it was a stand up thing to do

Should've smacked him upside his head, made it tilt like he's getting an ear drop

Turn they backs then come running back cause they're broke and their career's flop
Fuck that!

I lost my voice last time but now I'm clearing my throat
And I'm 'bout to make an example out you
I really take this shit serious/Serius Jones

Rob everything from his cell to his TV like he screen mirrored his phone

But tonight is a necklace I'm wearing his bones like the hunters of Sierra Leone
Listen to me
I'm out for blood and you shark food, dart you
With every needle in the pit from Saw 2 and draw through them all too
Talk through my shit and after when I spot you
Both hands up and it's not noon
Get your clock tuned

And you got the nerve to talk like you a live wire?
Fuck a mic, I should unplug your vocal cords
See, it's something about when you a champion, even when you hurt you still have to play
My man said, ""Put blood hands on the bald (ball) face""
I said, ""I will son (Wilson). And if the niggas you fed ex (FedEx) try to rescue you
From what I land (island) to the Tom blow his Cast Away
It's nasty! It's nasty!
Like Cortez ""nasty!""
I said it's nasty when I give it to him through the bars
Like jail food in a box
And you can feel your shit running after I eat half the tray
I said I don't care if your bars is packed with punches, cause this ain't Patrick's day
I mean, you see how I cleaned Jimz up, but now I'ma do him dirty
It's like shop lifting bars
Cause you can come to get everything in store but one thing don't register right you gon' wind up losing 30
Remember, ""10 bands, 15 bands, 20 bands fuck it man
I just lost 30 to the government
Never mind, never on my mind is another man""
And Patty's cake so hands down I got the upper hand
I mean, I give my man a G, you in the ER
See that's a manager
I mean, I didn't want to have to spell it out but my lawyer damn near had to can a DA for me to get to Canada
I said yo, you like the modern day Snow
Remember, ""Informer {speaks gibberish presumably just like Snow did at this same part}""
I said, but when I draw on a snitch, I give a rat a tat
See you think this is just battle rap but it ain't congrats when
You see a pound and then a Pat on his back
I said, what you think? I'm supposed to kneel/Neil cause your arm strong/Armstrong?
Well don't be the first to go outer space cause we not in the states
Cause you get the point
And we seen how you back down with a Calicoe in your face
I said uh, off principle, I'm busting (bussing) kids in the field if you trip
If I bomb your mouth it will tap your lip
Why you be rapping and doing this?
{mockingly licks his lips}
Well, that's ironic because I feel Pat's a lick
I mean, how you gon' lose the chain, I mean for real Pat you slip
But don't worry because when this sick pimp come to the Darkside and hit you with an ill mac' you lit (Illmaculate)
Hello?
One zip, let's go

[Round 2: Pat Stay]
Alright you got me
My voice was fine I really just didn't want to battle you
Personally, I think you suck and eh, I did what I had to do
I'm not proud of it, but hey, I'm working on my attitude
But one word that describes why I'm here tonight: ""contractual""
Dawg you fucking suck...crap...yuck
You're so behind on that word association shit it's fucked
This is his most stand out line from his second most recent battle
He ran this back twice too
And try not to laugh
If we- {Pat starts laughing to himself}
""If we beef over cheese you'll spill the beans to get me wrapped up
You trying to case a dilla (quesadilla)?""
Crap!
What I didn't understand is, how you didn't puke in your mouth when you said it
Then he has the fucking nerve to go like this {point to his head} like we don't get it
""Beef"", ""cheese"", ""beans"", ""wrapped up"", yeah we get it pal
""Eh, I'll drink it whether I have a jug or not (juggernaut)""
Shut your fucking mouth
Dip shit
Yo that style's way gone dude
You said a hair/here line this year, shame on you!
I really hate this dude
More than a cord you gotta manipulate a hundred different ways and position straight just so it'll charge your phone
I can't stand this dude
And all your self proclaimed titles got me madder than ever
You're not a legend just cause you're old and you've been rapping forever
""The King Of Battle Rap?"" You can have it, whatever
You and the queen Rone can live happily ever after together
(But yo...yo that's my dawg I'd actually be jealous)
But yo, the Bar Lord?
What a dick cheese name
Bar Lord? Pretty gay
How 'bout something different similar like, let's see...fag
Pip squeak legs, 6'3"" string bean, stupid little chick pea face, something you, ya know?
Or how about ""old washed up bum"" who just a few years back
Said, ""Smack needs 15 racks to bring me back.""
Now he's battling no names, once a month for crumbs
That speaks volumes my dude
You don't gotta lie and say you're doing it for the culture, it's cool
It's okay to be vulnerable sometimes, let him be honest with you
His pockets are tight and for a rapper his age this is the only thing profitable
There! It's out! It's cool dawg my pockets are too
Think about it, why the fuck would I go from Hollow to you?
I needed money right then and my only option was you
But like you had a miscarriage I'm still bodying you
Your punch will ""give me chapped lips""? You serious?
Serius is useless as Future using Siri is
I couldn't be more at ease if I heard I had beef with Serius
Be like, if you fight with your girl and she goes out for the night
But then remember she's on her period
But he thinks he's tough right now cause he got some boys around him
Til I scalp him and rip Layers off like I copied Royce's album
Don't wanna see me wilding, I'm a fucking animal like GG Allen
I'll pick this bitch up like cheerlead practice and Chuck Jones like the artist for the Loony Tunes series classics
But I'll keep it rap cause you ain't built for that
Little brittle ass ain't even been in a scrap
Every time you give him dap his fingers crack
And if he has, he lost every single match like he deleted his Tinder app
Jesus riding to Bethlehem in a hurry, psst, I'll whip his ass
Give him the next round I feel bad for his bitch ass

[Round 2: Serius Jones]
I said um, if Pat Stay is a Sucka Free Boss then who the fuck's the crew?
I mean what's up with dude? Because it's true that you do the most non free shit that you literally have to suck to do
I mean for instance, if you smoke meth
You crush it then, you plug it in, you light it then what?
Suck the stem
If you smoke grams out of Coke cans then you poke a hole in the side, put something on top, light it then what?
Suck the tin
I mean when you bit the Hollohan that fed you, that was some sucka shit
But for views you said fuck your friend
What did y'all do together? When you juice up, tie a vein and go ""oooh"" and suck it in
I mean, sucka shit
I mean, and what do you mean when you like, ""Sucka"" and ""brotha""
I mean tell the truth, where you got your swag? From watching Shaft?
I mean, this ain't a full roast, but let's let some truth sear him/serum
Because I don't know what kind of heads you been hanging next to, but you out the loop wearing hoop earrings
But speaking of hooping, if I say I'm D. Rose-ing that's no bullshit, that means I'm popping joints
AKA, even though we in Toronto, there can still be a shooting guard (god) but that's not the point
I said I just left New York court
But you never even balled or had nicks/Knicks
You was on a spree, well (Spreewell) the center of some big shit is what you in (Ewing) cause I know all Pat tricks (Patrick)
First he hit you with some, sarcasm
A couple jokes then y'all gas him
And then he goes into what shall now be known as ""a bar-spasm""
That's when you're like, ""I'm the god blasting
The force, I've been forged in my moms back in that lodge cabin
When my pops orgasm all happened I'm so hard rapping
I can open palm slap him
Quiet as Charles Chaplin"" and that's when
Y'all start clapping
To me, that multi shit is kid shit
But this big bitch, 6'6"" and diss kids that's autistic?
Fuck this lame doing? Face shoot him until you in space, drooling
And your brain moving a little different, now you can relate to him
See, just cause you bought coke from Scotians don't mean you from the streets Patty
They said, ""P...fassi. When we see him we feast 'pon him
But just cause they split your cocoa bread don't mean they gon' cover your beef, Patty
See, everybody know Jones got hustle in him
Hoes love his [?] we gotta duck the system
But y'all ain't got no struggle in you
You just sound like a fucking victim
Pat be like, ""What you know about migraines?
Where your mind strains to the point you wanna tie a vein
And feed your cock to a pit like you fly planes.""
This guy's strange
Fuck my old classics
It's not debatable that all I do is homi
Yeah I've been at the docs/docks, transferring weight, but I want a new body
That paper turn a nigga to monster, ori-goon-gami
Yeah I was too nice with I.C.E., well today I brought Horroh and Suge; that's two Shotty's
You ain't the type of white boy to grab a Tommy and ghost 50 for The Power
But you do take videos of yourself shitting while your girl's in the shower
So, it's weird when you mean cause where is the steam for your career though?
Cause you look scary on screen but your daily routine says ""Weirdo""
That's 2-0 let's go

[Round 3: Pat Stay]
I'm from the pimp capitol of Canada so I'd never disrespect the game
We all know you're a pimp, cause you brag about it everyday
I used to think that shit was cool cause shit, them dudes be getting paid
But since I fell in love with my girl's daughter, my perception changed
Now that's where me and you got a problem dude
Fuck this battle, as a man I need to talk to you
You need to watch your mouth cause now you got a daughter too
And glorifying it is all you do
Every blog, every post, every song you do
Bunch of pimp shit and dawg it's cool
But just remember she'll be watching you
I'm not hating on pimping I'm just saying it isn't honorable to
Put it out there when you got a daughter, you say
""Never love these bitches cause feelings will get you killed
Put them bitches to work, bring daddy his bills""
I felt that
Until, I looked this child in the face
A smile that could make a grown man cry in a powerful way
Like how could you take this from her, her values and strength
Just a low life piece of shit, a coward a snake
A fucking a [?] me, in a passionate way
Cause where I'm from...man none of them got daddies these days
This girl works at a hotel, it was salary based
Now she works out of the hotel at an hourly rate
Cause her daddy didn't take the time to clean the path that he paves
Now she's going through more men then a Latter Day Saint
Bro do me a favor
When you go home look in your baby's eyes
And picture another man...calling her ""bitch"" and make her cry
Manipulate and lie, infiltrate her mind
While he sits and waits outside
Some cheap motel for his money, while she's getting raped inside!
And she don't get a fucking dime
I've seen this shit a hundred times
""Shut up bitch. Here, sniff another line
Now you owe me."" It's how it works
Make her a stripper than strip her of her pride
Now I'm not saying that's what YOU DO
But that line is pretty fucking fine
Oh but you ain't hearing that
Bro, aren't you scared of that?
The day you see your daughter out and she's wearing ""that""
People staring at her like, ""Where the parents at?""
But a pimp knows her money, that's where it's at
He got her dipped, fake nails and the hair to match
And a cheap boob job, that's a clearance rack
Yo, he wants to box 'em, but when he looks at him and stares back he sees himself
They're both cons, it's a mirror match
But you know the worst part about it? You're a broke ass pimp
A fucking low class, no cash, slouch ass pimp
Got arrest two years ago at the mall for shoplifting
Should've ran faster at that parking lot, pimping
Aye! Fuck bars that shit is real
Now everyone heard your story
And you doing this stupid shit only confirms it for me
Fucking loser, still pimping little girls and turning 40
What a role model, probably have his own daughter working for him
Piece of shit
I feel bad for you, honestly dude
Pimping little girls
Honestly man, pimping little girls, all your small little scams
You need to grow some motherfucking balls and stop being scared
Haul up your pants and get a real fucking job like a man
I'm from the pimp capitol of Canada, remember that
So this shit I just said, might get me beef when I'm heading back
But I knew that'd be a risk and I accepted that
So I don't give a fuck about bars you should give me respect for that
Time

[Round 3: Serius Jones]
Ayo, this nigga made a whole round about me having bitches
Well you know what?
I done sold drugs, I got companies and you know I've been doing this for a while all over the board, that's greatness
But when they write me in the history books, I'ma be upfront
Funny that you gon' be on the back pages
I said, you know I do got a new daughter, that's actual
But it's funny because that must mean I'm pimping you because right now
I'm 'bout to be your daddy too
I said you know what? But in your rounds, it's good what you've done
Cause this is baring not boxing but this whole round
I'ma use boxing to put you in one
See, in my corner, we'll do you greasy on your face when you cut
Yeah I been official in that Mills lane, but if I'm in this ring
That mean I'm breaking you up
See I can't knock your crown off so I'ma knock your crown out
And y'all see, I ain't coming with no straight angles, that's a round house
See it ain't how many times you get hit, it's how many times you drop
But we don't even count the number of punches in your rounds cause look at the comp' you box (Compubox)
I smoldered this culture like Clay, but I started where the cash is (Cassius)
And if you tried to rope my dope then I'll leave four men (Ali/Foreman) on the canvas
""Ali"", ""Foreman"", ""canvas""
I said, see this is the black Rocky vers' Drago
I'm fighting Irish and I box Italiano
No I'm not Jay-Z but I will jig a nigga and there's a few selling rock in Marcy I know
Rocky Marciano
That mic tie son (Mike Tyson) when they jack dem, see (Jack Dempsey)
You know, cough a lung
And when the price of that sugar raise (Sugar Ray) we robbing son (Robinson)
See we do you doing all this moonwalking and dancing in the ring, I guess it's okay to be funny gay
And I seen you get fucked over by the Don King
We not saying that makes you a Pretty Boy but I'm not sure whether (weather) the Money May
Aww man
Y'all with me? Boxing!
I said no jab, but that bitch you in love with look like a Bob
And her weave's bad
You battled to knock of steam but you Paco Jeans, you just seem/seam bad
I said if it wasn't for drugs you'd prolly really be trash
How ironic he only gets into his rhythms with his punches off a speed bag
Aww man, I said fuck my record deal
All I need is these bars to go pop on you
You wanna check my record, deal
It's heavy metal on it so it's only right I go rock on you
See, you Cold playing
And I got Bare Naked Ladies that serve corners but
My Queen a nina and that drum will get under your skin she got some nerve on her (Nirvana)
I hop out the Van, hailing (Halen) leave 5 Maroon when I shoot through
Duok duok duok, and if you don't tell
These (D's) MC's to run you Walk This Way I might air a Smith (Aerosmith) at you too (U2)
Close your doors
Give you that Megadeath when I cold bang your head
You be happy I did it when I send a shot through your skull
Now you Grateful Dead
He said, ""I'll slit your throat with tears rolling down my cheek""
And y'all said, ""Whoo!""
I said, ""Look at you emotional.""
When we kill we don't feel none boy
But if I was crying while I was cutting your cords
Baby it would be tears of joy
But, enough of the metaphorical violent descriptions
Let's get into some rhetorical obvious scriptures
Like, who am I?
The first nigga that brought jokes and conversation to battle
The first street nigga to have a classic played on a channel
Went from DVD's to MTV to BET
Now you 'bout worth as much as in the Six as Meek CD's
But who you though?
A former hemi fiend that juices and squeezes in tees
Rock Kangols and creasey jeans
And usually battles geeky dweebs
I mean, I'm not saying that you a girl
I'm just [?] in this shit
Not only did you get washed but on camera
You gon' be under the suds buried and you just got your whole World Dominated in the Six

486,Linda On My Mind,"[Chorus]
Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind

[Verse 1]
Yes I know that I once loved her
And I placed no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plans
The way that Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close
As she danced with me

[Verse  2]
She said, ""I've loved you for a long time
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I've tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger
I can't hide it any longer""
And so I thought I'd better let you know

[Chorus]
Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind",Conway Twitty,1975,"[93, 61, 62, 62, 65, 71, 83, 96]",8
487,My First Day Without Her,"[Verse1: Khujo]
You 'bout to make me slam yo' back clean out
But I luv her till death do us part
Though she divorced my pop the hard way
Back in nineteen ""yassey"" for the past sixteen years
I took on the responsibility of daddy...
Ma ol' burd... puttin a real buzz in my ear, makin sho' it marinate
And not go out the other ear
Guess who? stood beside me when y'all wouldn't force fed when I
Couldn't lift a spoon to my skull
God is good, God is kind mimmicin' her taught me how to say mine ...
Grace improvised wit bakin' soda when it wasn't no toothpaste
Now what that went with?? my ol' burd cried tears of joy
When she heard I wasn't gon' serve time for possession
Of the ""sawed off"" runnin' out of spurs
When I came home blowed and couldn't find the key hole, guess who
Unlocked the doors, my Ol' burd puttin' my hairs out
I better eat before you bug me to death
Shut-up you old ungrateful ass nigga, she trying to help yo' ass...
I wasn't ready to eat yet but I enjoyed the dinner she said, ""I'm glad""
Slid down my esophagus wit ease, even though she have this skin disease
That won't allow me to gain weight do my own eyes deceive me
Guess who tuck me in before I started drivin this Benz
Again & again, told me not to and when I did...
Guess who beat the dog shit outta me kid
My Moma didn't play, shiiit, I had to pick the switches...
You guess who!!!

[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]
My Moma, destination unknown, went out on her own
She was barely even grown and became my Moma
I never knew my dad, so even when the times got bad
I was glad cause I had my Moma
For so long she had to be strong
I know at certain times she was wrong
But she still my Moma, it still amazes me
The Lord had to help her raise me judging from the way I used to be
My Moma, the biggest player that I know I love her so
Hell everything I got I owe to my Moma
Thank you for caring, thank you for sharing yo' luv
I guess that was yo' way of preparing
Yo' son to be the one and not the two
To make you and my daddy's dream come true
But what a surprise a car wreck left you paralyzed
The sheet was pulled over yo' eyes when the doctor advised
The family that you might not ever talk again
But you talkin' so I know that you gon' walk again
But take yo time, guess who's the inspiration for the rhyme... My Moma

Who was tha first to hold you in some arms
Tha first to change your diaper when your stomach wasn't calm
Your Moma, wit that drama brought you into this world
From a world of down under
I wonder now she know when I was lying, when I was telling the truth
With the proof she would explain how I've been skipping school
With that boys putting wholes on my back with the same belt
Around my waist that held my panst up
Takin' back only got you closer to Southern Bell
Got your forehead swell
I swear she knew when it was real or when it was fake like Clampetts
With dreads and if I couldn't handle a situation then I fled
Behind closed doors I froze, in Garnett holes I rose
Who that hell got my bond
Standing in front of that two-inch glass
A woman ready to hand the cash over for her son...
My Mama!!

Sometimes we get it on, I know at times I'm wrong
Lookin' into my eyes just to let me know she tried is enough for me
I'm callin' a truce it seems we more like brother and sister
Even though she pay the bills wit the mister
Brought me home in '72 and gave me all she had
Cause I was left at birth she knew it could work
Since she gave me the first chance my song and dance
Pearl, my world, what would I do without her spark
Probably be on the street wit nothin' to eat but I got a happy home
Ever since my first day it's heaven sent now I know
What it's meant when I say
I appreciate what you've done and what you do your only son...
Guess who???

The only one that cares for real and really understands how I feel
Help me over come my fears and never left me through the years
So I dedicate this song for you, for all that you brought me through
I know there will never be another that will love me like my Mother",Goodie Mob,1975,"[94, 98]",2
488,I Wanna Learn A Love Song,"I come fresh from the street, fast on my feet
Kinda lean and lazy
Not much meat on my bones and a whole lot alone
And more than a little bit crazy

The old six string was all i had, to keep my belly still
And for each full hour lesson i gave
I got a crisp ten dollar bill

You see, she was married for seven years
To a concrete castle king
She said she wanted to learn to play the guitar
And to hear her children sing
So i'd show up about once a week in my faded tight legged jeans
With a back log full of hobo stories and delapadated dreams

So i tried to teach her a couple of chords And an easy melody
But it always turned out she'd rather listen to my guitar and me
I could hear her old man laughing in the den
Playing stud poker with the boys
While i sang so soft in the living room, too scared to make much noise

I came one week, the den was dark and she met me at the door
And we sat on the couch and we sang and talked till i could not sing no more
You know the silence kept in building
Her eyes grew much too wide
And i could hear both of our heart beats, but there was no place to hide

She said i wanna learn a love song
Full of happy things
She said i wanna learn a love song
Won't you let me hear you sing
She said i wanna learn a love song
I wanna hear you play
She said i wanna learn a love song
Before you go away

I guess you know what happened
God i, I never been so clean
I feel like i'm workin in a Hollywood movie
Or living out a good bad dream
And all them pin up girls in that tinsle world
Never touched me like she can
It took another mans wife in the real world life to make this boy a man

She said i wanna learn a love song
Full of happy things
She said i wanna learn a love song
Won't you let me hear you sing
She said i wanna learn a love song
I wanna hear you play
She said i wanna learn a love song
Before you go away

I guess you know i stayed",Harry Chapin,1975,"[95, 56, 44, 46, 56, 67, 77, 80, 87]",9

There's a buzzard of gulls

Only lovers alive
Running in the dark

Anna rolled away
Said we never wanted much
Just a rollercoast'
Our love was never number one
Sugar for the pill
You know it's just the way things are
Can't abide the sun
This jealousy will break the whole

Cut across the sky
And move a little closer now
Lying in a bed of greed
You know I had the strangest dream

Anna rolled away
Said we never wanted much
Just a rollercoast'
Our love was never number one
Sugar for the pill
You know it's just the way things are
Can't abide the sun

I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ahhhhhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

492,I'm Her Fool,"She tells me all the time that she loves me
She even poured the wine at the same
She taught me like my first great teacher
To love and I love the same

And I love to go to school, I like to shoot pool
I can't be a fool
'Cause I'm her fool

I've run like a dog when she calls me
'Cause she pets me when I bury my bone
I stay overnight with her sometimes
But I don't stay over long

'Cause I gotta go to school, I like to shoot pool
I can't be a fool
'Cause I'm her fool

I'm her fool in the evening
And I'm her fool when it's dawn
I guess I'd be on her side
Even if her side were wrong

You're really right, you're right
You're really wrong, you're wrong
You're really right, you're right
You're really wrong, you're wrong

You're really right, you're right
You're really wrong, you're wrong
You're really right, you're right
You're really wrong, you're wrong

My papa said: ""You made a mistake, son""
But my mama said: ""That girl, she's alright""
Well, I come to my own decision
That I'm goin' to be with her tonight

'Cause I love to go to school, I like to shoot pool
I can't be a fool
'Cause I'm her fool

I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool
I'm her, I'm her, I'm her fool

Midnight on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave chicane
Staring as she called my name

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Breakdown on the shoreline
Can't move, it's an ebb tide
Morning don't get here till night
Searching for her silver light

Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no no

494,Best Of My Love,"[Verse 1]
Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams

[Break]
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

[Refrain]
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

[Verse 2]
Beautiful faces and loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

[Break]
That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above

[Refrain]
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus]
Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love, oh
Sweet darling, you get the best of my love

[Bridge]
I'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night and I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

[Verse 3]
But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slipping away

[Bridge]
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough

[Refrain]
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love, oh
Sweet darling, you get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling you get the best of my love, oh

Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss

496,To The Door Of The Sun (Alle Porte Del Sole),"I look in the mirror, but I look at a stranger
Can this be the sensible me who said he wouldn't fall in love
I suddenly saw you, and I knew there was danger
Why run away when I love you and want you forever
I know I'm a dreamer, but I don't want to wake up
Whenever you touch me ....I can fly to the sky

Alle porte del sole
Ai confini del mare
Quante volte col pensiero
Ti ho portato insieme a me
E nel buio sognavo
La tua mano leggera
Ogni porta che si apriva
Mi sembrava primavera

Alle porte del sole
Ai confini del mare
Quante volte col pensiero
Ti ho portato insieme a me
Ti ho portato insieme a me
Ti ho portato insieme a me......

I look in the future, the golden tomorrows
As long as you're walking beside me, I'll always be a dreamer
As long as we're sharing, the smiles and the sorrows
Will make everyday we're together, a day to remember
I have no illusions, just a heart full of lovin'
It's a wonderful world I know, whenever you're near

To the door of the sun, to the ends of the sea
I will travel anywhere as long as you are there with me
On the wings of the wind, in the arms of a storm
It is always summer weather, with your love to keep me warm

Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited

500,Where Is The Love,"[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring a trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake (and Fergie)]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us

Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: Apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

[Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love?

She this envy if I wanna get grimey wit' it at Bungalow Eight
Opium down in Miami
But when I walk in, I look around and I think

[Continuation of Hook]
I look at all the lonely people (x4)

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Yo, I'm headin' out, 'bout to do some fleshin' out
I know my flesh endowed
With somethin' to prove, I'm settin' out
On a trip to Heaven's mouth, yeah
I'm steppin' out in the name of love
Who knew the Devil could slow dance?
We have pathological romances with technological advance
Infatuated with infatuation and
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
Make a baby mama's all bastardization and
Lonely people all through the city
They club hoppin' and they love shoppin' and they thug posturin'
Thugs be lockin' horns with Crips on them drug blocks
And them dollars flow right out of the 'hood
When you tryin' to make paper out of the wood
You know that money don't grow on trees
For paper people change colors like leaves
And they fall off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin' you and your dogs who store all call off
That much deserved ass whippin'
He snitchin', he twitchin', he bitchin', he all soft
Never work with his hands
Little kid on the block who always ran
At all costs, gotta be in the club
Lookin' for happiness or the meaning of love
Then it hit him, out the blue like a vision
All of a sudden he don't like the way he been livin'
And wanna be forgiven
How I know? Cuz I'm right there wit' him
Yo, yo

Tattoos tell 'em who you are
Plastic Surgery coup d'etat the God
Uh, lasers to remove the scar
And then you are, you a supastar, supastar
It's your birthday and you in the club
Talkin' ""Holla back"" and ""Nigga what""
So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet on the Nasdaq
Blank stares like nobody care
In a room so exclusive nobody there
But really, truth is that nobody there
Cuz it's feelings inside that nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see, fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities decorated like Christmas trees
God complex like they born on Christmas Eve
Sing a song to yourself and you stand alone
Get nominated for a gold gramophone
Walk the red carpet, left your man at home
Security snatchin' people camera phones
You got rose gold yellow bottles, pink Cashmere
So ahead of the trend, that's so last year
Last month, last day, last hour, last minute
Your pursuit of cool is so passionate
Doin for the cash in it, laugh in his face
If it's def or anybody who don't stay in his place
So popular can't go nowhere, folks stoppin' ya
Might want to check a thermometer
When you go to a movie heat rises
Surrounded by people still lonely, that's why you need disguises

503,Up In A Puff Of Smoke,"In the laid back California town of sunny San Raphael
Lived a girl named Pearly Sweetcake you probably knew her well
She'd been stoned fifteen of her eighteen years and the story was widely told
That she could smoke 'em faster than anyone could roll
Her legend finally reached New York that Grove Street walk-up flat
Where dwelt The Calistoga Kid a beatnik from the past
With long browned lightnin' fingers he takes a cultured toke
And says ""Hell I can roll 'em faster, Jim, than any chick can smoke""
So a note gets sent to San Raphael for the Championship of the World
The Kid demands a smoke off ""Well bring him on! Says Pearl
""I'll grind his fingers off his hands he'll roll until he drops""
Says Calistog ""I'll smoke that chick till she blows up and pops""
So they rent out Yankee Stadium and the word is quickly spread
Come one come all who walk or crawl price just two lids a head
And from every town and hamlet over land and sea they speed
The world's greatest dopers with the Worlds greatest weed
Hashishers from Morocco, hemp smokers from Peru
And the Shamnicks from Bagun who puff the deadly Pugaroo
And those who call it Light of Life and those that call it boo
See the dealers and their ladies wearing turquoise lace and leather
See the narcos and the closet smokers puffin all together
From the teenies who smoke legal to the ones who've done some time
To the old man who smoked reefer back before it was a crime
And the grand old house that Ruth built is filled with the smoke and cries
Of fifty thousand screaming heads all stoned out of their minds
And they play the national anthem and the crowd lets out a roar
As the spotlight hits The Kid and Pearl ready for their smokin' war
At a table piled up high with grass as high as a mountain peak
Just tops and buds of the rarest flowers not one stem branch or seed
Maui Wowie Panama Red and Acapulco Gold
Kif from East Afghanistan and rare Alaskan Cold
Sticks from Thailand Ganja from the Islands and Bangkok's Bloomin' Best
And some of that wet imported shit that capsized off Key West
Oaxacan tops and Kenya Bhang and Riviera Fleurs
And that rare Manhatten Silver that grows down in the New York sewers
And there's bubblin' ice cold lemonade and sweet grapes by the bunches
And there's Hersheys bars and Oreos incase anybody gets the munchies
And the Calistoga Kid he sneers and Pearley she just grins
And the drums roll low and the crowd yells go and the worlds first Smoke Off begins
Kid flicks his magic fingers once and zap that first joints rolled
Pearl takes one drag with her mighty lungs and woosh that roach is cold
Then The Kid he rolls his Super Bomb that'd paralyze a moose
And Pearly takes one super hit and slurp that bomb defused
Then he rolls three in just ten seconds and she smokes 'em up in nine
And everybody sits back and says ""this just might take some time""
See the blur of flyin fingers see the red coal burnin bright
As the night turns into mornin and the mornin fades to night
And the autumn turns to summer and a whole damn year is gone
But the two still sit on that roach-filled stage smokin' and rollin' on
With tremblin hands he rolls his jays with fingers blue and stiff
She coughs and stares with bloodshot gaze and puffs through blistered lips
And as she reaches out her hand for another stick of gold
The Kid he gasps ""Goddamn it, bitch! there's nothin' left to roll!""
""Nothin left to roll?!"" screams Pearl, ""Is this some twisted joke?
I didn't come here to fuck around man I come here to smoke""
And she reaches cross the table and grabs his bony sleeves
And she crumbles his body between her hands like dried and brittle leaves
Flickin' out his teeth and bones like useless stems and seeds
And then she rolls him in a Zig Zag and lights him like a roach
And the fastest man with the fastest hands goes up in a puff of smoke
In the laid-back California town of sunny San Raphael
Lives a girl named Pearly Sweetcake you probly know her well
She's been stoned twenty-one of her twenty-four years and the storys widely told
How she still can smoke 'em faster than anyone can roll
While off in New York City on a street that has no name
There's the hands of the Calistoga Kid in the Viper Hall of Fame
And underneath his fingers there's a little golden scroll
That says ""Beware of Bein' the Roller When There's Nothin' Left to Roll""",Shel Silverstein,1975,"[47, 25, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 38, 51, 62, 86, 97, 99]",13
504,I Have A Dream,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.

But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.

Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds."" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.

It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.

But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.

We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.

As we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied, as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""For Whites Only."" We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.

I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.

Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.

I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.""

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.

This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.

This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, ""My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.""

And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!

Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!

Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!

But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!

Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!

Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.

And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, ""Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!""",Martin Luther King Jr.,1975,"[50, 56, 59, 65, 75, 79, 89]",7

507,Roll On Down The Highway,"We rented a truck and a semi to go
Travel down the long and winding road
Look on the map I think we've been here before
Close the doors let's roll once more
Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write
I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see
Look in the mirror is he still followin' me?
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll

Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
Come on boys, let's get ready to race
454 coming over the hill
The man on patrol, is going to give us a bill
The time's real short, you know the distance is long
I'd rather have a jet but it's not in the song
Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck
We gotta keep movie' if we're going to make a buck
Let it roll down the highway",Bachman–Turner Overdrive,1975,"[67, 43, 26, 14, 14, 18, 22, 30, 37, 55, 67]",11

Ughh, Listen

[Verse 1: ELG]

The last time I spoke
With my grandmother/

She said the world's in
My hands and none others/

She said close your eyes
And open your heart/

Be a leader not a follower
That'll set you apart/

I put my hand on the Bible
And I spoke to GOD/

I told Him give me the
Strength to fuck all the odds/

On the edge of my state
Feeling like Cape Cod/

Pushed overboard like
I'm swimming with cephalopods/

I swear to GOD
The black shades/

Hide pain I held within
For damn near two decades/

Since the seventh grade
I've been a motherfucking renegade/

Younging's post up on corners but
They ain't selling no lemonade/

It's the environment they
Placed us in/

Neck barely above water
Yet no place to swim/

The faces dim when the
Truth gets exposed/

The reason radio ain't got no soul
Is cause they souls already sold/

Now let it knock nigga
Now let it knock nigga
Now let it knock nigga
Now let it knock

Uh huh Uh huh
Uh huh Uh huh

Ugh..

[Verse 2: ELG]

Denim jacket on
Starting the day fresh ho/

How you say fresh in spanish
Bitch, that's fresco/

We worry 'bout our freshest fits
While innocent men on death row/

And to shut us up they lock us
In jail or the ghettos/

I'm just keeping it real
Signed and sealed/

It's impossible for closed
Mouths to ever eat a meal/

Modesty or vanity
I'm tryna keep an even keel/

But the devil always leaves
The louder message in my ear/

We eager to hate and
Judge for what it seems/

But fuck them haters
And fuck their dreams/

Lost my trust cause
Of the lies behind the scenes/

And replaced the pain inside
With material things/

No sense of direction but
Can't admit that we lost/

And regardless in the end
Your fucking life is the cost/

Don't let them mold you/
Don't let them make you/

This world is a cold one
Don't let it break you/

Now let it knock nigga
Now let it knock nigga

I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be

[Verse 2]
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

[Verse 3]
So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand

[Bridge]
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

[Verse 4]
Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation

[Verse 5]
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

[Verse 6]
Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that lets me down

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'

Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me

I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both

Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg

Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot

Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

3
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:25,806
State your business, or
prepare to get winged!

4
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:30,605
Calm yourselves gentlemen,
I mean you no harm.

5
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:35,173
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.

6
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,327
Good cold evening gentlemen,

7
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,977
I'm looking for a
pair of slave traders

8
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:43,736
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

9
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,610
Might that be you?

10
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,166
Who wants to know?

11
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,716
Well, I do.

12
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,634
I'm Dr. King Schultz,
this is my horse, Fritz.

13
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,251
What kinda doctor?

14
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,698
Dentist.

15
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,487
Now are you the Speck Brothers,

16
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,299
and did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

17
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:02,233
So what?

18
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,325
So, I wish to parley with you.

19
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,426
Speak English.

20
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

21
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,031
Please forgive me, it
is a second language.

22
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:13,653
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

23
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,706
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

24
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,180
Hello you poor devils!

25
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:25,511
Is there one amongst you, who was formerly
a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?

26
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,815
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.

27
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:31,322
Who said that?

28
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,998
What's your name?

29
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,511
Django.

30
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:28,704
Then you're exactly
the one I'm looking for.

31
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,720
Do you know who the
Brittle Brothers are?

32
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,184
Who are they?

33
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,736
Big John...

34
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,025
Ellis...

35
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:48,630
and Raja... sometime
they call him Lit'le Raj.

36
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,269
They was overseers at
Carrucan plantation.

37
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,597
Not anymore.

38
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:57,977
Tell me...

39
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:02,392
If you were to see any of these three
gentlemen again, would you recognize them?

40
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,591
Hey!

41
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:05,590
Stop talk with 'em like that.

42
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:06,935
Like what?

43
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,169
Like that!

44
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:11,113
My good man, I'm simply
trying to ascertain-

45
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,777
Speak English, goddammit!

46
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,182
Everybody calm down,

47
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:19,204
I'm simply a customer trying
to conduct a transaction.

48
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,076
I don't care. No sale.

49
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,139
Now off wit' you!

50
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,561
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
o'course they're for sale.

51
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:27,294
Move it.

52
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:32,783
My good man, did you simply get
carried away with your dramatic gesture,

53
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:36,728
or are you pointing your weapon
at me with lethal intention?

54
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,930
Last chance, fancy pants.

55
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,825
Oh, very well...

56
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,514
I'm sorry to have put
a bullet in your beast,

57
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,655
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

58
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,229
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

59
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,319
Goddamn son of a bitch!

60
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,616
You shot Roscoe!

61
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,011
And you killed Ace!

62
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:30,274
Hey, I only shot your brother
once he threatened to shoot me.

63
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,336
And I do believe I have

64
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:36,610
one, two, three, four, five
witnesses who can attest to that fact.

65
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,462
Damn legs busted!

66
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,326
No doubt. Now, if you can keep
your caterwauling down to a minimum,

67
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:45,406
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

68
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,651
God fucking dammit!

69
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,260
As I was saying,

70
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:57,127
if you were to see the Brittle Brothers
again, you could recognize them?

71
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,925
Yeah.

72
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:01,940
Sold American! So Mr. Speck,

73
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,948
Mr. Speck, how much
for young Django here?

74
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,668
That iron is nasty business.

75
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,622
Could you hold this for a moment?

76
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,411
Thank you. Django,
get up on that horse.

77
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:32,251
Also if I were you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.

78
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:49,731
Nigger, don't you
touch my brother's coat!

79
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,366
Goddammit!

80
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:10,490
One hundred... ten...

81
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,835
twenty... and five...

82
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,085
for young Django here.

83
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:21,997
And since you won't be needing it anymore,
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

84
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:27,446
Also... Mr. Speck, I am afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

85
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:28,941
Do you have one?

86
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,792
You go to hell, dentist!

87
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,194
I thought not.

88
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,425
No worries!

89
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,074
I come prepared.

90
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,248
Thank you.

91
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,406
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

92
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,420
Now as to you poor devils...

93
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:14,184
So as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

94
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:17,329
you gentlemen have two choices.

95
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:22,629
One: once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

96
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,530
then carry him to the nearest town.

97
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:28,277
Which would be at least thirty-seven
miles back the way you came.

98
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,243
Or Two:

99
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,601
You could unshackle yourselves...

100
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:37,152
take that rifle, put a bullet in
his head, bury the two of them deep,

101
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,567
and then make your way to a more
enlightened area of this country.

102
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,825
The choice is yours.

103
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,679
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

104
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,366
the North Star is that one.

105
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,041
Tata.

106
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:13,811
Now wait a minute fellas,
let's talk about this.

107
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:20,997
You gotta be reasonable
on a situation like this.

108
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,774
I'm not a bad guy, look
I'm just doing my job!

109
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:29,231
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

110
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:34,654
Tell you what boys, take me to Lit'le
Duck in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.

111
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,621
No. No, please...

112
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,061
What's everybody staring at?

113
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,179
They never seen a
nigger on a horse before.

114
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,888
Good morning inn keeper!

115
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,700
Two beers for two weary travelers.

116
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,995
Ah, it's still a bit early.

117
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,229
We won't be open for another hour.

118
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,633
By then we'll be servin' breakfast.

119
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,407
Wow wow wow wow!

120
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,723
What the hell you
think you doin', boy?

121
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,081
Get that nigger outta here.

122
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,972
Help! Help!

123
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,241
Inn keeper!

124
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:58,853
Remember, get the
sheriff, not the marshall.

125
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,106
Alas...

126
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:06,397
Now we must act as our own bartender.

127
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,010
Sit down, my boy.

128
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,332
What kinda dentist are you?

129
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,126
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

130
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:35,747
These days I practice
a new profession.

131
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,441
Bounty Hunter.

132
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,418
D'you know what a Bounty Hunter is?

133
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,719
No.

134
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,930
Well...

135
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:56,675
The way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

136
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,038
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

137
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:06,788
Prost.

138
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,961
The state places a
bounty on a man's head,

139
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,302
I track that man, I find
that man, I kill that man,

140
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:25,642
after I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities,

141
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,860
and sometimes that's
easier said then done,

142
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,769
I show that corpse to the
authorities proving, yes indeed,

143
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:35,391
I truly have killed him, at which
point the authorities pay me the bounty.

144
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:39,695
So... like slavery, it's
a flesh-for-cash business.

145
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,482
What's a bounty?

146
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,538
It's like a reward.

147
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:50,828
You kill people and
they give you a reward?

148
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,919
Certain people, yeah.

149
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:54,019
Bad people?

150
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,272
Aah!

151
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,331
Badder they are, bigger the reward!

152
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,968
Which brings me to you.

153
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:04,030
And I must admit that I'm at a bit
of a quandary when it comes to you.

154
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:07,442
On one hand, I despise slavery.

155
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,520
On the other hand...

156
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,844
I need your help, if you're not in
a position to refuse, all the better.

157
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:19,607
So for the time being, I'm gonna make
this slave malarkey work to my benefit.

158
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,472
Still... having said that...

159
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,868
I feel guilty.

160
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,252
So...

161
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:32,393
I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

162
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,846
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

163
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:49,621
However I've had this endeavor, I'm
- I'm at a slight disadvantage,

164
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,049
in so far as, I don't
know what they look like.

165
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:56,232
But you do... don't you?

166
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,866
I know what they
look like, all right.

167
00:17:59,008 --> 00:17:59,693
Good.

168
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:01,905
So here's my agreement.

169
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,874
You travel with me
until we find them-

170
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:05,952
Where we goin'?

171
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:10,210
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.

172
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:15,921
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find them.

173
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,591
And when we find them...

174
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:20,833
you point them out, and I kill them!

175
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,713
You do that, I agree to
give you your freedom,

176
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:30,080
twenty-five dollars per Brittle
brother -that's seventy-five dollars,

177
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:34,281
and as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

178
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:44,819
Okay boys, fun's over.

179
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,699
Come on out.

180
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:54,258
All right folks, calm down.

181
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,883
You bout your business.

182
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:00,054
The jokers will be gone soon.

183
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,034
Now...

184
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:07,302
why y'all wanna come into
my town and start trouble,

185
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,724
and... scare all these nice people?

186
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,847
You ain't got nothin' better to do,

187
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:21,232
than to come into Bill
Sharp's town and show your ass?

188
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,297
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?

189
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,382
Now you can get the marshall.

190
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,265
Marshall, marshall!

191
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:51,740
Should we wait inside?

192
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,019
Can't we just leave?

193
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,449
After you.

194
00:19:56,426 --> 00:20:00,658
Move that buckboard long ways
'cross the street from the saloon!

195
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,006
I want six men, six
riffles behind it.

196
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,334
I want two men, two
rifles up on this roof,

197
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:07,994
two men two rifles on that roof.

198
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,055
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

199
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,998
Somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

200
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,452
You in the saloon!

201
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:21,351
We got a hundred riffles aimed
on every way outta that buildin'!

202
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,137
You got once chance
git outta this alive!

203
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,164
You and your nigger come out right
now with your hands over your head,

204
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,347
and I mean, right now!

205
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,734
Is this the marshall I have
the pleasure of addressing?

206
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,336
Yes it is.

207
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:39,856
This is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.

208
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,192
That wunderbar, marshall.

209
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:46,299
I have relieved
myself of all weapons,

210
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,448
and just as you have instructed,

211
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,399
I am ready to step outside,

212
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:56,407
with my hands raised above my head.

213
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:58,677
I trust,

214
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:03,818
as a representative of the criminal justice
system of The United States of America,

215
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:06,641
I shan't be shot down in the street,

216
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,833
by either you or your deputies,

217
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:12,474
before I've had my day in court.

218
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,776
You mean like you did our sheriff?

219
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,278
Shot 'em down like
a dog in the street!

220
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,675
Yes, that's exactly what I mean!

221
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,847
Do I have your word as a lawman,

222
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:25,058
not to shoot me down
like a dog in the street?

223
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,191
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy
seein' somethin' like that,

224
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:35,083
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

225
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,753
Fair enough marshall, here we come!

226
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,333
They're a little tense out there.

227
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:47,292
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

228
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:49,946
Come ahead.

229
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,218
You unarmed?

230
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,593
Yes indeed we are.

231
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:04,160
Marshall Tatum, may I
address you and your deputies,

232
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:06,618
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

233
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,142
as to the incident
that just occurred?

234
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:11,277
Go on.

235
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,167
My name is Dr. King Schultz,

236
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:18,274
and like yourself, marshall,
I am a servant of the court.

237
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,418
The man lying dead in the dirt,

238
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:24,225
who the good people of Daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,

239
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,341
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

240
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:30,831
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

241
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,588
with a price on his head
of two hundred dollars.

242
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:36,533
Now, that's two hundred
dollars, dead or alive.

243
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:38,553
The hell you say!

244
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:42,308
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

245
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,841
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

246
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:48,333
sometime in the last two years.

247
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,737
I know this because three years ago,

248
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:57,688
he was rustling cattle from the B. C.
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.

249
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,695
Now this is a warrant,

250
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:07,023
made out by circuit court Judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.

251
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,253
You're encouraged to wire him.

252
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:11,331
He'll back up who I am,

253
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,359
and who your dear
departed sheriff was.

254
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:24,175
In other words marshall,

255
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,245
you owe me two hundred dollars.

256
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,691
I'll be damned.

257
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,740
After this Brittle
business is behind us...

258
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:10,468
you'll be a free man.

259
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:14,858
With a horse, seventy five
dollars in your back pocket.

260
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,719
What's your plan after that?

261
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:22,148
Find my wife...

262
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,492
and buy her freedom.

263
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:27,928
Django...

264
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:31,245
I had no idea you were a married man.

265
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,353
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

266
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,313
Me and my wife do.

267
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,228
All men in Carrucan did,
and that's why we uh...

268
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,467
we run off.

269
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,170
Django...

270
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,065
Django, Django...

271
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,683
You got sand, Django.

272
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,609
Boy's got sand.

273
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:58,842
I got no use for niggers with sand.

274
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:03,605
I want you to burn the runaway
""r"" right here on his cheek.

275
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:06,494
And the girl too.

276
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:10,355
And I want you to take 'em
to the Greenville auction,

277
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,199
and sell 'em...

278
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:14,264
Both of 'em...

279
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,520
Separately.

280
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:21,227
And this one...

281
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,577
you will sell him cheap.

282
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,442
In Greenville?

283
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,927
There should be some
sort of a records office.

284
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,914
You know when she was sold...

285
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,830
you know where she came from...

286
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,855
and you know her name.

287
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:53,128
What is her name?

288
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:54,835
Broomhilda.

289
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,442
What?

290
00:25:57,784 --> 00:25:59,344
Broom-hilda.

291
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:01,633
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-hm.

292
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,576
Were her owners German?

293
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,186
Yeah, how you know?

294
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:11,165
She wan't born on The Carrucan Plantation,
she was raised by a German mistress.

295
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,360
Von Shafts.

296
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:13,807
She speak a little German too.

297
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,044
- Your wife?
- Hm-hm.

298
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:20,013
When she was little, her mistress taught
her so she has somebody speak German with.

299
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,516
Alright, let me get this straight.

300
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:28,964
Your slave wife speaks German, and
her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

301
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,906
Yep.

302
00:26:34,324 --> 00:26:36,019
They call me Hildi.

303
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,550
When we gain access
to these plantations,

304
00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:59,456
we'll be putting on an ""Act"".

305
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,307
You'll be playing a character.

306
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:11,522
Hm?

307
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,389
No?

308
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,544
But during the act, you
can never break character.

309
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:27,729
D'you understand?

310
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,837
Yeah. Don't break character.

311
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:36,895
And you character is
that of the ""Valet"".

312
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,194
What that is?

313
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:42,521
That's a fancy word for servant.

314
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,498
- ""Valet"".
- Hm-hm!

315
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:49,970
And now Django, you may chose
your character's costume.

316
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,297
You want that I pick
up my own clothes?

317
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:56,531
You
- but of course!

318
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:33,460
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

319
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,896
This is my valet, my
valet does not walk.

320
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,623
I said niggers on horses-

321
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:44,046
His name is Django, he's a free
man, he can ride what he pleases.

322
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:45,743
Not on my property.

323
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:47,686
Not around my niggers he can't.

324
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:49,963
My good sir...

325
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,998
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

326
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,769
Allow me to unring this bell.

327
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:59,691
My name is Dr. King Schultz,
this is my valet Django,

328
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:02,490
and these are our
horses Tony and Fritz.

329
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:07,036
Mr. Bennett,

330
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:12,187
I've been lead to believe that you
are a gentleman, and a business man.

331
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:15,473
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas

332
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,656
to Tennessee to parley with you now.

333
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:22,737
I wish to purchase one
of your nigger gals.

334
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:29,586
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals?

335
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:31,693
No appointment, no nuttin'?

336
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,506
Oh, I'm afraid so.

337
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:38,096
Well what if I had to say I don't
like you, or your fancy pants nigger,

338
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,179
and I wouldn't sell
you a tinkers damn.

339
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:42,648
Now what'cha gotta say about that?

340
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,184
Mr. Bennett,

341
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:51,489
if you are the business man I've
been led to believe you to be,

342
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,289
I have five thousand things, I might
say, that could change your mind.

343
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:04,285
Well com'on inside, and get
yourself somethin' cool to drink.

344
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:06,913
- Huh?
- Hm-hm.

345
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,859
Oh maybe, while we discuss business,

346
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,296
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

347
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:26,222
to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.

348
00:30:26,361 --> 00:30:28,604
Oh, absolutely! Eh, Betina!

349
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,675
Yessir, Big Daddy?

350
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,013
Eh... What's your Jimmie name again?

351
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,849
- Django.
- Django.

352
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:36,527
Betina sugar, could
you take Django there,

353
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,746
and take him around the grounds here
to show him all the pretty stuff.

354
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,207
As you please, Big Daddy.

355
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,378
Oh, Mr. Bennett,

356
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:47,618
I must remind you Django is a free
man. He cannot be treated like a slave.

357
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:51,352
Within the bounds of good taste, he must
be treated as an extension of myself.

358
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,611
Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?

359
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:54,427
Yes, sir?

360
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:56,607
Django isn't a slave.

361
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,544
Django is a free man. You understand?

362
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:03,196
You can't treat him like any of
these other niggers around here,

363
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:06,027
cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?

364
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,036
You wan' I should treat
him like white folks?

365
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:10,161
No.

366
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,254
That's not what I said.

367
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,891
Then I don't know
what'cha want, Big Daddy.

368
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:17,704
Yes... I can see that.

369
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,106
Uh...

370
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:24,074
What's the name of that peckawood boy
from town that works with the glass?

371
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,666
His mama works at the lumber yard.

372
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,127
Oh, you mean Jerry.

373
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,913
That's the boy's name, Jerry!

374
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,374
You know Jerry, don't you sugar?

375
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,686
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

376
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,561
Well that's it then...

377
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,362
You just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.

378
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,359
The house we just left
from, is the big house.

379
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:50,417
Big daddy call it
that, cause it's big.

380
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,816
That there is the pantry.

381
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,798
That's where Bid Daddy
hang out his day meat.

382
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,662
Full o'squirrels.

383
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:03,771
What'cha do for your massa'?

384
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:05,840
Didn't you hear him
tell ya I ain't no slave?

385
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,105
So you really free?

386
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,352
Yes. I as free.

387
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,869
You mean you wanna dress like that?

388
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,074
Betina, I need to ask you something.

389
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,332
What'cho want?

390
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:17,012
I'm lookin' for three white men.

391
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,311
Three brothers, overseers. Their
name is Brittle. Do you know 'em?

392
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,225
Brittle?

393
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,676
Yes, Brittle. John
Brittle, Ellis Brittle,

394
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,637
Roger Brittle. Sometime
called Li'le Raj.

395
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,199
I don't know dem.

396
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,795
They could be usin' a different name.

397
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:33,300
They would have come to the
plantation this past year.

398
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:35,029
You mean The Shaffers?

399
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,157
Maybe. Three brother?

400
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:38,345
Ah-huh.

401
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:40,392
- Are they
here? - Ah-huh.

402
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,231
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

403
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,836
Well one's over in that field.

404
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,155
Old man Carrucan ain't going to
appreciate this now, she- she-

405
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:03,159
she work in a house, John,
you could mess her skin up,

406
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,557
and you gonna mess it up,
she ain't gonna be worth no-

407
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:06,080
she ain't gonna worth a damn thing.

408
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:07,309
Like the bible say...

409
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,016
Look, I told you, I was
the one to make her do it.

410
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,469
You're ready?

411
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:18,764
She the one who went up for me and,
thing about you we gettin' whipped now,

412
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,199
that should be me! That should be me
John, I been here long enough, you know me!

413
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:23,814
You know me a long time, now!

414
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,411
You know master Carrugen
ain't gonna appreciate this!

415
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:37,271
She's
- she's a house slave!

416
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:44,696
#Looking for freedom

417
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,280
#Looking for freedom ah-aah

418
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:01,938
Please, please now.

419
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:04,594
If this what you want, to keep me
funny fighting for each other, please...

420
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:14,225
I like the way you beg, boy.

421
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:19,716
Is that who you was lookin' for?

422
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:22,880
Yep.

423
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:25,525
Where the other two of 'em?

424
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,321
They by the stable, punishin'
Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

425
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,248
They whippin' Little Jody?

426
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,651
Point me in that direction.

427
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,176
You go to that tree,
and keep goin' that way.

428
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:44,676
Go git that white
man I came here with.

429
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:48,331
Com'on now. Com'on, Jody!

430
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:51,716
Let me all... get you set up!

431
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:54,283
And the Lord said the fear of ye...

432
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,358
and the dread of ye...

433
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:59,903
shall be on every beast of here.

434
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:04,354
Hey, gimme that of what?
You better gimme that arm,

435
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,486
you gotta gimme that arm!

436
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,566
Okay, she ready!

437
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:43,093
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

438
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:47,828
John Brittle!

439
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,529
Remember me?

440
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,013
I like the way you die, boy!

441
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,032
Goddamn
son-of-a-bitch!

442
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,594
Ya'all wanna see somethin'?

443
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:23,551
Ooh no!

444
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,283
Who are they?

445
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:39,720
That's Big John, and
that's little Raj.

446
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:41,252
Where's Ellis?

447
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:44,217
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

448
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:50,418
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

449
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,402
- Positive?
- I dunno.

450
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,033
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what positive means.

451
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:56,073
It means you're sure.

452
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,206
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

453
00:37:57,261 --> 00:37:58,822
Yes I'm sure it is Ellis Brittle.

454
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:13,924
I'm positive he dead.

455
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:19,917
Django!

456
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:24,105
Everybody calm down,

457
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,496
we mean no one else any harm.

458
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,292
Who are you two jokers?

459
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,271
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

460
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:34,675
of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America,

461
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:38,338
the man to my left is Django
Freeman, he's my deputy.

462
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:41,030
In my pocket is a warrant

463
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:45,448
signed by circuit court judge Henry
Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas,

464
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:50,120
for the arrest and
capture, dead or alive, of

465
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:54,599
John Brittle, Roger
Brittle, and Ellis Brittle.

466
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,013
They've gone by the name Shaffer.

467
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:02,214
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers real name was Brittle.

468
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:05,989
These are wanted men. The
law wants them for murder.

469
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:10,395
Now I reiterate, the
warrant states dead or alive,

470
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:13,705
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

471
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:17,241
we were operating within
our legal boundaries.

472
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,772
I realize...

473
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:22,768
passions are high,

474
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,963
but I must warn you,

475
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:28,336
the penalty for taking deadly
force against a office of the court

476
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,389
in the performance of his duty is,

477
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,055
you will be hung by the
neck until you're dead.

478
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:41,266
May I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

479
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:44,951
Gimmie.

480
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,421
Satisfied?

481
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:10,904
May I have that back, please?

482
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,825
Get off my land.

483
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:19,492
Post haste.

484
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:23,655
Load up the bodies
as quickly as you can,

485
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:25,533
and let's get out of here.

486
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:51,798
Hell...

487
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:54,390
That's 'em sonsabitches.

488
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,526
Now unless they start shootin'
first... nobody shoot 'em.

489
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,868
That's way too simple
for these jokers.

490
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,649
We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death.

491
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,521
And I'm gonna personally strip
and clip that garboon myself.

492
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:10,975
Damn...

493
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,031
I can't see fuckin'
shit outta this thing.

494
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,196
We ready, or what?

495
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:20,295
Ah hold on, I'm fuckin'
with my eye holes.

496
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:22,536
Oh shit.

497
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,825
I just made it worse.

498
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Who made this goddamn shit?

499
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,976
Willard's wife.

500
00:42:28,055 --> 00:42:29,990
WÐµll mÐ°kÐµ yÐ¾u Ð¾wn
gÐ¾ddÐ°mn mÐ°Ñ•kÑ•!

501
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:33,906
Look, nobody's sayin' they
don't appreciate what Jenny did.

502
00:42:33,938 --> 00:42:36,469
Well if all I hadda do
was cut a hole in a bag,

503
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:38,430
I coulda cut it better than this.

504
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,910
How 'bout you Robert, can you see?

505
00:42:41,317 --> 00:42:42,728
Not too good.

506
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:47,190
I mean, if I don't move my head, I
can see pretty good, more or less.

507
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:50,945
But when I start ridin', the bag's
moving all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

508
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:52,382
Oh shit!

509
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,421
I just made mine worse.

510
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:59,755
Anybody bring any extra bags?

511
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,153
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

512
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:03,903
I'm just asking.

513
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,901
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

514
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,534
Oh well Shitfire!

515
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:10,635
If you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.

516
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:12,500
Well I can't see in
this fucking thing!

517
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:15,678
I can't breathe in this fucking thing,
and I can't ride in this fucking thing!

518
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:17,724
Well fuck all y'all, I'm going home!

519
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,449
Ya know I watched
my wife work all day

520
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:24,368
gettin' thirty bags to get ready
for you ungrateful sonsabitches,

521
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:27,994
and all I hear is criticize,
criticize, criticize.

522
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,689
From now on, don't ask
me or mine for nothin'!

523
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:33,877
Now look...

524
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,762
Let's not forget why we're here.

525
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,595
We gotta killer nigger
over that hill there.

526
00:43:39,103 --> 00:43:40,595
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

527
00:43:40,629 --> 00:43:41,924
Okay, I'm confused.

528
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:43,746
Are the bags on or off.

529
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:49,681
I think... we all think...
the bags was a nice idea.

530
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:50,712
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

531
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:54,788
But not pointing 'ny fingers,
they could have been done better.

532
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:59,036
So how about... no bags this time,

533
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:04,781
but next time, we do the bags
right, and then we go full regalia.

534
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,944
I get my bag off.

535
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:08,163
Wait a minute!

536
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:10,007
I didn't say no bags.

537
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,353
But nobody can see.

538
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:13,772
So?

539
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:16,069
So, it be nice to see.

540
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:18,546
Goddamit! This is a raid!

541
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:21,747
I can't see, you can't see. So what?

542
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,317
All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see!

543
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:25,797
That's a raid!

544
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:31,117
Where's this shit!

545
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:33,283
There he is!

546
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:35,895
Get that nigger out
from under 'at wagon.

547
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:38,449
And get that nigger
lover out o'the wagon!

548
00:44:38,604 --> 00:44:39,746
That nigger ain't down here!

549
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:40,921
- They're gone!
- What?

550
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,689
- They tricked us!
- Well where are they?

551
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:44,369
Auf wiedersehen.

552
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:53,899
Bull time.

553
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:57,601
We get 'em now.

554
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:04,468
Cowards tend to do that.

555
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,670
Goddammit!

556
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:20,015
Would you care to?

557
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,017
I can't see shit out of this...

558
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:30,874
He's getting away.

559
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:31,803
I got 'em.

560
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,522
Big Daddy's getting away.

561
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:37,129
I got 'em.

562
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:53,221
Got 'em.

563
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:00,810
For kids, ain't that short.

564
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:14,886
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters were German?

565
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:17,353
Broomhilda is a German name.

566
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,595
If they named her, it stands
to reason they'd be German.

567
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:23,286
Lots of gals where you
from named Broomhilda?

568
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:26,966
Broomhilda is the name of a character

569
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:30,582
in the most popular of
all the German legends.

570
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:33,228
There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?

571
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,533
Oh yes, there is.

572
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,468
Do you know it?

573
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,390
Every German knows that story.

574
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,891
Would you like me to tell you?

575
00:46:54,027 --> 00:46:55,269
Well...

576
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:59,684
Broomhilda was a... princess.

577
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:06,361
She was the daughter of
Wotan, the god of all gods.

578
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:10,114
Anyway, her father
is really mad at her.

579
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:11,773
What she do?

580
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:16,364
I can't exactly remember. I think
she disobeys him in some way.

581
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:20,367
So he puts her on
top of the mountain.

582
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:22,178
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

583
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:25,662
It's a German legend, there's always
going to be a mountain in there somewhere.

584
00:47:26,186 --> 00:47:30,183
And he puts a fire breathing
dragon there to guard the mountain.

585
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:34,373
And he surrounds her...

586
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:37,662
in a circle of hellfire.

587
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,442
And there, Broomhilda shall remain,

588
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,840
unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

589
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,419
Does a fella arise?

590
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:55,341
Yes Django. As a
matter of fact, he does.

591
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,886
A fella named Sigfried.

592
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,140
Does Sigfried save her?

593
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:04,055
Quite spectacularly so.

594
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,779
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

595
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:13,846
He slays the dragon, because
he's not afraid of him.

596
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,008
And he walks through hellfire...

597
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,672
because Broomhilda's worth it.

598
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:27,376
I know how he feel.

599
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:31,798
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

600
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:41,371
Now... Look... Django...

601
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,212
I don't doubt that one day
you will save your lady love.

602
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,731
But I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscious.

603
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:58,225
Slave Washington, in Mississippi,
isn't a place for you to visit.

604
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,921
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

605
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:06,782
But let me ask you a question.

606
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,385
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

607
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:20,093
Kill white folks, and
they pay you for it?

608
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:22,448
What's not to like?

609
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,101
And I have to admit,
we make a good team.

610
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:28,133
I thought you was mad at me for
killin' Big John and Lit'le Raj?

611
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,426
Yeah, on that occasion,
you were a tad overzealous,

612
00:49:30,528 --> 00:49:32,048
but normally, that's a good thing.

613
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:35,627
How'd you like to
partner up for the winter?

614
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,630
What'd ya mean partner up?

615
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:41,827
You work with me through the
winter till the snow melts.

616
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:45,574
I give you a third of my bounties.

617
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:50,212
So we make some money this
winter, and when the snow melts,

618
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:56,531
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.

619
00:50:01,106 --> 00:50:02,806
Why you care what happen to me?

620
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,440
Why you care if I find my wife?

621
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:08,255
Frankly...

622
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:12,312
I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

623
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:16,032
And now that I have, I feel
vaguely responsible for you.

624
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:20,837
Plus when a German meets a real life
Sigfried, that's kind of a big deal.

625
00:50:23,715 --> 00:50:26,298
As a German, I'm obliged to help you

626
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,979
on your quest to rescue
your beloved Broomhilda.

627
00:52:46,617 --> 00:52:50,958
Ooh, what happened to mister ""I
wanna shoot white folks for money""?

628
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,901
His son's with him.

629
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:56,018
Well good. He'll have
a loved one with him.

630
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:58,404
Maybe even share a last word.

631
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:02,639
That's better then most of them get,

632
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:05,029
and a damn sight
better then he deserves.

633
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:15,141
Put down the rifle.

634
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:19,164
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

635
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,065
Just take out Smitty
Bacall's handbill.

636
00:53:26,558 --> 00:53:27,782
Read it aloud.

637
00:53:28,924 --> 00:53:30,946
Consider that today's lesson.

638
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:35,664
Wanted, dead or alive.

639
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,289
Smitty Bacall and
the Smitty Bacall...

640
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:42,493
gang.

641
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,969
For murder and stagecoach ro...

642
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:49,652
robbery.

643
00:53:50,181 --> 00:53:51,835
Seven zero zero ze-

644
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:52,663
Seven thousand.

645
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:54,499
- Seven-
- Thousand.

646
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:58,457
""Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall,

647
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:05,221
one thousand and five hundred
dollars for each of his gang

648
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:08,944
- memb...
- members.

649
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:14,153
Known members of the Smitty
Bacall Gang are as fellows,

650
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:15,895
- follows.
- follows.

651
00:54:16,637 --> 00:54:19,603
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and...

652
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:22,939
Crazy Craig Koons.

653
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:26,884
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

654
00:54:27,156 --> 00:54:29,864
If Smitty Bacall wanted to
start a farm at twenty-two,

655
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:31,932
they would never have printed that.

656
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:35,750
But Smitty Bacall wanted
to rob stagecoaches,

657
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:38,643
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

658
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:42,460
D'you want to save your
wife by doing what I do?

659
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,012
This is what I do.

660
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:48,653
I kill people, and sell
their corpses for cash.

661
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,681
This corpse is worth
seven thousand dollars.

662
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:55,995
Now quit your
pussyfootin' and shoot him.

663
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:07,299
Pa?

664
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,768
Pa!

665
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:18,553
Here...

666
00:55:19,137 --> 00:55:21,298
You need to keep this
Smitty Bacall handbill.

667
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:22,197
Why?

668
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:23,664
It's good luck.

669
00:55:23,797 --> 00:55:26,523
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

670
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:16,364
That's accurate.

671
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:26,928
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

672
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:30,031
Who the hell have you got there?

673
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,629
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

674
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:35,758
Who the hell is the
Wilson-Lowe Gang?

675
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,982
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby
Lowe, and three of their acolytes.

676
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:42,357
Huh.

677
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,052
Well just leave 'em out here,
they ain't goin' nowhere.

678
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:48,955
Let's comin' outta the snowy
snow and git yourself some coffee.

679
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:52,080
Had a birthday
yesterday, got some cake!

680
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,818
Pretty good.

681
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:17,589
Move along!

682
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,665
Do it, walk!

683
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:28,585
Keep moving.

684
00:58:32,324 --> 00:58:35,124
Don't let that mud slow
you down, keep going.

685
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,265
Keep on.

686
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,956
Broomhilda Von Shaft,
age twenty-seven,

687
00:58:58,649 --> 00:59:00,469
""r"" on right cheek...

688
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:03,810
Calvin Candy.

689
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:08,397
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.

690
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:10,367
Candyland?

691
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:11,533
Oh so you've heard of it?

692
00:59:11,572 --> 00:59:13,476
Ain't no slave that
ain't heard of Candyland.

693
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:16,124
Well, apparently that's
where you wife is,

694
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,473
and that's the repelling
gentleman who owns her.

695
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:22,119
Let's just hope she works in
the out, slaying in the field.

696
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:23,820
Oh no, she ain't in the field, mate.

697
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,256
She... she pretty.

698
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,644
and she a tall girl, too.

699
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,416
The one you tore
back up on the nag...

700
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:35,715
he burnt her runaway on her cheek.

701
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:38,410
They got damned.

702
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:46,421
She no field nigger, but she ain't good
enough for the house no more either.

703
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:48,427
They're gonna try to
make her comfort girl.

704
00:59:48,456 --> 00:59:50,193
What's a comfort
- Oh.

705
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:53,075
Now while I got freedom...

706
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:55,691
Now while I got my gun.

707
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,589
So do we offer to buy her?

708
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:04,309
So...

709
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,307
say...

710
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:12,536
a man wants to buy a horse...

711
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,997
needs to buy a horse.

712
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:19,553
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
he knocks on the farmer's door,

713
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:23,005
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
And you know what the farmer says,

714
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,364
the farmer says: ""No"".

715
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,317
Well I say: fuck that farmer.

716
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:31,383
And I'm stealin' that horse.

717
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:36,318
Fair enough, but now you are horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.

718
01:00:36,483 --> 01:00:38,840
Not to mention the horse goes
back to its original owner,

719
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:40,691
because the horse is
still its property.

720
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:44,359
We need her and we
need a bill of sale.

721
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,154
But if we ain't gonna try to
buy, then how we gonna get it?

722
01:00:48,038 --> 01:00:51,879
May I offer an alternative
plan for action?

723
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,390
Go ahead.

724
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:59,806
The man walks up to the farmer's
farm, he knocks on the farmer's door,

725
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:05,913
and asks not to buy
the horse, but the farm,

726
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:12,027
and makes an offer so ridiculous,
the farmer's forced to say yes.

727
01:01:12,761 --> 01:01:14,448
We're gonna offer to buy Candyland?

728
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:19,079
No, it's far too big, but apparently,
this farmer ain't all about the farm.

729
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:22,741
How much do you know
about mandingo fighting?

730
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:23,687
What?

731
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:28,637
Can you convincingly masquerade of someone
who's an expert on mandingo fighting?

732
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,828
Why?

733
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:33,695
Because my character is that of
a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,

734
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,294
here in Greenville to buy my
way into the mandingo fight game,

735
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:41,230
and your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.

736
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:43,079
They call that ""One-Eyed Charly"".

737
01:01:46,471 --> 01:01:47,851
Bonjour.

738
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:51,111
Bonsoir, p'tite femme noire,

739
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,712
we are here to see Mr. Calvin Candy.

740
01:01:54,025 --> 01:01:55,585
Enter.

741
01:01:58,242 --> 01:01:59,642
Thank you.

742
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:02,638
You want me to play a black slaver?

743
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:05,737
Ain't nothin lower
than a black slaver.

744
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:09,242
A black slaver is lower
than a head house nigger.

745
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:12,220
And buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.

746
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,768
Then play him that way,

747
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:19,784
give me your black slaver.

748
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,116
Dr. Schultz!

749
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:34,788
Good to see you again.

750
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:36,329
Mr. Moguy.

751
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:40,322
Thank you for your assistance in creating
the opportunity for this appointment.

752
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:41,898
Nonsense, it's my job.

753
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:45,674
So, this is the One-Eyed
Charly I've heard so much about.

754
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:47,705
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

755
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:50,797
Django, this is Mr. Candie's
lawyer, Leonide Moguy.

756
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,607
Just call me Leo.

757
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:56,290
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar
room, y'all wanna follow me?

758
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:58,831
How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

759
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:03,126
Oh, Calvin's father and I were about eleven
when we went to boarding school together.

760
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:06,434
Calvins' father father
put me through law school.

761
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:09,669
One could almost say, I was
raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

762
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:12,060
One could almost say, you's a nigger.

763
01:03:12,429 --> 01:03:13,989
What did you say?

764
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:15,218
I say...

765
01:03:15,243 --> 01:03:17,343
Real nothing, he's just being cheeky.

766
01:03:17,478 --> 01:03:21,923
Now, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

767
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,108
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

768
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:26,008
Ah, what civilized people aren't?

769
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,477
And he prefers Monsieur
Candie to Mister Candie.

770
01:03:28,516 --> 01:03:30,616
Hmm, si c'est cela qu'il prÃ©fÃ¨re.

771
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:35,029
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

772
01:03:38,244 --> 01:03:40,569
Get back on top now, turn around.

773
01:03:40,632 --> 01:03:41,700
There you go.

774
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:43,616
There you go.

775
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:48,283
Why do you want to get
in the mandingo business?

776
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,146
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

777
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:58,854
Quit stalling now.
Answer the question.

778
01:04:01,294 --> 01:04:02,940
The awful truth?

779
01:04:03,197 --> 01:04:04,862
Pff, I'm bored.

780
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:06,812
This seems like a good bit of fun.

781
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,250
Well, come on over.

782
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:17,132
We got us a fight goin' on,
that's a good bit of fun.

783
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:23,131
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

784
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,218
You don't go ahead in a house,
white man, even I know that.

785
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:45,068
Dr. Schultz... -
What a real pleasure-

786
01:04:45,076 --> 01:04:46,689
Keep fighting, niggers!

787
01:04:46,775 --> 01:04:48,306
.. and I might add, an honor.

788
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:51,889
Honored to meet you, please have
a seat, the pleasure's all mine.

789
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,651
Get Freeman Django
here whatever he wants.

790
01:04:55,379 --> 01:04:57,199
And I'll have sweet gin bourbon.

791
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,598
You go way, boy, you
do what I tell you!

792
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:22,468
He's got big and strong!

793
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:24,524
Com'on now!

794
01:05:24,684 --> 01:05:27,484
Ah, he's not doing what
I told him. For God sake.

795
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:31,327
Bravo, Luigi, cosi e
dai. De casse piu rapido.

796
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:34,289
Com'on now boys, this
a fight to the death!

797
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:37,271
Hit that animal or you're ain't!

798
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:45,226
Ecco i con la spola tappeto.
La spola tappeto giÃ¹.

799
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:47,577
Big Fred, com'on!

800
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:50,091
Turn him around, now!

801
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:55,660
Use your strength, boy!

802
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,259
Com'on now, use your strength!

803
01:06:00,446 --> 01:06:01,846
There you go!

804
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:04,617
There you go!

805
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:05,808
Look at that!

806
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,829
Yeah I told you, this is a wild man.

807
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:12,065
Do what I told you, boy.

808
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:13,282
Here you go!

809
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:15,306
Ah. No! Aah!

810
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:18,210
Do what I told you.
Ground him back, boy.

811
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,475
Ground him back!

812
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:23,715
Uh, you no lose!

813
01:06:31,351 --> 01:06:33,226
No! No!

814
01:06:44,526 --> 01:06:45,683
Finish him.

815
01:06:49,642 --> 01:06:51,462
Go on, boy, finish him!

816
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:57,519
That's why they call him big Fred!

817
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,261
Worth every penny.

818
01:06:59,301 --> 01:07:01,050
Well, arrivederchi, Luigi!

819
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:03,605
Com'on up now boy,
get yourself a rest,

820
01:07:03,613 --> 01:07:06,469
you did a fine job, a real fine job.

821
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:08,231
Proceed in.

822
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:31,226
Tequila.

823
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,437
What's your name?

824
01:07:44,923 --> 01:07:46,208
Django.

825
01:07:48,757 --> 01:07:50,577
Can you spell it?

826
01:07:52,523 --> 01:07:56,513
D, J, A, N, G, O.

827
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:00,021
The D is silent.

828
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:01,277
I know.

829
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:09,393
Umberto, andiamo.

830
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,576
Mr. Moguy,

831
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,784
I want you to take
care o' my new boy here.

832
01:08:13,034 --> 01:08:14,930
You find him a room with a soft bed,

833
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:17,272
and you bring him up a
pony to lick his pawl.

834
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:20,591
You be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow mornin' now, you hear?

835
01:08:20,669 --> 01:08:21,489
Yessir, Mr. Candy.

836
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:25,347
Oh before you go, Roscoe,
get Fred here a tall beer.

837
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,978
You enjoy that, boy.

838
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,603
You've earned it.

839
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,810
Yessir.

840
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:44,782
What's your name, boy?

841
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:47,016
His name is Django Freeman.

842
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:48,529
Hm-hm.

843
01:08:51,018 --> 01:08:52,242
Where did ya dig him up?

844
01:08:52,269 --> 01:08:56,008
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

845
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,469
I've heard tell about you.

846
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,176
I heard you've been telling ev'rybody
that mandingos are not damn good,

847
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:06,543
ain't nothing nobody is selling
is worth buying, I'm curious.

848
01:09:07,295 --> 01:09:09,394
What makes you such
a mandingo expert?

849
01:09:11,638 --> 01:09:14,038
I'm curious what
makes you so curious?

850
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:19,285
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down Butch.

851
01:09:20,643 --> 01:09:22,121
No offense given...

852
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:23,736
None taken.

853
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,330
Uh, Monsieur Candie...

854
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:29,554
Uhm, I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

855
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:30,729
One.

856
01:09:31,684 --> 01:09:34,775
You do not have anything to drink,
can I get you a tasty refreshment.

857
01:09:34,915 --> 01:09:36,744
Yes! I'll have a beer.

858
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:37,931
Wunderbar.

859
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:40,036
Roscoe, a beer for
the man with the beard,

860
01:09:40,046 --> 01:09:43,442
and I will have a Polynesian
Pearl Diver, do no spill the rum.

861
01:09:44,028 --> 01:09:45,148
Doc...

862
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:49,872
I'm a seasoned slaver, you are
- well, you are a neophyte,

863
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:54,730
I'm simply trying to ascertain if this
cowboy here is taking advantage of you.

864
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:59,329
With all due respect,
Monsieur Candie,

865
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,223
I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

866
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:06,846
I sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.

867
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:10,171
I was under the impression
when you granted me an audience,

868
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:12,532
it would be to discuss business.

869
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,210
But we weren't talking business yet.

870
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:19,756
We were discussing my curiosity.

871
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:26,158
Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.

872
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,427
Sheba,

873
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:31,604
you stay right there.

874
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,078
I know you didn't name me.

875
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:36,454
Prost.

876
01:10:36,703 --> 01:10:37,823
Jambo.

877
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:40,170
Now according to Moguy,

878
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:44,881
if I do business with you, I'm
doin' business with both of y'all.

879
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:47,469
He does the eyeballin', you
the billfold, is that it?

880
01:10:47,587 --> 01:10:52,030
Well, you don't make it sound too
flattering, but more or less, yeah.

881
01:10:53,788 --> 01:10:54,908
So...

882
01:10:55,457 --> 01:10:56,857
Bright Boy,

883
01:10:57,077 --> 01:10:59,385
Moguy tells me you looked
over my African flesh,

884
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:01,301
and you was none too impressed, huh?

885
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:03,305
Not for top dollar.

886
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:07,248
Well then we got nothing
more to talk about.

887
01:11:07,457 --> 01:11:09,525
You see, you wanna buy a
beat ass nigger from me,

888
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:12,081
those was all the beat ass
niggers I wanna sell, so...

889
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:14,616
He don't wanna buy the
niggers you wanna sell.

890
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:17,944
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

891
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:22,522
I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

892
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,420
Well, hm. You won't sell your best.

893
01:11:28,657 --> 01:11:30,579
You won't even sell your second best.

894
01:11:31,392 --> 01:11:34,655
But your third best you don't
want to sell him either...

895
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:38,926
but if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

896
01:11:40,513 --> 01:11:42,793
who knows what could happen?

897
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:46,686
And what do you consider ridiculous?

898
01:11:47,398 --> 01:11:51,981
For a truly talented specimen,
well ""The Right Nigger""?

899
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:55,318
How much would you say, Django?

900
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,500
Twelve thousand dollars.

901
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:06,606
Gentlemen...

902
01:12:07,008 --> 01:12:08,772
You had my curiosity.

903
01:12:09,217 --> 01:12:10,902
Now you have my attention.

904
01:12:25,062 --> 01:12:27,140
Willie... Willie.

905
01:12:27,187 --> 01:12:29,007
Hold up! Hold up.

906
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:30,331
Aah.

907
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:32,057
Good morning, gentlemen.

908
01:12:32,144 --> 01:12:35,204
Good Dr. Schultz.
Beautiful morning isn't it?

909
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,298
You couldn't have
picked a better one.

910
01:12:37,345 --> 01:12:40,360
Please, won't you take a ride
with us here in the Victorian.

911
01:12:40,392 --> 01:12:42,068
Oh, thank you very much.

912
01:12:42,116 --> 01:12:44,270
Tie your horse up back there.

913
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:53,464
Django!

914
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,825
Well I part company from many
of my phenologist colleagues,

915
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:05,124
cause I believe there's
a level above bright,

916
01:13:05,665 --> 01:13:11,155
above talented, above loyal
that a nigger can aspire.

917
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:16,664
Say one nigger that just
pops up on ten thousand.

918
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,531
The exceptional nigger.

919
01:13:19,412 --> 01:13:21,261
Bright day uh, Bright Boy?

920
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,798
Sun is up.

921
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:26,574
Shinin' on all of us.

922
01:13:31,457 --> 01:13:33,277
Have a seat, Doc.

923
01:13:34,759 --> 01:13:35,943
Great an honor.

924
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:37,388
The honor is all ours.

925
01:13:37,506 --> 01:13:38,091
Thank you.

926
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:44,433
.. but I do believe that given time,
exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here,

927
01:13:45,348 --> 01:13:47,470
will come if not freedom...

928
01:13:48,245 --> 01:13:49,645
more freedom...

929
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:53,011
Bright Boy,

930
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,962
you are that one in ten thousand.

931
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:59,334
The name of the game is keep
up, not catch up, nigger.

932
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,512
Touch your guns, you're dead.

933
01:14:16,521 --> 01:14:18,341
Everybody calm down!

934
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:20,940
I saw the whole thing, no harm done.

935
01:14:20,971 --> 01:14:22,633
Are you- are you
kiddin' me, this nigger-

936
01:14:22,664 --> 01:14:26,164
I said no harm done! Now take
your hands off your pistol!

937
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,916
Butch!

938
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,070
That means you too.

939
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,653
Ev'rybody stop
antagonizing my guests.

940
01:14:36,355 --> 01:14:37,230
Who!

941
01:14:37,497 --> 01:14:39,119
Git back upon your horse.

942
01:14:39,436 --> 01:14:40,871
He broke my collarbone!

943
01:14:40,965 --> 01:14:45,572
For God sake, somebody please help
Who here back upon his goddamn horse.

944
01:14:46,368 --> 01:14:48,631
Ooh, now you are one lucky nigger.

945
01:14:49,858 --> 01:14:51,683
You got to listen to
your boss, white boy.

946
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,127
Oh I'm a good walk in
any moonlight for you.

947
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:56,145
You wanna hold my hand?

948
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:05,215
Willie! Take us home.

949
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,549
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

950
01:16:04,654 --> 01:16:05,668
No sir.

951
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:08,134
You wan' a boot heel in it?

952
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:09,504
No sir.

953
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,922
Then keep your goddamn
eyeballs off me.

954
01:16:13,089 --> 01:16:16,125
Flash that bad look at me again,
I give you a reason not to like me.

955
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,360
Now move, nigger!

956
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,925
You niggers gonna understand
somethin' 'bout me.

957
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:23,938
I'm worse than any
o'these white men here.

958
01:16:24,235 --> 01:16:27,571
You keep them eyelash inside your ass,
you keep them goddamn eyeballs off me.

959
01:16:27,853 --> 01:16:31,053
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't it?

960
01:16:31,109 --> 01:16:32,405
Indeed!

961
01:16:34,959 --> 01:16:38,152
May you stop for a moment, so I
may put put a word in my man's ear?

962
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:42,249
Yeah, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimen of Candyland,

963
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:45,662
so before that moment, it
would be good if I could have

964
01:16:45,663 --> 01:16:49,723
a confidential strategy
meeting with my... confident.

965
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:54,829
You mind tellin' me
what the hell you doing?

966
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:57,439
I've confirmed that
Broomhilda's at Candyland.

967
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:02,431
Are you sure it's her?

968
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,872
He didn't call her by name,
but she's a young lady,

969
01:17:04,897 --> 01:17:06,848
whip marks on her
back, and speaks German.

970
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,362
Now while it's not wise to assume,

971
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,791
in this instance, I
think it's pretty safe.

972
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:13,301
Point being...

973
01:17:13,656 --> 01:17:16,476
don't get so carried away
with your retribution.

974
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:18,758
We lose sight on why we're here.

975
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,081
You think I lost sight, did I?

976
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:23,070
Yes, I do! Stop antagonizing Candy!

977
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:28,639
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get both of us killed,

978
01:17:28,663 --> 01:17:33,410
and I, for one, don't intend to die in
Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U. S. A.

979
01:17:33,652 --> 01:17:36,384
I'm not antagonizing.
I'm intriguing him.

980
01:17:36,673 --> 01:17:39,405
You're yelling abuse
of these poor slaves!

981
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:42,006
I recall the man...

982
01:17:42,444 --> 01:17:45,762
who had me killed another
man in front o' his son,

983
01:17:45,848 --> 01:17:47,205
and he didn't bat an eye.

984
01:17:49,056 --> 01:17:50,456
Remember that?

985
01:17:52,377 --> 01:17:53,663
Yeah of course I remember!

986
01:17:53,765 --> 01:17:55,273
What you said was...

987
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:56,827
You said, this ain't my word...

988
01:17:58,355 --> 01:18:00,094
""In my word you got to get dirty"".

989
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,071
So that's what I'm
doing. I'm getting dirty.

990
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:11,013
Well you're paraphrasing
a tad, but...

991
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:14,409
that was it generally, just...

992
01:18:18,423 --> 01:18:20,243
see you at Candyland.

993
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:28,704
Alright niggers!

994
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,199
Back at it.

995
01:18:31,376 --> 01:18:33,476
That means you too, moonlight.

996
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,262
I'll 'be. D'Artagnan!

997
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,954
Now well, why do a
fool thing like run off?

998
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:29,595
I can't fight no
more, Monsieur Candy.

999
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:31,247
Yes you can!

1000
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:33,633
YÐ¾u mÑ–ght nÐ¾t bÐµ Ð°blÐµ tÐ¾
wÑ–n, but yÐ¾ur Ð°Ñ•Ñ• ÑÐ°n fÑ–ght.

1001
01:19:34,704 --> 01:19:37,279
Mr. Stonesipher, would you
please shut these goddamn dogs up,

1002
01:19:37,317 --> 01:19:38,588
I cannot hear myself think!

1003
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:43,405
Hush now, Marsha! Hush up,
Marsha! Marsha, hush up!

1004
01:19:43,555 --> 01:19:46,897
Hey, get these goddamn
dogs away from this nigger!

1005
01:19:56,075 --> 01:19:57,895
Well now boy...

1006
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,742
Gidown o' that tree.
- Yes sir.

1007
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:25,251
How long was he lose?

1008
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:27,163
A night...

1009
01:20:27,851 --> 01:20:28,971
day...

1010
01:20:29,775 --> 01:20:30,895
Half the other night.

1011
01:20:32,388 --> 01:20:33,999
How far he git off property?

1012
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,880
Bout twenty miles off prop.

1013
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:38,638
Pretty fer, conside'ing
that limp he got.

1014
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:44,236
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1015
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:45,783
One of this new lot.

1016
01:20:47,445 --> 01:20:50,231
The way he looks now, a blind
Indian wouldn't bet a bead on 'em.

1017
01:20:50,294 --> 01:20:53,143
Please Mr. Candy, I ain't got
it, ain't it no more, I can't-

1018
01:20:53,178 --> 01:20:56,164
No no no no, now no beggin'...

1019
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,117
No playin' on my soft heart.

1020
01:21:03,169 --> 01:21:04,879
You're in trouble, now son.

1021
01:21:09,206 --> 01:21:12,006
I done paid 500 dollars for you...

1022
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:14,688
When I pay 500 dollars...

1023
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:19,389
I expect to get five fights outta a
nigga 'fore he rollover and play dead.

1024
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:22,949
Got to understand, I'm...
I'm running a business here!

1025
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,434
You
- you fought three fights.

1026
01:21:25,536 --> 01:21:26,830
But I won everyone!

1027
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:28,469
Yes you did. Yes you did,

1028
01:21:28,485 --> 01:21:31,424
but that last one, you muddled the
line between winning and losing.

1029
01:21:35,178 --> 01:21:36,998
Still the fact remain.

1030
01:21:37,538 --> 01:21:40,745
I pay 500 dollars, I
want five goddamn fights!

1031
01:21:41,592 --> 01:21:43,434
So what 'bout my five
hundred dollars, huh?

1032
01:21:45,789 --> 01:21:47,333
What about my five hundred dollars?

1033
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:50,722
You go n' reimburse me?!

1034
01:21:56,859 --> 01:21:59,813
You even know what reimburse means?

1035
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,349
I'll reimburse you!

1036
01:22:13,018 --> 01:22:14,418
You will?

1037
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:21,544
You pay 500 dollars...

1038
01:22:22,756 --> 01:22:26,160
for pratic'lly a one eyed
Ole'Joe ain't fit to push a broom?

1039
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,716
No, he won't.

1040
01:22:29,723 --> 01:22:31,728
He's just tired of you
toyin' with him, is all.

1041
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:34,306
Matter o' facts, so am I.

1042
01:22:35,276 --> 01:22:37,172
But we ain't payin' a
penny for that pickaninny,

1043
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:39,568
ain't got no use for 'em,
ain't that right, Doc?

1044
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,123
You heard 'em!

1045
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:56,159
I'm gonna have to excuse Mr.
Stonesipher slack jaw gaze, he...

1046
01:22:56,373 --> 01:22:58,902
he ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life.

1047
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:01,548
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1048
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:05,441
That right.

1049
01:23:06,392 --> 01:23:07,512
That matter...

1050
01:23:09,257 --> 01:23:11,077
Won't have that.

1051
01:23:16,645 --> 01:23:17,765
Now...

1052
01:23:19,073 --> 01:23:22,031
Sin'e as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1053
01:23:24,774 --> 01:23:27,745
you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger anyway I see fit?

1054
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,420
He's your nigger.

1055
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:35,812
Mr. Stonesipher?

1056
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,755
Let Marsha and her bitches send
D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1057
01:23:41,594 --> 01:23:44,685
Marsha! Git the nigger!

1058
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:25,881
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1059
01:24:25,882 --> 01:24:27,794
for a blood sport
like 'nigger fightin'?

1060
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:29,093
No.

1061
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:32,893
He just ain't use to seein' a
man ripped apart by dogs, is all.

1062
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,002
You are used to it?

1063
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:40,737
I'm just a little more use
to American's than he is.

1064
01:24:41,383 --> 01:24:44,413
Now... Monsieur Candy,

1065
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:46,624
whenever you're ready.

1066
01:24:47,023 --> 01:24:49,731
We rode five hours so you
could show off your stock.

1067
01:24:50,396 --> 01:24:52,216
Let's git to it.

1068
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:55,612
Cause as of now, if
he's an example...

1069
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:57,225
I ain't impressed.

1070
01:24:59,963 --> 01:25:01,363
Follow me.

1071
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:00,631
Line up to the left here now niggers.

1072
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,860
That's it.

1073
01:27:09,698 --> 01:27:11,578
You gimme a line, gimme a line.

1074
01:27:11,655 --> 01:27:13,710
Get in line here. Right now!

1075
01:28:13,245 --> 01:28:15,070
Hello, Steven my boy!

1076
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:17,356
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass.

1077
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:20,710
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1078
01:28:21,101 --> 01:28:22,661
Oh Steven, you have
nags for breakfast.

1079
01:28:23,075 --> 01:28:25,666
What's the matter, why so
ornery, you miss me, huh?

1080
01:28:25,696 --> 01:28:30,014
Oh-oh yes sir, I miss you
like a home miss flower,

1081
01:28:30,108 --> 01:28:34,176
like a - like a- a
baby miss Mum n' Teddy,

1082
01:28:34,824 --> 01:28:39,047
I miss you like I
misses a rock in my shoe.

1083
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,710
Now I ask you: who this
nigger, on that nag?

1084
01:28:45,758 --> 01:28:46,662
Hey Snowball.

1085
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,880
If you wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1086
01:28:52,475 --> 01:28:55,199
Just who the hell you
callin' Snowball, horse boy?

1087
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:58,081
I'll snap your black ass of
that nag there in the mud-

1088
01:28:58,144 --> 01:29:00,774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steven, Steven.

1089
01:29:01,562 --> 01:29:02,598
Let's keep it funny.

1090
01:29:03,031 --> 01:29:04,645
Django here is a Freeman.

1091
01:29:05,544 --> 01:29:07,344
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1092
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:09,967
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1093
01:29:10,334 --> 01:29:14,120
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Steven.

1094
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,917
Steven, this is Django.

1095
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,591
You two ought to hate each other.

1096
01:29:17,756 --> 01:29:21,863
Calvin, just who the hell is this
nigger you feel the need to entertain?

1097
01:29:21,967 --> 01:29:25,769
Django, and his friend in grey
here Dr. Schultz are customers,

1098
01:29:26,066 --> 01:29:27,618
and they are our guests, Steven,

1099
01:29:27,627 --> 01:29:31,568
and you, you old decrepit bastard,
are to show them every hospitality.

1100
01:29:31,607 --> 01:29:33,753
You understand that?
- Yessir, here I'm understandin',

1101
01:29:33,758 --> 01:29:35,727
but I don't know why I gotta
take lip off this nigger?

1102
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:38,761
You don't hafta know
why. Do you understand?

1103
01:29:39,263 --> 01:29:41,229
Yes sir, I understand.

1104
01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:42,443
Oh good!

1105
01:29:42,671 --> 01:29:45,692
They're spendin' the night, go up in
the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1106
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,581
He gonna stay in the Big House?

1107
01:29:48,647 --> 01:29:50,995
Steven, he's a
slaver. It's different.

1108
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:52,395
In the Big House?

1109
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:53,804
Well you gotta problem with that?

1110
01:29:53,827 --> 01:29:56,260
No, no no I got no problem with it,

1111
01:29:56,315 --> 01:29:59,117
with you I gotta problem with burnin'
the bed, the sheets, the pillow cases,

1112
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,156
ev'rything up when this
black ass motherfuckers gone!

1113
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:03,166
Now that is my problem,
they are mine to burn!

1114
01:30:03,305 --> 01:30:05,623
Now your problem right now
is making a good impression.

1115
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:07,920
And I want you to start
solving that problem right now,

1116
01:30:07,954 --> 01:30:09,584
and git them goddamn rooms ready!

1117
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:12,889
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.

1118
01:30:14,862 --> 01:30:16,262
Go on now.

1119
01:30:17,104 --> 01:30:19,554
Can't believe you brought a
nigger to stay in the Big House.

1120
01:30:19,641 --> 01:30:21,563
You get a rollin' over and
it's God man free right now.

1121
01:30:21,564 --> 01:30:22,220
He had a lip on you.

1122
01:30:22,412 --> 01:30:24,823
A nigger in the estate
part. What shit is that!?

1123
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:26,006
Now.

1124
01:30:26,199 --> 01:30:30,493
Where is my beautiful sister!

1125
01:30:31,019 --> 01:30:32,384
There she is!

1126
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:39,303
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
southern belle is my widowed sister.

1127
01:30:39,683 --> 01:30:43,610
Darling, you are a
diamond for tired eyes.

1128
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:48,211
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1129
01:30:48,274 --> 01:30:51,764
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charlie,
you'll git your ass up on that hill.

1130
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:53,139
Com'on Charlie, go on now.

1131
01:30:53,162 --> 01:30:55,144
Go, com'on now. You know where it is.

1132
01:30:55,613 --> 01:30:57,009
Like you on a rope!

1133
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:00,696
Niggers don't walk
'round here! Niggers run!

1134
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,623
- Ah, Monsieur Candie?
- Hmm?

1135
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,765
About that matter, about the
nigger girl we were talking about?

1136
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:09,804
Nigger girl?

1137
01:31:09,909 --> 01:31:13,208
Yeah, I believe you
mentioned she spoke German?

1138
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,780
Ah yes, Hildi, what about her?

1139
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:20,416
Do you think before the demonstration
you could send her around to my room?

1140
01:31:20,806 --> 01:31:23,077
You little Dickens, you!

1141
01:31:23,903 --> 01:31:24,803
I don't see why not.

1142
01:31:24,828 --> 01:31:27,958
Steven, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1143
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:31,446
get her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room.

1144
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:36,176
Actually, Monsieur Candie, it's
- it's somethin' I ain't tole you that yet.

1145
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:37,012
What?

1146
01:31:37,097 --> 01:31:39,712
Uh, Hildi in The Hot Box.

1147
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:43,024
What's she doin' there?

1148
01:31:43,117 --> 01:31:46,582
What 'cha think she doin' there,
in The Hot Box, she bein' punished.

1149
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,544
- What did she do?
- She ran off again.

1150
01:31:50,202 --> 01:31:52,965
Jesus Christ Steven, how many
people ran away while I was gone?

1151
01:31:53,012 --> 01:31:53,918
Two.

1152
01:31:54,365 --> 01:31:55,498
And when did she go?

1153
01:31:55,581 --> 01:31:58,581
Last night, they
- they brought her back this morning.

1154
01:31:58,785 --> 01:32:01,243
How bad did Stonesipher's
dogs tear her up?

1155
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:05,301
Lucky for her, they was out
chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1156
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:09,418
Bill and Cody went out lookin' for her,
found her and brought her back, uh...

1157
01:32:10,078 --> 01:32:11,209
Now she a little beat up,

1158
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:14,310
but she done that the all damn self,
runnin' through them damn bushes and shit.

1159
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:15,794
How long she been in the box?

1160
01:32:16,054 --> 01:32:19,044
How long ya think, she
been in there all damn day!

1161
01:32:19,177 --> 01:32:22,284
And the lit'le bitch got
ten more days be in there.

1162
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:23,845
Steven, take her out.

1163
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,207
Take her out, why?!

1164
01:32:25,293 --> 01:32:27,254
Because I said so, that's why.

1165
01:32:27,299 --> 01:32:29,179
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1166
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:33,812
Hildi is my nigger, Southern hospitality
dictates I make her available to him.

1167
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:36,119
But Monsieur Candie,
she just ran off.

1168
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:39,711
Jesus Christ Steven, what is the point
of havin' a nigger that speaks German,

1169
01:32:39,797 --> 01:32:42,177
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1170
01:32:42,381 --> 01:32:46,450
Now I realize it is inconvenient
but still, you take her ass out!

1171
01:32:46,591 --> 01:32:47,442
Yes sir.

1172
01:32:49,058 --> 01:32:52,329
Lara Lee, will you and Cora
be responsible for getting

1173
01:32:52,349 --> 01:32:55,349
Hilda cleaned up and
presentable for Dr. Schultz here?

1174
01:32:55,384 --> 01:32:56,784
Of course, darling.

1175
01:32:56,929 --> 01:33:01,924
Now gentlemen, I do apologize, but I'm
wearer for our travels beyond words,

1176
01:33:02,072 --> 01:33:04,893
it is time for me
to rest my tired ass.

1177
01:33:09,704 --> 01:33:12,389
Ya'all have heard the man,
get yar ass, all part of it.

1178
01:33:12,919 --> 01:33:14,646
Go! Come here!

1179
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:18,410
Get over there, get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to doctor

1180
01:33:18,418 --> 01:33:20,237
what
- what did you say your name is, Schut?

1181
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:21,847
- Schultz.
- Schultz!

1182
01:33:22,236 --> 01:33:24,022
Git her back over here, alright girl?

1183
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:25,469
Yes sir.

1184
01:34:43,464 --> 01:34:47,102
Hilda, you cominâ€™ with me, or you
gonna sleep in that lit'le box over here?

1185
01:36:22,237 --> 01:36:23,594
Hello ladies.

1186
01:36:23,688 --> 01:36:27,170
Dr. Schultz, may I
introduce to you Broomhilda.

1187
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,409
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1188
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:37,566
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Broomhilda.

1189
01:36:38,603 --> 01:36:40,931
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1190
01:36:41,002 --> 01:36:44,502
Well, it's not often a nigger
speaks German, don't you know?

1191
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:49,443
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1192
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:53,427
I could see all the passion you
inspire completely justified.

1193
01:36:57,632 --> 01:36:59,732
The doctor here speaks German!

1194
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:04,099
And I've been informed
you do as well?

1195
01:37:05,323 --> 01:37:07,486
Go ahead girl, speak a little German.

1196
01:37:15,937 --> 01:37:17,483
Astonishing.

1197
01:37:24,844 --> 01:37:27,313
- And I should
bring- - Much obliged.

1198
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:02,293
Don't be afraid.

1199
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:42,939
Pardon.

1200
01:40:37,459 --> 01:40:38,858
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

1201
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:50,444
You silver tongued devil you.

1202
01:41:06,701 --> 01:41:12,238
Look Monsieur Candie, they were all
fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1203
01:41:12,605 --> 01:41:15,423
But the best three, by far, were:

1204
01:41:15,751 --> 01:41:17,009
Sampson...

1205
01:41:17,648 --> 01:41:19,608
Well, what's his name again?
- Goldie.

1206
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:22,872
Goldie... and Eskimo Joe.

1207
01:41:23,505 --> 01:41:25,760
By the way, why is
he called Eskimo Joe?

1208
01:41:25,827 --> 01:41:29,237
Oh, you never know how these
nigger nicknames get started.

1209
01:41:29,352 --> 01:41:32,873
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold, who knows?

1210
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:37,253
Well, regardless,

1211
01:41:37,787 --> 01:41:39,409
Samson's your best,

1212
01:41:39,637 --> 01:41:40,995
we all know that,

1213
01:41:41,378 --> 01:41:45,117
you will never sell him, and
I can see why, he's a champion.

1214
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,742
Hm-hm-hm! All
three are champions.

1215
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:51,123
Samson's champion.

1216
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:53,820
Them other two pretty good.

1217
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:56,554
Calvin, what that
nigger- you let-

1218
01:41:56,563 --> 01:41:57,773
That's alright, that's alright.

1219
01:41:57,844 --> 01:41:59,802
You have to understand
Monsieur Candie,

1220
01:41:59,914 --> 01:42:03,607
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1221
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:07,749
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1222
01:42:07,796 --> 01:42:09,145
Is that right?

1223
01:42:09,421 --> 01:42:13,450
Hence... I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1224
01:42:14,777 --> 01:42:17,166
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1225
01:42:19,126 --> 01:42:21,235
He needs to have... panache.

1226
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:23,850
- Need to have what what what?
- Panache, hum...

1227
01:42:24,913 --> 01:42:27,575
- A sense of showmanship!
- Showmanship, yes.

1228
01:42:27,612 --> 01:42:31,359
I want to be able to bill him
him as the ""Black Hercules"".

1229
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:34,497
Black Hercules, isn't that clever?

1230
01:42:34,545 --> 01:42:36,003
More like niggerly.

1231
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:39,602
I said, and I quote:

1232
01:42:40,306 --> 01:42:45,573
""I would pay top dollar
for the Right Nigger"".

1233
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,944
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo
Joe is the wrong nigger per se...

1234
01:42:50,944 --> 01:42:53,488
but is he right as rain?

1235
01:42:54,814 --> 01:42:57,999
Dr. Schultz, I will have you know,

1236
01:42:58,065 --> 01:43:01,195
there is no one in the nigger
fight game that appreciates

1237
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:04,434
the value of showmanship more
than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.

1238
01:43:04,442 --> 01:43:05,442
Nobody.

1239
01:43:05,694 --> 01:43:09,184
But one must not forget the most
important thing in the nigger fight game.

1240
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:12,343
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1241
01:43:12,781 --> 01:43:16,997
Now that should be your first,
second, third, four, and fifth concern.

1242
01:43:17,135 --> 01:43:19,382
Now after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1243
01:43:19,435 --> 01:43:22,585
then you can start to
implement a grand design.

1244
01:43:23,504 --> 01:43:26,105
In other words, first thing is first.

1245
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,285
First thing is first.

1246
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:39,116
I see you two gettin' on.

1247
01:43:39,643 --> 01:43:41,323
Famously.

1248
01:43:41,667 --> 01:43:44,312
Oh Monsieur Candie, you
can't imagine what it's like

1249
01:43:44,313 --> 01:43:47,758
not to hear you native
tongue in four years.

1250
01:43:48,012 --> 01:43:50,673
Well hell, I can't imagine
two weeks in Boston.

1251
01:43:52,241 --> 01:43:55,498
Two weeks in Boston, oh that's your
- oh man!

1252
01:43:57,071 --> 01:43:58,633
Ah, two weeks in Boston!

1253
01:43:58,996 --> 01:44:04,462
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1254
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:08,948
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1255
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:11,008
Ah be careful now Doctor Schultz,

1256
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:13,801
you might have caught yourself
a little dose of Nigella.

1257
01:44:14,138 --> 01:44:16,503
Nigella's a powerful emotion, boy.

1258
01:44:16,558 --> 01:44:20,001
It's like a pool of black tar,
once it catches your ass, you can't-

1259
01:44:20,071 --> 01:44:21,876
Yessir, you can't.

1260
01:44:23,223 --> 01:44:27,728
I don't know doctor, you can lay on
all the German sweet talk you want, but

1261
01:44:27,776 --> 01:44:30,536
it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1262
01:44:34,302 --> 01:44:40,292
Well... naturally, it is the soaring
eagle that attracts her attention,

1263
01:44:40,383 --> 01:44:42,784
not the plucked chicken.

1264
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,646
Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself,

1265
01:44:46,664 --> 01:44:48,372
you are quite a dapper
European gentleman.

1266
01:44:48,396 --> 01:44:51,678
You gotta finish this, you got to put your
elbow in this, this is, do you hear me-

1267
01:44:51,728 --> 01:44:54,124
You know that nigger, don't ya?

1268
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:56,218
- Who?
- Who?

1269
01:44:56,294 --> 01:44:59,057
Don't who me bitch, you
know who I'm talking about!?

1270
01:45:01,078 --> 01:45:02,368
At the table?

1271
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:04,720
I don't know him.

1272
01:45:04,888 --> 01:45:06,107
You don't know him?

1273
01:45:06,606 --> 01:45:07,656
No.

1274
01:45:07,874 --> 01:45:09,054
No what?

1275
01:45:09,334 --> 01:45:10,741
No sir.

1276
01:45:15,544 --> 01:45:17,422
You wouldn't lie to
me now, would you?

1277
01:45:22,134 --> 01:45:23,342
Okay...

1278
01:45:24,707 --> 01:45:27,611
If
- if you say so.

1279
01:45:34,003 --> 01:45:37,320
Eskimo Joe's a quality
nigger, no doubt about it.

1280
01:45:39,181 --> 01:45:40,409
But if it was my money...

1281
01:45:42,053 --> 01:45:44,105
I wouldn't pay no twelve
thousand dollars for him.

1282
01:45:44,408 --> 01:45:46,293
What would your price be?

1283
01:45:46,885 --> 01:45:48,870
Well, if I was
inclined to be generous,

1284
01:45:48,948 --> 01:45:52,174
and I don't know why I would
be inclined to be generous...

1285
01:45:53,292 --> 01:45:54,360
nine thousand...

1286
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:56,832
maybe.

1287
01:45:57,725 --> 01:45:59,125
Dr. Schultz...

1288
01:45:59,709 --> 01:46:03,644
Let me reclarify how this
whole negotiation came about.

1289
01:46:03,988 --> 01:46:06,235
You see, it wasn't me who
came to you to sell a nigger,

1290
01:46:06,252 --> 01:46:07,032
Sure, it wasn't.

1291
01:46:07,054 --> 01:46:09,165
It was you who
approached me to buy one.

1292
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:10,047
Sure it was.

1293
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:12,833
Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,

1294
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:14,105
that ain't too far off from right,

1295
01:46:14,108 --> 01:46:15,769
and if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1296
01:46:15,784 --> 01:46:17,539
I could do so any day of the week.

1297
01:46:17,551 --> 01:46:18,566
Any day.

1298
01:46:18,982 --> 01:46:21,104
But like you said
in Greenville doctor,

1299
01:46:21,293 --> 01:46:22,963
I don't wanna sell 'em.

1300
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,531
It was only your ridiculous offer

1301
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:29,836
of twelve thousand dollars
that made me even consider it.

1302
01:46:29,852 --> 01:46:31,252
Hmm-hmm.

1303
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:43,311
You know Monsieur Candie, you do
possess the power of persuasion.

1304
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:52,137
Why not, Monsieur Candie, you have a
deal, Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!

1305
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:55,393
Hurray, doctor, hurray, and
a wise decision, that is!

1306
01:46:55,455 --> 01:46:58,866
However, that is a
tremendous amount of money.

1307
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,338
And the way you have your
Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer,

1308
01:47:02,387 --> 01:47:04,377
a persnickety man named Tuttle,

1309
01:47:04,517 --> 01:47:07,694
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1310
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:11,705
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1311
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:15,390
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe
examined by a physician of my choosing.

1312
01:47:15,444 --> 01:47:16,844
Naturally.

1313
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:21,097
So say I return in about...

1314
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:25,790
.. five days time.
- Five days?!

1315
01:47:25,969 --> 01:47:28,826
With my Mr. Tuttle.
And then my Mr. Tuttle

1316
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:32,340
and your Mr. Moguy can hash out the
finer details between themselves.

1317
01:47:33,474 --> 01:47:36,339
I say splendid Doctor... Splendid.

1318
01:47:37,152 --> 01:47:38,552
Gentlemen...

1319
01:47:39,464 --> 01:47:40,928
may I propose a toast...

1320
01:47:43,695 --> 01:47:47,468
to Eskimo Joe. Or, shall we call him

1321
01:47:47,778 --> 01:47:49,598
the Black Hercules.

1322
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:51,656
To the Black Hercules.

1323
01:47:51,774 --> 01:47:53,019
The Black Hercules!

1324
01:47:53,277 --> 01:47:54,779
The Black Hercules...

1325
01:47:54,844 --> 01:47:58,060
You was right, Doctor, that
name do help pay an ass.

1326
01:48:00,388 --> 01:48:01,788
Hildi...

1327
01:48:02,218 --> 01:48:03,456
I'm outta drink, girl.

1328
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:10,952
So Hildi... how you like servin' at
the big table in the big house, huh?

1329
01:48:11,957 --> 01:48:14,689
When Monsieur Candy
talk to you, you answers.

1330
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:17,121
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.

1331
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:18,145
Hmm-hmm.

1332
01:48:18,302 --> 01:48:20,216
It's a lot better than
sizzling in that hot box,

1333
01:48:20,235 --> 01:48:22,635
or draggin' your ass
through a bramble bush.

1334
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:25,722
Maybe it's not quite as much fun as
getting the pleasure o' the mandingos,

1335
01:48:25,753 --> 01:48:27,652
huh sugar babe?
- Hmm oh, she like them new.

1336
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:30,213
- Like Simpson, huh?
- Yessir.

1337
01:48:30,549 --> 01:48:32,210
- You know Monsieur Candie,
- Hmm?

1338
01:48:32,231 --> 01:48:35,924
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1339
01:48:35,948 --> 01:48:39,234
since how they don't have many
niggers where he come from.

1340
01:48:39,297 --> 01:48:42,036
Dr. Schultz, when you
was alone with Hildi here,

1341
01:48:42,059 --> 01:48:45,255
did ya just speak German, or
did ya git her clothes off?

1342
01:48:45,287 --> 01:48:47,087
No, we just talked and...

1343
01:48:47,138 --> 01:48:49,144
Oh so
- so you haven't seen her back?

1344
01:48:49,336 --> 01:48:50,324
I haven't-

1345
01:48:50,434 --> 01:48:53,529
No no no, now Steven's right,
you might find this interesting.

1346
01:48:53,589 --> 01:48:57,219
Hildi, com'on take off your dress,
show Dr. Schultz your back here, go on!

1347
01:48:57,258 --> 01:49:01,263
Uh, Calvin, I just got her all
dressed up and looking nice.

1348
01:49:01,365 --> 01:49:05,784
But... Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from
Dusseldorf, they don't got niggers there.

1349
01:49:05,993 --> 01:49:07,474
He's a man of medicine.

1350
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:10,537
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers endurance for pain.

1351
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:14,089
These niggers are tough Dr.
Schultz, no doubt about it.

1352
01:49:14,176 --> 01:49:16,595
Hilda's got somethin' like
four lashes on her back.

1353
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:19,054
Lare Lee, just get
- why don't you lose her goddamn mat?

1354
01:49:19,086 --> 01:49:21,091
Look a' that, doctor, it's
like a painting, look at that.

1355
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,190
Calvin!

1356
01:49:23,096 --> 01:49:26,181
We are eating, ain't no one
wanna look at her whipped up back!

1357
01:49:28,197 --> 01:49:30,241
Fine. Fine, fine fine fine...

1358
01:49:30,507 --> 01:49:32,981
After the dinner,
Steven. After dinner.

1359
01:49:34,216 --> 01:49:35,715
During the brandies, gentlemen. Uh?

1360
01:49:42,147 --> 01:49:44,247
Cora, come get this girl!

1361
01:49:47,196 --> 01:49:49,498
She all messed.
- Yes ma'am?

1362
01:49:49,951 --> 01:49:51,965
Oh! Why are you all undone?

1363
01:49:52,012 --> 01:49:54,676
I just got you done,
now come over, here!

1364
01:50:01,077 --> 01:50:04,981
Baby, you got Steven his bad side,
when you need to be on his blind side.

1365
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:07,168
You said you ain't know him?

1366
01:50:08,197 --> 01:50:09,332
Huh?

1367
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:14,451
I said... you said
you ain't know him.

1368
01:50:16,316 --> 01:50:17,876
I don't.

1369
01:50:18,236 --> 01:50:19,559
Yes you do.

1370
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,985
Mister Steven...

1371
01:50:24,393 --> 01:50:25,712
I don't.

1372
01:50:25,907 --> 01:50:27,707
Why is you lyin' to me?

1373
01:50:30,342 --> 01:50:31,678
I ain't.

1374
01:50:32,156 --> 01:50:34,116
Then why is you cry?

1375
01:50:35,017 --> 01:50:36,382
You scarin' me.

1376
01:50:36,622 --> 01:50:38,422
Why is I'm scarin' you?

1377
01:50:39,255 --> 01:50:40,955
Because you scary.

1378
01:50:42,689 --> 01:50:49,077
.. to speak German this afternoon with
Hildi, was positively soul enriching.

1379
01:50:52,139 --> 01:50:54,863
You stay in that chair.

1380
01:51:00,442 --> 01:51:05,041
You indicated earlier you'd
be willing to part with Hildi.

1381
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:07,953
Oh yes. Yesiree Bob I did.

1382
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:15,709
In that case... allow me...
to propose another proposition.

1383
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:16,956
I'm all ears.

1384
01:51:17,183 --> 01:51:19,003
Hurry up, goddammit!

1385
01:51:19,969 --> 01:51:21,972
Monsieur
Candie- - Steven!

1386
01:51:22,434 --> 01:51:24,873
You just interrupted
Dr. Schultz here!

1387
01:51:25,818 --> 01:51:30,948
Uhm... sorry doctor Schultz, my
ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1388
01:51:32,308 --> 01:51:35,587
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen.

1389
01:51:36,522 --> 01:51:38,480
You mean get up outta my chair?

1390
01:51:38,618 --> 01:51:40,410
If you could manage it.

1391
01:51:40,723 --> 01:51:41,843
Why?

1392
01:51:42,135 --> 01:51:43,664
It's about dessert.

1393
01:51:43,778 --> 01:51:45,398
What about dessert?

1394
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:48,559
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1395
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:50,695
We're havin' white cake.

1396
01:51:50,931 --> 01:51:53,436
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1397
01:51:53,585 --> 01:51:57,856
You right Monsieur Candy, you
right, I'll handle it myself.

1398
01:51:58,002 --> 01:51:59,426
Meet me in the library.

1399
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:03,073
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to the evening,

1400
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,983
she get fucked up 'round
here, you blame me.

1401
01:52:05,078 --> 01:52:06,896
Fine, fine friend Steven, I...

1402
01:52:08,107 --> 01:52:09,662
will be along momentarily.

1403
01:52:10,409 --> 01:52:11,529
Yessir.

1404
01:52:12,363 --> 01:52:13,483
Well...

1405
01:52:14,176 --> 01:52:15,134
gentlemen...

1406
01:52:15,373 --> 01:52:18,175
as you can see, talented as
they are no doubt in the kitchen,

1407
01:52:18,207 --> 01:52:21,962
from time to time... adult
supervision is required.

1408
01:52:24,869 --> 01:52:26,827
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1409
01:52:32,784 --> 01:52:34,884
You may clear the dinner service.

1410
01:52:38,915 --> 01:52:39,812
Hurry up girl.

1411
01:52:39,966 --> 01:52:41,374
So Dr. Schultz...

1412
01:52:41,804 --> 01:52:44,622
Why don't you regal us
with the tale of the circus?

1413
01:52:45,418 --> 01:52:47,035
The circus!

1414
01:52:54,295 --> 01:52:56,095
What is the matter?

1415
01:53:01,404 --> 01:53:05,956
Them motherfuckers ain't
here to buy no mandingos.

1416
01:53:06,602 --> 01:53:08,058
They wants that girl.

1417
01:53:10,313 --> 01:53:13,053
Steven, what the hell
are you talkin' about, hm?

1418
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:16,477
They playin' your ass for a
fool, that what I'm talkin' bout.

1419
01:53:16,758 --> 01:53:20,123
They ain't here for
no muscle bound jimmie,

1420
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,271
they here for that girl.

1421
01:53:22,717 --> 01:53:25,278
What... what girl. What... Hildi?

1422
01:53:25,308 --> 01:53:27,587
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?

1423
01:53:27,908 --> 01:53:30,016
Them niggers know each other.

1424
01:53:31,001 --> 01:53:32,717
He... he just bought Eskimo Joe.

1425
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:34,053
Did he give you any money?

1426
01:53:34,115 --> 01:53:35,209
No, not yet, but they go-

1427
01:53:35,229 --> 01:53:37,722
Then he didn't buy
diddly, not yet no how.

1428
01:53:37,912 --> 01:53:43,152
But he's just about to buy who he come
here to buy, when I interrupted him.

1429
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:46,337
Thank you Steven.
You're welcome Calvin.

1430
01:53:51,966 --> 01:53:54,213
Whe
- where you gettin' all this?

1431
01:53:55,002 --> 01:53:57,489
Why would they go through all
that trouble for a nigger with a-

1432
01:53:57,496 --> 01:53:59,913
with a chewed up back, ain't
worth three hundred dollars?

1433
01:54:00,095 --> 01:54:03,733
They're doin' it cause that
nigger Django's in love with Hildi.

1434
01:54:04,265 --> 01:54:05,934
She probably his wife.

1435
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:10,060
Now, why that German give a fuck who that
uppity son-of-a-bitch is in love with,

1436
01:54:10,074 --> 01:54:12,274
I'm sure I don't know.

1437
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:16,915
If she's who they want...

1438
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:21,474
why this whole... snake oil
pitch about mandingos in?

1439
01:54:21,836 --> 01:54:24,818
You wouldn't pay no never
mind into three hundred dollar.

1440
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,149
But that twelve thousand?

1441
01:54:28,457 --> 01:54:30,644
That made you real
friendly now, didn'it?

1442
01:54:33,639 --> 01:54:35,039
Yes it did.

1443
01:54:38,746 --> 01:54:39,879
His wife, uh?

1444
01:54:44,652 --> 01:54:46,509
If it had been a snake...

1445
01:54:46,883 --> 01:54:48,290
we would have beat'em.

1446
01:54:51,424 --> 01:54:56,289
Those lyin'... goddamn time...

1447
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,979
wastin' sonsabitches.

1448
01:55:02,224 --> 01:55:03,784
Sonsabitches!

1449
01:55:03,917 --> 01:55:08,859
.. out of New Orleans, so I had quite
a bit of practice with... theaters types.

1450
01:55:10,095 --> 01:55:11,745
Oh there you are!

1451
01:55:11,845 --> 01:55:15,420
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow ran off together.

1452
01:55:16,724 --> 01:55:18,831
That'd be a hell of
a note, wouldn't it?

1453
01:55:19,099 --> 01:55:20,112
Lara Lee...

1454
01:55:20,354 --> 01:55:21,971
I was just lookin'
out the big window.

1455
01:55:22,045 --> 01:55:23,937
Billy Crash is out
there dealin' with some

1456
01:55:23,972 --> 01:55:26,368
shady slaver try n'
sellin' a passel of ponys,

1457
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:29,617
would you be a dear and go out
there give them gals an eyeball.

1458
01:55:30,501 --> 01:55:33,301
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1459
01:55:45,947 --> 01:55:49,360
Okay. Business never sleeps.

1460
01:55:51,654 --> 01:55:53,054
A propos...

1461
01:55:53,202 --> 01:55:58,932
before your exit, we were discussing the
possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1462
01:55:59,027 --> 01:56:01,309
Ah yes! Yes we would.

1463
01:56:02,028 --> 01:56:04,387
And we will again... in a moment.

1464
01:56:20,488 --> 01:56:22,588
Who is your little friend?

1465
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:29,150
This is Ben...

1466
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,248
He's a Ol'Joe that... lived
around here for a long time.

1467
01:56:35,811 --> 01:56:37,911
And I do mean a long damn time.

1468
01:56:39,303 --> 01:56:40,703
Well Ben here...

1469
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:43,170
took care of my daddy...

1470
01:56:43,733 --> 01:56:45,553
and my daddy's daddy...

1471
01:56:46,129 --> 01:56:48,275
till the open kill doe who one day...

1472
01:56:51,377 --> 01:56:52,859
who been took care o'me.

1473
01:56:55,633 --> 01:56:59,537
Growin'up the son of a... of a
huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1474
01:56:59,551 --> 01:57:05,541
puts a white men in contact with
a whole lot o'... black faces.

1475
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:12,336
I spent my whole life here...
right here... in Candyland...

1476
01:57:13,704 --> 01:57:17,233
surrounded... by black faces.

1477
01:57:19,546 --> 01:57:22,614
And seein' them ev'ry
day, day in day out, I...

1478
01:57:23,216 --> 01:57:24,918
I only had one question.

1479
01:57:28,987 --> 01:57:30,620
Why don't they kill us?

1480
01:57:34,727 --> 01:57:36,654
Now right up there on that porch...

1481
01:57:37,077 --> 01:57:39,568
three times a week for fifty years,

1482
01:57:39,702 --> 01:57:44,262
Ol'Ben here... would shave my
Daddy with a straight razor.

1483
01:57:45,004 --> 01:57:50,126
Now... if I was Ol'Ben, I would
have cut my Daddy's goddamn throat,

1484
01:57:50,185 --> 01:57:53,925
and it wouldn't have taken me
no fifty years to do it neither.

1485
01:57:56,276 --> 01:57:57,688
But he never did.

1486
01:57:59,532 --> 01:58:00,652
Why not?

1487
01:58:02,186 --> 01:58:03,061
You see...

1488
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:05,818
the science of analogy...

1489
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:12,071
is crucial to understandin' the...
separation about two species.

1490
01:58:13,873 --> 01:58:16,277
In the skull of the African here...

1491
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:20,228
the area associated
with submissiveness

1492
01:58:20,296 --> 01:58:25,559
is larger than any human or any other
sup human species on planet earth.

1493
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:43,310
If you examine...

1494
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,690
this peace of skull here...

1495
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:56,982
you'll notice three distinct dimples.

1496
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,574
Here... here... and here.

1497
01:59:04,019 --> 01:59:05,139
Now...

1498
01:59:05,449 --> 01:59:10,212
If I was holding a skull of a
- of a... of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1499
01:59:10,611 --> 01:59:14,882
these three dimples would be found in the
area o'the skull most associated with...

1500
01:59:15,226 --> 01:59:16,626
creativity.

1501
01:59:17,224 --> 01:59:19,324
Î’ut thÑ–Ñ•' thÐµ
Ñ•kull Ð¾f ÎŸl'Î’Ðµn.

1502
01:59:20,036 --> 01:59:23,916
And in the skull of
Ol'Ben, unburden by genes,

1503
01:59:24,513 --> 01:59:28,721
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1504
01:59:29,675 --> 01:59:31,075
servility.

1505
01:59:32,394 --> 01:59:33,899
Now Bright Boy...

1506
01:59:34,767 --> 01:59:37,007
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1507
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,342
But if I took this hammer here...

1508
01:59:43,753 --> 01:59:45,750
and I bashed it in your skull...

1509
01:59:47,062 --> 01:59:49,445
you would have the
same three dimples...

1510
01:59:50,172 --> 01:59:51,966
in the same place...

1511
01:59:53,794 --> 01:59:55,161
as Ol'Ben.

1512
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:59,910
Now lay your palms
flat on the table top!

1513
02:00:00,008 --> 02:00:03,051
If you lift those palms off
that turtle shell table top,

1514
02:00:03,104 --> 02:00:06,349
Mr. Butch is gonna let loose with
both barrels of that sawed off!

1515
02:00:07,454 --> 02:00:10,796
There have been a latta lies said
around this diner table here tonight,

1516
02:00:10,822 --> 02:00:12,446
but that you can believe!

1517
02:00:13,647 --> 02:00:14,754
Mr. Moguy,

1518
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,618
would you be so kind as to collect the
pistol hangin' on those boys hips here?

1519
02:00:23,452 --> 02:00:24,832
Thank you ever so much.

1520
02:00:24,903 --> 02:00:26,023
Doctor.

1521
02:00:30,402 --> 02:00:31,681
Where were we?

1522
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:37,459
Jackass.

1523
02:00:41,365 --> 02:00:42,804
Oh yes...

1524
02:00:43,314 --> 02:00:48,077
I do believe you were just getting ready
to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1525
02:00:48,751 --> 02:00:50,029
I am right?

1526
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,120
Right then.

1527
02:00:57,822 --> 02:00:59,321
Bring out Hildi!

1528
02:01:02,509 --> 02:01:03,629
Your way, honey.

1529
02:01:05,217 --> 02:01:07,417
Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!

1530
02:01:07,441 --> 02:01:08,886
Lay your hands flat on that table.

1531
02:01:08,941 --> 02:01:10,761
And shut your mouth!

1532
02:01:14,597 --> 02:01:18,986
Dr. Schultz... in
Greenville, you yourself said,

1533
02:01:19,090 --> 02:01:21,251
that for the ""Right Nigger""
you'd be willing to pay

1534
02:01:21,267 --> 02:01:24,400
what some may consider
is a ridiculous amount.

1535
02:01:25,079 --> 02:01:28,053
To which, me myself said, ""What is
your definition of ridiculous? "",

1536
02:01:28,081 --> 02:01:31,920
to which you said,
""Twelve thousand dollars"".

1537
02:01:32,989 --> 02:01:36,799
Now considering you all have
ridden a whole lotta miles,

1538
02:01:36,961 --> 02:01:38,641
went to a whole lotta trouble,

1539
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:43,484
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase this lovely lady right here,

1540
02:01:43,516 --> 02:01:48,810
it would appear that Broomhilda
is in fact the ""Right Nigger""!

1541
02:01:50,063 --> 02:01:52,740
And if y'all wanna leave
Candyland with Broomhilda...

1542
02:01:53,829 --> 02:01:59,146
the price is twelve thousand dollars.

1543
02:01:59,539 --> 02:02:03,693
And I take it you prefer the ""take
it or leave it"" style of negotiating?

1544
02:02:05,615 --> 02:02:07,435
Yes I do, doctor.

1545
02:02:07,976 --> 02:02:14,106
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw
County, Broomhilda here is my property.

1546
02:02:14,653 --> 02:02:19,869
And I can chose to do with my
property whatever I so desire!

1547
02:02:21,064 --> 02:02:27,608
And if you all think my price
for this nigger here is too steep,

1548
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:30,427
what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1549
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:37,571
take this fuckin' hammer here,
and beat her ass to death with it!

1550
02:02:37,651 --> 02:02:39,187
Right in front of both y'all!

1551
02:02:39,201 --> 02:02:40,060
Ain't it good, fella?

1552
02:02:40,063 --> 02:02:44,451
Then we can examine the three
dimples inside Broomhilda skull!

1553
02:02:44,647 --> 02:02:45,910
Now!

1554
02:02:46,043 --> 02:02:48,332
What's it gonna be, Doc? Huh?

1555
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:50,169
What's it gonna be?

1556
02:02:50,184 --> 02:02:53,784
May I lift the hands off the table
top in order to remove my billfold?

1557
02:02:55,597 --> 02:02:56,719
Yes you may.

1558
02:03:10,578 --> 02:03:11,698
That twelve.

1559
02:03:15,826 --> 02:03:17,245
Sold!

1560
02:03:17,957 --> 02:03:23,618
To the man with the exceptional
beard, and his unexceptional nigger.

1561
02:03:29,701 --> 02:03:31,724
Mr. Moguy.
- Yes Calvin?

1562
02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:36,071
You make this gentleman a receipt
for twelve thousand dollar, please.

1563
02:03:36,236 --> 02:03:39,054
- Twelve thousand dollar.
- Hm.

1564
02:03:41,074 --> 02:03:43,474
It was a pleasure doin'
business with ya all.

1565
02:03:44,046 --> 02:03:45,482
Now gentlemen...

1566
02:03:46,834 --> 02:03:48,927
If you care to join
me in the parlor...

1567
02:03:49,771 --> 02:03:52,074
we will be serving white cake.

1568
02:05:20,445 --> 02:05:21,997
Well done, Calvin.

1569
02:05:24,815 --> 02:05:27,633
Excuse me... Excuse me, madam?

1570
02:05:28,821 --> 02:05:31,225
Could you please stop
playing Beethoven?

1571
02:05:31,269 --> 02:05:32,607
Take your hands off that harp!

1572
02:05:36,993 --> 02:05:38,113
Doctor!

1573
02:05:38,389 --> 02:05:40,988
- Doc, you can't go in there!
- Hey uh, Steven, hey!

1574
02:05:40,998 --> 02:05:43,011
- He got no business goin' in there.
- Let it be.

1575
02:05:43,806 --> 02:05:47,186
He's a little upset, that's
all. I'll handle this.

1576
02:06:12,941 --> 02:06:14,061
White cake?

1577
02:06:15,204 --> 02:06:18,004
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1578
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:29,996
You brooding 'bout me
getting the best of ya, uh?

1579
02:06:30,911 --> 02:06:35,432
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1580
02:06:35,674 --> 02:06:37,026
D'Artagnan.

1581
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:41,427
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1582
02:06:42,251 --> 02:06:44,051
Come again?

1583
02:06:46,936 --> 02:06:50,785
Alexandre Dumas. He wrote
""The Three Musketeers"".

1584
02:06:51,207 --> 02:06:52,918
Yes of course, doctor.

1585
02:06:52,957 --> 02:06:54,703
I figured you must be an admirer,

1586
02:06:54,713 --> 02:06:58,486
you named your slave after
his novel's lead character.

1587
02:06:59,441 --> 02:07:03,059
Now if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1588
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:05,350
I wonder what he
would have made of it?

1589
02:07:07,344 --> 02:07:08,990
You doubt he'd approve?

1590
02:07:11,151 --> 02:07:16,180
Yes, his approval would be a
dubious proposition at best.

1591
02:07:18,574 --> 02:07:20,347
Soft hearted Frenchy?

1592
02:07:22,377 --> 02:07:24,377
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1593
02:07:28,469 --> 02:07:30,304
Are these Broomhilda's papers?

1594
02:07:30,414 --> 02:07:32,232
- Yes they are.
- May I?

1595
02:07:32,365 --> 02:07:34,159
- Of course!
- Thank you.

1596
02:07:36,863 --> 02:07:42,071
I dealt her bill of sale of ownership is
written of course a freedom papers, doctor.

1597
02:07:42,291 --> 02:07:44,452
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1598
02:07:45,653 --> 02:07:47,523
Right over there,
on that little table.

1599
02:07:47,617 --> 02:07:49,017
Thank you.

1600
02:08:09,888 --> 02:08:11,288
Thank you.

1601
02:08:14,773 --> 02:08:16,593
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1602
02:08:19,084 --> 02:08:21,302
consider yourself a free woman.

1603
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,320
Mister Candy...

1604
02:08:37,248 --> 02:08:40,753
Normally, I would
say ""auf wiedersehen"".

1605
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:45,673
But since what ""auf wiedersehen""
actually means is ""till I see you again"",

1606
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:49,703
and since I never wish to
see you again, to you sir,

1607
02:08:50,133 --> 02:08:52,735
I say good bye.

1608
02:08:56,983 --> 02:08:58,383
Let's go.

1609
02:08:59,723 --> 02:09:00,843
Com'on.

1610
02:09:02,858 --> 02:09:05,258
One more moment, Doctor!

1611
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:07,726
What?

1612
02:09:12,293 --> 02:09:14,470
It's a custom here in the South,

1613
02:09:14,996 --> 02:09:18,165
once a business deal is
concluded that the two parties...

1614
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:20,541
shake hands.

1615
02:09:21,277 --> 02:09:22,664
It implies good faith.

1616
02:09:23,474 --> 02:09:25,593
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1617
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:28,125
in my house doctor...

1618
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:31,316
so I'm afraid I must insist.

1619
02:09:31,589 --> 02:09:35,088
Insist? On what? That
I shake your hand?

1620
02:09:35,105 --> 02:09:38,235
Oh, then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite direction.

1621
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:40,453
You know what I think you are?

1622
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:43,640
What you think I am? No I don't.

1623
02:09:45,490 --> 02:09:47,657
I think you are a bad loser.

1624
02:09:47,831 --> 02:09:50,831
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1625
02:09:51,026 --> 02:09:52,539
Never the less...

1626
02:09:52,886 --> 02:09:55,781
here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1627
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:58,734
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1628
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:02,419
Even after all that paper
signin', don't mean shit...

1629
02:10:03,341 --> 02:10:06,385
you don't shake my hand.

1630
02:10:07,729 --> 02:10:10,664
If I don't shake your hand,

1631
02:10:10,859 --> 02:10:13,507
you're gonna throw away
twelve thousand dollars?

1632
02:10:13,688 --> 02:10:15,787
I don't think so.

1633
02:10:16,609 --> 02:10:18,289
Mr. Butch,

1634
02:10:19,657 --> 02:10:23,662
if she tries to leave here before this
nigger lovin' German shakes my hand,

1635
02:10:24,432 --> 02:10:26,592
you cut her ass down.

1636
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:51,424
You really want me
to shake your hand?

1637
02:10:52,951 --> 02:10:54,511
I insist.

1638
02:10:55,972 --> 02:10:58,222
If you insist.

1639
02:11:16,453 --> 02:11:18,212
Aaah Calvin!

1640
02:11:19,108 --> 02:11:21,206
Caalvin!

1641
02:11:26,976 --> 02:11:29,432
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1642
02:11:42,143 --> 02:11:44,078
The nigger's going crazy, the hell-

1643
02:11:44,727 --> 02:11:47,396
Help, he's blowing everybody
- Aaah!

1644
02:12:04,453 --> 02:12:06,575
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1645
02:12:10,728 --> 02:12:11,848
Get that fuckin'...

1646
02:12:12,476 --> 02:12:13,596
Get that fuckin'-

1647
02:12:16,567 --> 02:12:21,182
Damn sonofabitch, what- what
did the fuckin'- goddammit!

1648
02:12:22,846 --> 02:12:23,966
What the-

1649
02:12:25,672 --> 02:12:27,039
Don't strike me!

1650
02:12:27,132 --> 02:12:28,857
You stupid sonofabitch!

1651
02:12:28,928 --> 02:12:30,328
Sorry Jessie!

1652
02:12:30,404 --> 02:12:34,995
Who the fuck gave a
nigger a goddamn gun!

1653
02:13:08,190 --> 02:13:10,515
Nigger, com'on and kill-

1654
02:13:10,922 --> 02:13:14,169
Aah! God! Ah my God, aah!

1655
02:13:14,289 --> 02:13:16,138
Motherfucker!

1656
02:14:35,634 --> 02:14:37,454
Hold your fire!

1657
02:14:40,294 --> 02:14:42,114
Hold your fire!

1658
02:14:43,597 --> 02:14:45,697
Stop shooting, goddammit!

1659
02:14:54,284 --> 02:14:55,404
Django!

1660
02:14:56,285 --> 02:14:57,405
What?

1661
02:15:00,267 --> 02:15:02,087
We got your woman!

1662
02:15:03,273 --> 02:15:06,342
Billy Crash here ha' got
his pistol upside her hair!

1663
02:15:06,841 --> 02:15:08,880
You'll stop all that gettin'on,

1664
02:15:08,982 --> 02:15:11,518
he don't blow her goddamn brains out.

1665
02:15:11,693 --> 02:15:13,582
And that ain't no third holes, boy!

1666
02:15:14,535 --> 02:15:15,907
That there is a promise.

1667
02:15:17,509 --> 02:15:18,629
Oh oh!

1668
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:20,090
You ain't give up?

1669
02:15:20,546 --> 02:15:22,646
Thought you going, uh?

1670
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,080
We will kill you!

1671
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:25,850
How shit?!

1672
02:15:26,052 --> 02:15:28,776
Honest, ain't lyin',
Django, I swear o' all God.

1673
02:15:30,177 --> 02:15:31,297
You give up?

1674
02:15:32,151 --> 02:15:34,422
Ain't no harm gonna come t'you.

1675
02:15:36,306 --> 02:15:38,352
And I'm supposed to
believe your black ass?

1676
02:15:38,728 --> 02:15:41,858
Personal, I ain't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1677
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:44,965
I believe, if you don't give
up in the next ten seconds,

1678
02:15:44,979 --> 02:15:47,140
we gonna blow this bitch
her brains out! Believe that!

1679
02:15:47,159 --> 02:15:48,968
Believe that!

1680
02:15:53,184 --> 02:15:54,582
You give me up.

1681
02:15:54,824 --> 02:15:55,527
Six!

1682
02:15:55,551 --> 02:15:56,871
Just let me go!

1683
02:15:57,021 --> 02:15:57,769
Seven!

1684
02:15:57,797 --> 02:15:59,271
- I take care too much.
- Django.

1685
02:15:59,341 --> 02:16:00,195
Eight!

1686
02:16:00,524 --> 02:16:01,924
I love you.

1687
02:16:01,993 --> 02:16:03,113
Nine!

1688
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:04,888
- Hold it!
- No!

1689
02:16:07,279 --> 02:16:08,607
I give up.

1690
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:11,562
I can't hear you, nigger.

1691
02:16:12,469 --> 02:16:14,547
I said: I give up!

1692
02:18:14,968 --> 02:18:16,793
Hock a litl'e doodle, nigger.

1693
02:18:22,496 --> 02:18:24,775
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1694
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,840
I knew there was something
fishy 'bout y'all.

1695
02:18:29,356 --> 02:18:34,025
We found your ""wanted"" posters... and
book of figures in your saddle bags.

1696
02:18:35,762 --> 02:18:37,307
I gotta say...

1697
02:18:38,115 --> 02:18:40,706
I ain't never heard of no
black bounty hunter before.

1698
02:18:41,432 --> 02:18:44,742
A black boy paid to kill white men,
how d'you like that line of work?

1699
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:48,370
Prob'bly pretty good
while it lasted, uh?

1700
02:18:57,983 --> 02:19:00,099
Time to say goodnight
to them nuts, black.

1701
02:19:00,282 --> 02:19:01,365
On three...

1702
02:19:02,149 --> 02:19:03,248
One...

1703
02:19:03,788 --> 02:19:04,756
I got you.

1704
02:19:05,506 --> 02:19:06,692
Two...

1705
02:19:06,973 --> 02:19:08,892
Calm down nigger, keep calm.

1706
02:19:10,033 --> 02:19:11,153
Cap't?

1707
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:13,160
Miss Lara wants to see you.

1708
02:19:14,265 --> 02:19:17,073
That is somethin' to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1709
02:19:18,455 --> 02:19:21,922
Oh, and she changed her
mind 'bout snippin' Django.

1710
02:19:23,079 --> 02:19:26,381
She gonna give 'em to
the LeQuint Dickey people.

1711
02:19:27,671 --> 02:19:30,231
Well she didn't waste
a minute tellin' me.

1712
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:39,197
How disappointing.

1713
02:20:01,815 --> 02:20:02,935
You n' me.

1714
02:20:04,907 --> 02:20:06,027
These ain't...

1715
02:20:06,453 --> 02:20:08,273
what you take with you.

1716
02:20:11,333 --> 02:20:14,854
Your black ass been all the
motherfuckers' in that Big House

1717
02:20:14,909 --> 02:20:17,539
could talk about for
the last few hours.

1718
02:20:18,446 --> 02:20:22,342
Seemed like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in their life,

1719
02:20:22,363 --> 02:20:24,803
was comin' up with all kinds
o'ways to kill your ass.

1720
02:20:25,014 --> 02:20:30,621
Now mind ya, most of 'dem ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1721
02:20:30,697 --> 02:20:35,999
Now, that may seem like a
good idea, but truth is...

1722
02:20:37,669 --> 02:20:43,338
when you snip a nigger's nuts,
most of 'em bleed out, know 'bout...

1723
02:20:43,612 --> 02:20:45,612
seven minutes, most of 'em...

1724
02:20:47,992 --> 02:20:49,419
More than most.

1725
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:51,739
Then I say is...

1726
02:20:53,504 --> 02:20:55,340
Hells bells...

1727
02:20:56,180 --> 02:21:00,174
the niggers we sell to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that.

1728
02:21:01,244 --> 02:21:04,069
And they're still sayin'
""Let's whip 'em to death"",

1729
02:21:04,145 --> 02:21:07,595
""Dump 'em to the mandingos"",
""Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs"".

1730
02:21:07,831 --> 02:21:12,891
And I say, ""What's so special 'bout
that? We do that shit all the time!

1731
02:21:13,048 --> 02:21:19,295
Hells bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that"".

1732
02:21:20,410 --> 02:21:27,136
Low and behold, out of nowhere, miss
Lara come up with the bright idea

1733
02:21:28,078 --> 02:21:32,739
of givin' your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1734
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:38,519
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1735
02:21:39,254 --> 02:21:42,783
hence forth, till the day you die,

1736
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,986
all day, ev'ryday,

1737
02:21:46,236 --> 02:21:48,843
you will be swingin' a sledgehammer,

1738
02:21:49,192 --> 02:21:53,272
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1739
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:58,680
Now when you get there, they
gonna take away your name,

1740
02:21:58,844 --> 02:22:01,599
give you a number,
and a sledgehammer,

1741
02:22:02,021 --> 02:22:03,857
and say ""get to work"".

1742
02:22:04,662 --> 02:22:07,112
One word of says, they
cuts out your tongue,

1743
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:09,513
they's good at that too,
you won't believe that.

1744
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:12,043
Ooh, they does that for you.

1745
02:22:13,502 --> 02:22:19,845
They gonna work you, all day,
ev'ry day, till your back give up.

1746
02:22:20,407 --> 02:22:22,896
Then they gonna hit you in
the head with the hammer,

1747
02:22:23,039 --> 02:22:25,388
tow your ass down the nigger hole.

1748
02:22:25,881 --> 02:22:31,175
And that... will be the
story end for you, Django.

1749
02:23:19,896 --> 02:23:21,716
Hey, white boy...

1750
02:23:22,982 --> 02:23:24,802
I said: hey, white boy!

1751
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,906
Shut up, black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

1752
02:23:27,938 --> 02:23:30,647
How'd you like to make
eleven thousand dollars?

1753
02:23:30,694 --> 02:23:31,980
D'you ain't hear?

1754
02:23:32,018 --> 02:23:34,766
I said, how d'you like to
make eleven thousand dollars?

1755
02:23:35,722 --> 02:23:37,821
Eleven thousand five
hundred, actually.

1756
02:23:38,267 --> 02:23:40,235
What the fuck are you talking about?

1757
02:23:40,306 --> 02:23:42,522
Back there at that
plantation Candyland,

1758
02:23:42,676 --> 02:23:45,126
there was an eleven thousand
five hundred dollar fortune,

1759
02:23:45,148 --> 02:23:47,868
just sittin' there, and
y'all rode right past it.

1760
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:50,437
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1761
02:23:50,566 --> 02:23:53,446
I ain't sayin' that, nice
thing 'bout this fortune it is.

1762
02:23:53,661 --> 02:23:56,104
It ain't illegal, you can't steal it,

1763
02:23:57,003 --> 02:23:58,430
ya gotta earn it, white boy.

1764
02:23:59,133 --> 02:24:01,305
You got something to
say, mate, you say it.

1765
02:24:01,457 --> 02:24:04,738
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune waiting for you back at Candyland,

1766
02:24:04,786 --> 02:24:07,236
is in the form of a
wanted dead or alive bounty

1767
02:24:07,253 --> 02:24:09,352
on Smitty Bacall,
and the Bacall Gang.

1768
02:24:09,493 --> 02:24:11,352
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1769
02:24:11,393 --> 02:24:14,609
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murdering gang of stagecoach robbers,

1770
02:24:14,784 --> 02:24:16,415
the Bacall Gang.

1771
02:24:16,526 --> 02:24:19,533
There's a seven thousand dollar
wanted dead or alive bounty on him,

1772
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:23,071
one thousand five hundred dollars
for each of his three accomplices.

1773
02:24:23,274 --> 02:24:24,461
Dandy Michaels,

1774
02:24:25,227 --> 02:24:26,347
Gerald Nash,

1775
02:24:26,618 --> 02:24:28,858
Crazy Craig Koons.

1776
02:24:29,686 --> 02:24:32,465
Now all four o'them gentlemen,
they're back there at Candyland,

1777
02:24:32,535 --> 02:24:34,650
laughin' their ass off. You know why?

1778
02:24:34,876 --> 02:24:37,076
Cause they just got away with murder.

1779
02:24:37,342 --> 02:24:39,011
But it ain't got to be that way.

1780
02:24:39,085 --> 02:24:42,504
You and your mate, young
rabbit and Yango get that money.

1781
02:24:42,559 --> 02:24:43,856
What these jokers do again?

1782
02:24:43,903 --> 02:24:46,721
These sonofabitch, they
- they killed innocent people.

1783
02:24:47,362 --> 02:24:49,906
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people!

1784
02:24:51,836 --> 02:24:54,719
I got the handbill right here in
my pocket if you let me get it.

1785
02:24:54,767 --> 02:24:56,167
Get it here.

1786
02:24:58,015 --> 02:25:03,255
Wanted dead or alive... Smitty
Bacall and the Smitty Bacall gang.

1787
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:04,853
But you're a slave!

1788
02:25:05,143 --> 02:25:06,963
I ain't no goddamn slave!

1789
02:25:07,533 --> 02:25:08,921
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1790
02:25:08,976 --> 02:25:11,458
- 7000 dollars for Smitty
Bacall... - This is a shit load!

1791
02:25:11,638 --> 02:25:13,169
I'm a bounty hunter.

1792
02:25:14,837 --> 02:25:19,293
Yesterday, as a free man,
I rode in the Candyland,

1793
02:25:19,327 --> 02:25:23,549
on a horse, with my German
white partner, Dr. King Schultz.

1794
02:25:24,222 --> 02:25:28,727
We tracked the Bacall gang all the
way from Texas, to Chikasaw County.

1795
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:31,742
We finally found their ass
laying low at Candyland.

1796
02:25:32,102 --> 02:25:35,271
We went in there to get
'em, things went sour,

1797
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:38,732
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot.

1798
02:25:39,207 --> 02:25:43,157
Then ev'rybody there decided
to blame me, so here I am.

1799
02:25:45,447 --> 02:25:47,390
But Django ain't on that manifest,

1800
02:25:47,539 --> 02:25:50,200
and all o'you know I ain't
supposed to be on this trip.

1801
02:25:50,616 --> 02:25:53,566
But them four men are still
back there, they're still wanted,

1802
02:25:54,062 --> 02:25:56,236
and that eleven thousand
five hundred is up for grabs,

1803
02:25:56,245 --> 02:25:59,202
and the last thing they'd expect
is y'all ridin' back and gittin' it.

1804
02:25:59,713 --> 02:26:01,533
What's the deal?

1805
02:26:02,055 --> 02:26:05,974
You tell us who they are
and we... turn you lose?

1806
02:26:06,272 --> 02:26:08,372
I ain't tellin' who they are.

1807
02:26:08,504 --> 02:26:11,738
Look, you give me a
pistol, one o'them horses,

1808
02:26:11,993 --> 02:26:14,957
and five hundred dollars of that
eleven thousand five hundred,

1809
02:26:15,242 --> 02:26:16,652
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1810
02:26:16,838 --> 02:26:18,173
This a real handbill.

1811
02:26:18,567 --> 02:26:22,126
Ah jus'cause it's a real handbill's
doesn't mean that other bunch o'malarky is.

1812
02:26:22,226 --> 02:26:28,239
Now why would a slave have a wanted
dead or alive handbill in his pocket?

1813
02:26:32,846 --> 02:26:36,046
Ain't that black ridin'
into Candyland yesterday?

1814
02:26:42,014 --> 02:26:43,097
Alright...

1815
02:26:43,853 --> 02:26:45,878
I'm gonna ask you again...

1816
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:49,613
I want you to remember
I don't like liars.

1817
02:26:50,534 --> 02:26:55,930
Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride
in with a white man on horse yesterday?

1818
02:26:56,415 --> 02:26:57,535
Yeah.

1819
02:26:58,531 --> 02:27:00,656
They walked us from the
Greenville Auction and

1820
02:27:00,657 --> 02:27:02,731
he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1821
02:27:03,659 --> 02:27:05,836
And this white man...

1822
02:27:06,039 --> 02:27:07,667
was the black his slave?

1823
02:27:08,081 --> 02:27:09,635
He weren't no slave.

1824
02:27:09,782 --> 02:27:11,675
You
- you fuckin' sure about that?

1825
02:27:11,821 --> 02:27:13,221
Damn sure.

1826
02:27:17,504 --> 02:27:19,291
What happened over at Candyland?

1827
02:27:19,354 --> 02:27:20,408
Bunch of shootin'...

1828
02:27:21,033 --> 02:27:22,338
master got shot.

1829
02:27:23,018 --> 02:27:24,674
- Who shot 'em?
- The German.

1830
02:27:25,164 --> 02:27:26,375
Why did he do that?

1831
02:27:26,911 --> 02:27:30,403
The nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers, but they weren't.

1832
02:27:30,724 --> 02:27:32,409
Well, what were they?

1833
02:27:32,586 --> 02:27:34,284
Bounty hunters.

1834
02:27:35,098 --> 02:27:37,758
Fuck me Roy, I mean this
- this could be big, mate!

1835
02:27:39,174 --> 02:27:40,499
Well, smoke...

1836
02:27:41,281 --> 02:27:42,679
you gotta deal.

1837
02:27:43,941 --> 02:27:45,374
I got one more condition.

1838
02:27:45,986 --> 02:27:46,923
What is that?

1839
02:27:47,007 --> 02:27:49,864
When we get there...
when the time come...

1840
02:27:52,184 --> 02:27:54,041
you let me help you kill 'em.

1841
02:27:55,331 --> 02:27:56,977
You're a funny bugger!

1842
02:27:57,216 --> 02:27:58,992
- Get him loose.
- Yeah, yeah.

1843
02:27:59,461 --> 02:28:01,482
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1844
02:28:01,607 --> 02:28:03,263
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1845
02:28:05,577 --> 02:28:07,887
- You alright for a black fella!
- Oh yeah!

1846
02:28:09,934 --> 02:28:11,054
Jeez...

1847
02:28:13,774 --> 02:28:16,224
There ya go... There ya go, mate.

1848
02:28:17,267 --> 02:28:19,667
For you, we'll give you
that pack horse over here.

1849
02:28:19,923 --> 02:28:21,860
What's them saddle bags got in?

1850
02:28:22,131 --> 02:28:23,235
Dynamite.

1851
02:28:23,262 --> 02:28:26,142
I ain't ridin' no horse with
no goddamn dynamite on his back.

1852
02:28:26,247 --> 02:28:27,471
I can understand that.

1853
02:28:28,284 --> 02:28:33,867
Frankie, we take 'em sticks off that
horse, and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1854
02:28:35,118 --> 02:28:38,256
A little dynamite for you
black ass to play with!

1855
02:28:48,644 --> 02:28:51,393
Hey Floyd, you got that
rifle on the wagon, don't you?

1856
02:28:51,424 --> 02:28:52,338
Yeah, alright.

1857
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:54,510
Don't you give 'em
your gun and gun belt.

1858
02:28:56,789 --> 02:28:59,325
Now, don't drop the
fucking thing, alright?

1859
02:28:59,873 --> 02:29:02,677
I just had the sights
fixed, and that perfect.

1860
02:29:02,964 --> 02:29:04,558
Uh, that's good to know.

1861
02:30:36,672 --> 02:30:38,648
Throw me up that dynamite.

1862
02:32:08,842 --> 02:32:10,533
- Jake!
- Yeah?

1863
02:32:10,558 --> 02:32:14,126
You gotta try to see what's
goin'on with that goddamn dog!

1864
02:32:18,581 --> 02:32:20,438
Go to hell, you motherfucker!

1865
02:33:50,262 --> 02:33:51,916
Love you too, son.

1866
02:34:52,137 --> 02:34:53,537
It's me, baby.

1867
02:35:41,842 --> 02:35:44,741
#In the sweet...

1868
02:35:45,254 --> 02:35:49,173
#byin' bye...

1869
02:35:50,464 --> 02:35:52,542
#we will leave...

1870
02:35:53,331 --> 02:35:58,030
#on that beautiful song.

1871
02:36:03,896 --> 02:36:08,136
#Byin' bye... bye bye...

1872
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:12,610
#we will leave... we
will leave byin' bye.

1873
02:36:12,626 --> 02:36:13,473
Cora,

1874
02:36:13,558 --> 02:36:15,758
would you prepare us some coffee?

1875
02:36:15,921 --> 02:36:17,715
Sheba, you help her.

1876
02:36:17,781 --> 02:36:18,880
Come on.

1877
02:36:21,278 --> 02:36:24,078
#In the sweet...

1878
02:36:24,408 --> 02:36:28,437

You hold my hand but hold back so much
Some things change and some things don't
Something I can't put my finger on baby you're not in love

I've tried to be the boy you knew
So I cut my hair and I cleaned my shoes
But I'd be cheating on myself
Saying we could make it through baby you're not in love

Love is cruel, love is hard
Love it makes you blue
Grips your heart without regard
For the ones who don't love you

515,It Do Feel Good,"I'm kicking my heel together
Free again
I feel like me again
I know without a doubt I'm in love, love, love

And I don't have to make believe
Or feed a guilty conscience
Love set me free
And it do feel good

I just went through this painful thing
Of questions without answers
Kept coming back with nothing for the longest time
My heart kept racing with my conscience
And claiming all my daydreames

Wait out in front of my mind
And that awful gnawing feeling
Like you're gonna die from hunger
You don't find out where you're going
And how to get there
But now it's worth all that confusion
'Cause I found me an answer

And I know love is alive again within me
I'm kickin' my heel together...

I've finally figured out
How yesterdays fit into tomorrows
And I've learned that little doubts
Are just unfinished dreams
And I guess I'll keep on learning the same lessons all over
And nothing is as bad as it seems

And I've just got to accept the fact
That I have to accept the fact
That love goes through changes just like we do
And an occasional distraction a little quiet a little action
And a whole lot of patience will make it grow

I'm kickin' my heel together...
I'm kickin' my heel together...
I'm kickin' my heel together...",Donna Fargo,1975,"[98, 98]",2

Holdin' on to each other's hand

Sunlight dancin' off her pretty face
Man, those were the days
Been washed away like our names in the sand with the waves

Where she is now

How she got gone when i never let her go

Sometime when the wind is right
I can see us there on a summer night
With a blanket down, looking up at the starry sky
So in love that goodnight kiss never felt so sweet

But like the leaves, on an autumn tree
When the summer's gone, so was she

Living life with no regrets
I wish I could say the same for me
But I ain't got there

I lost everything

Why you cut off our ties?
I was buildin' an empire for you and I
Shawty I live for you, shawty I'd kill for you

Dear God - remember how we talked about the future?
Remember our three kids, a mansion and my music?

528,Devil In The Bottle,"[Verse]
Well, there's a devil in the bottle, staring straight at me
Daring me to reach out, but I know he's testing me
If I take just one sip, I become that devil's son
Act a fool, sell my soul before God and everyone
Oh Lord, I know, I only hurt the ones I love
I'm walking down this dead end road, all alone and by myself
Wish I could blame the whiskey, but I can only blame myself
Running out of chances, and Lord that's such a crime
I got to find the answer before I lose my mind
Oh Lord its a crying shame, oh Lord I've caused so much pain
I only hurt the ones I love
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be
So many times I've been hurting my soul and family
But I got free on the day I fought the
Devil in the bottle
The next time that ol' devil tries to get the best of me
I'll smash that bottle against the wall and know I'm finally free
There's a devil in a bottle that just won't let me be
There's so many times I let him hurt me

529,Doctor's Orders,"[Verse 1: Solo]
I'm lookin' for a sign and it ain't coming, I'm cuttin' ties
My days disappear in clouds, I stay blunted
Doctors orders, focus on what's important
Keep the profile low as I cross the border
Mr Sol to the O, just a day in a life
Got me all dressed up with nowhere to go
Oh well, lonely nights living out a hotel
Scheming on the prize, piece of mind like a nobel
In the meantime, I'm tryna travel light
Less weight to carry like you gotta pick your battles right
The best defense, I'm on the attack, under
False pretense I wanna react, holding me back
Till my chest tighter than my grip
I might do better if I just let it slip
Hot blood up against cold steel
Careful how you wield or you might be the one to feel

[Hook: Solo & Urthboy & Muphin]
Make no mistake
Anger is a curved blade
You can get cut in the worst way
'Cause you were better off in the first place
If you grip it too tight
Might wind up with a burst vein
And that's real, be careful how you wield
Or you might be the one to feel
Make no mistake, anger is a curved blade
You can get cut in the worst way
'Cause you were better off in the first place
If you grip it too tight
Might wind up with a burst vein
And that's real, be careful how you wield
Or you might be the one to feel

[Verse 2: Urthboy]
Hey sucker, I'd have wished you the worst
Wish you'd have tripped, put my fist in your words
Rip you to pieces, shredded to a blur
Fall like confetti, a shadow of whatever you were
Closed the door like ""do not disturb""
Reduce your whole book to a blurb
As far as I'm concerned, let the pages burn
Let the tears confirm that your career's adjourned
And I just set my mind to your downfall
Like it's somehow set our watches
And preoccupied my time with your misfortune
Till it'd become unconscious
Followed my compass to schadenfreude but cold comfort
Called back, 'cause when you fell I just fell flat
So go for yours, I'll go for mine, ha
To wish you ill is just a waste of my time
C'mon

[Verse 3: Muphin]
We hit the ground, about to be goin' our separate ways
I can feel us slowing down, dems the brakes
We exit the plane
When there's nothing left to say that hasn't been said
So I'm saying goodbye, that's it, I jet
Now I'm a Sunday Gentleman with a pen in my hand
Never thought much about that exit plan
For all the resentment that I let get in the way
Here I am as I stand, still a wannabe Hemingway
Tryin' to make every page better than the last
Same way I live life try and let go of the past
Fuck a double edge blade I'm tryna keep the pen mighty
Up all night, too tired to keep fighting
Doctor's orders, more bottles of water
What kind of dad would you wanna be for your daughter?
The soberin' thought of war, what is it good for?
As if they force my hand
To draw blood with this blade
Until I'm falling on my own sword, sure
And who's that gonna save?

And we'll find a way
Before our day is done
Look in my eyes pretty woman
And we'll overcome

Love, my guiding star
You're my faith, my hope, my power
When I just can't find a reason to believe
Ooh Ooh

Touch my hand with love
And you light my darkest hour
I can feel the warmth returning
And the pain about to leave

Cause when you look in my eyes pretty woman
The world is a peaceful place
All I can see when there's you and just me
Is love upon your face

548,Junior's Farm/Sally G,"                                      PLACE-NAMES: THE PLACE

MY FIRST VISIT TO BALBEC — FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF M. DE CHARLUS AND OF ROBERT DE SAINT-LOUP — DINNER WITH BLOCH AND HIS FAMILY

   I had arrived at a state almost of complete indifference to Gilberte when, two years later, I went with my grandmother to Balbec. When I succumbed to the attraction of a strange face, when it was with the help of some other girl that I hoped to discover gothic cathedrals, the palaces and gardens of Italy, I said to myself sadly that this love of ours, in so far as it is love for one particular creature, is not perhaps a very real thing, since if the association of pleasant or unpleasant trains of thought can attach it for a time to a woman so as to make us believe that it has been inspired by her, in a necessary sequence of effect to cause, yet when we detach ourselves, deliberately or unconsciously, from those associations, this love, as though it were indeed a spontaneous thing and sprang from ourselves alone, will revive in order to bestow itself on another woman. At the time, however, of my departure for Balbec, and during the earlier part of my stay there, my indifference was still only intermittent. Often, our life being so careless of chronology, interpolating so many anachronisms in the sequence of our days, I lived still among those — far older days than yesterday or last week — in which I loved Gilberte. And at once not seeing her became as exquisite a torture to me as it had been then. The self that had loved her, which another self had already almost entirely supplanted, rose again in me, stimulated far more often by a trivial than by an important event. For instance, if I may anticipate for a moment my arrival in Normandy, I heard some one who passed me on the sea-front at Balbec refer to the ‘Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and his family.’ Now, seeing that as yet I knew nothing of the influence which that family was to exercise over my life, this remark ought to have passed unheeded; instead, it gave me at once an acute twinge, which a self that had for the most part long since been outgrown in me felt at being parted from Gilberte. Because I had never given another thought to a conversation which Gilberte had had with her father in my hearing, in which allusion was made to the Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and to his family. Now our love memories present no exception to the general rules of memory, which in turn are governed by the still more general rules of Habit. And as Habit weakens every impression, what a person recalls to us most vividly is precisely what we had forgotten, because it was of no importance, and had therefore left in full possession of its strength. That is why the better part of our memory exists outside ourselves, in a blatter of rain, in the smell of an unaired room or of the first crackling brushwood fire in a cold grate: wherever, in short, we happen upon what our mind, having no use for it, had rejected, the last treasure that the past has in store, the richest, that which when all our flow of tears seems to have dried at the source can make us weep again. Outside ourselves, did I say; rather within ourselves, but hidden from our eyes in an oblivion more or less prolonged. It is thanks to this oblivion alone that we can from time to time recover the creature that we were, range ourselves face to face with past events as that creature had to face them, suffer afresh because we are no longer ourselves but he, and because he loved what leaves us now indifferent. In the broad daylight of our ordinary memory the images of the past turn gradually pale and fade out of sight, nothing remains of them, we shall never find them again. Or rather we should never find them again had not a few words (such as this ‘Secretary to the Ministry of Posts’) been carefully locked away in oblivion, just as an author deposits in the National Library a copy of a book which might otherwise become unobtainable

   But this suffering and this recrudescence of my love for Gilberte lasted no longer than such things last in a dream, and this time, on the contrary, because at Balbec the old Habit was no longer there to keep them alive. And if these two effects of Habit appear to be incompatible, that is because Habit is bound by a diversity of laws. In Paris I had grown more and more indifferent to Gilberte, thanks to Habit. The change of habit, that is to say the temporary cessation of Habit, completed Habit’s task when I started for Balbec. It weakens, but it stabilises; it leads to disintegration but it makes the scattered elements last indefinitely. Day after day, for years past, I had begun by modelling my state of mind, more or less effectively, upon that of the day before. At Balbec, a strange bed, to the side of which a tray was brought in the morning that differed from my Paris breakfast tray, could not, obviously, sustain the fancies upon which my love for Gilberte had fed: there are cases (though not, I admit, commonly) in which, one’s days being paralysed by a sedentary life, the best way to save time is to change one’s place of residence. My journey to Balbec was like the first outing of a convalescent who needed only that to convince him that he was cured

   The journey was one that would now be made, probably, in a motorcar, which would be supposed to render it more interesting. We shall see too that, accomplished in such a way, it would even be in a sense more genuine, since one would be following more nearly, in a closer intimacy, the various contours by which the surface of the earth is wrinkled. But after all the special attraction of the journey lies not in our being able to alight at places on the way and to stop altogether as soon as we grow tired, but in its making the difference between departure and arrival not as imperceptible but as intense as possible, so that we are conscious of it in its totality, intact, as it existed in our mind when imagination bore us from the place in which we were living right to the very heart of a place we longed to see, in a single sweep which seemed miraculous to us not so much because it covered a certain distance as because it united two distinct individualities of the world, took us from one name to another name; and this difference is accentuated (more than in a form of locomotion in which, since one can stop and alight where one chooses, there can scarcely be said to be any point of arrival) by the mysterious operation that is performed in those peculiar places, railway stations, which do not constitute, so to speak, a part of the surrounding town but contain the essence of its personality just as upon their sign-boards they bear its painted name

   But in this respect as in every other, our age is infected with a mania for shewing things only in the environment that properly belongs to them, thereby suppressing the essential thing, the act of the mind which isolated them from that environment. A picture is nowadays ‘presented’ in the midst of furniture, ornaments, hangings of the same period, a secondhand scheme of decoration in the composition of which in the houses of to-day excels that same hostess who but yesterday was so crassly ignorant, but now spends her time poring over records and in libraries; and among these the masterpiece at which we glance up from the table while we dine does not give us that exhilarating delight which we can expect from it only in a public gallery, which symbolises far better by its bareness, by the absence of all irritating detail, those innermost spaces into which the artist withdrew to create it

   Unhappily those marvellous places which are railway stations, from which one sets out for a remote destination, are tragic places also, for if in them the miracle is accomplished whereby scenes which hitherto have had no existence save in our minds are to become the scenes among which we shall be living, for that very reason we must, as we emerge from the waiting-room, abandon any thought of finding ourself once again within the familiar walls which, but a moment ago, were still enclosing us. We must lay aside all hope of going home to sleep in our own bed, once we have made up our mind to penetrate into the pestiferous cavern through which we may have access to the mystery, into one of those vast, glass-roofed sheds, like that of Saint-Lazare into which I must go to find the train for Balbec, and which extended over the rent bowels of the city one of those bleak and boundless skies, heavy with an accumulation of dramatic menaces, like certain skies painted with an almost Parisian modernity by Mantegna or Veronese, beneath which could be accomplished only some solemn and tremendous act, such as a departure by train or the Elevation of the Cross

   So long as I had been content to look out from the warmth of my own bed in Paris at the Persian church of Balbec, shrouded in driving sleet, no sort of objection to this journey had been offered by my body. Its objections began only when it had gathered that it would have itself to take part in the journey, and that on the evening of my arrival I should be shewn to ‘my’ room which to my body would be unknown. Its revolt was all the more deep-rooted in that on the very eve of my departure I learned that my mother would not be coming with us, my father, who would be kept busy at the Ministry until it was time for him to start for Spain with M. de Norpois, having preferred to take a house in the neighbourhood of Paris. On the other hand, the spectacle of Balbec seemed to me none the less desirable because I must purchase it at the price of a discomfort which, on the contrary, I felt to indicate and to guarantee the reality of the impression which I was going there to seek, an impression the place of which no spectacle of professedly equal value, no ‘panorama’ which I might have gone to see without being thereby precluded from returning home to sleep in my own bed, could possibly have filled. It was not for the first time that I felt that those who love and those who find pleasure are not always the same. I believed myself to be longing fully as much for Balbec as the doctor who was treating me, when he said to me, surprised, on the morning of our departure, to see me look so unhappy, “I don’t mind telling you that if I could only manage a week to go down and get a blow by the sea, I shouldn’t wait to be asked twice. You’ll be having races, regattas; you don’t know what all!” But I had already learned the lesson — long before I was taken to hear Berma — that, whatever it might be that I loved, it would never be attained save at the end of a long and heart-rending pursuit, in the course of which I should have first to sacrifice my own pleasure to that paramount good instead of seeking it there

   My grandmother, naturally enough, looked upon our exodus from a somewhat different point of view, and (for she was still as anxious as ever that the presents which were made me should take some artistic form) had planned, so that she might be offering me, of this journey, a ‘print’ that was, at least, in parts ‘old,’ that we should repeat, partly by rail and partly by road, the itinerary that Mme. de Sévigné followed when she went from Paris to ‘L’Orient’ by way of Chaulnes and ‘the Pont-Audemer.’ But my grandmother had been obliged to abandon this project, at the instance of my father who knew, whenever she organised any expedition with a view to extracting from it the utmost intellectual benefit that it was capable of yielding, what a tale there would be to tell of missed trains, lost luggage, sore throats and broken rules. She was free at least to rejoice in the thought that never, when the time came for us to sally forth to the beach, should we be exposed to the risk of being kept indoors by the sudden appearance of what her beloved Sévigné calls a ‘beast of a coachload,’ since we should know not a soul at Balbec, Legrandin having refrained from offering us a letter of introduction to his sister. (This abstention had not been so well appreciated by my aunts Céline and Flora, who, having known as a child that lady, of whom they had always spoken until then, to commemorate this early intimacy, as ‘Renée de Cambremer,’ and having had from her and still possessing a number of those little presents which continue to ornament a room or a conversation but to which the feeling between the parties no longer corresponds, imagined that they were avenging the insult offered to us by never uttering again, when they called upon Mme. Legrandin, the name of her daughter, confining themselves to a mutual congratulation, once they were safely out of the house: “I made no reference to you know whom!” “I think that went home!”)

   And so we were simply to leave Paris by that one twenty-two train which I had too often beguiled myself by looking out in the railway timetable, where its itinerary never failed to give me the emotion, almost the illusion of starting by it, not to feel that I already knew it. As the delineation in our mind of the features of any form of happiness depends more on the nature of the longings that it inspires in us than on the accuracy of the information which we have about it, I felt that I knew this train in all its details, nor did I doubt that I should feel, sitting in one of its compartments, a special delight as the day began to cool, should be contemplating this or that view as the train approached one or another station; so much so that this train, which always brought to my mind’s eye the images of the same towns, which I bathed in the sunlight of those post-meridian hours through which it sped, seemed to me to be different from every other train; and I had ended — as we are apt to do with a person whom we have never seen but of whom we like to believe that we have won his friendship — by giving a distinct and unalterable cast of countenance to the traveller, artistic, golden-haired, who would thus have taken me with him upon his journey, and to whom I should bid farewell beneath the Cathedral of Saint-Lo, before he hastened to overtake the setting sun

   As my grandmother could not bring herself to do anything so ‘stupid’ as to go straight to Balbec, she was to break the journey half-way, staying the night with one of her friends, from whose house I was to proceed the same evening, so as not to be in the way there and also in order that I might arrive by daylight and see Balbec Church, which, we had learned, was at some distance from Balbec-Plage, so that I might not have a chance to visit it later on, when I had begun my course of baths. And perhaps it was less painful for me to feel that the desirable goal of my journey stood between me and that cruel first night on which I should have to enter a new habitation, and consent to dwell there. But I had had first to leave the old; my mother had arranged to ‘move in,’ that afternoon, at Saint-Cloud, and had made, or pretended to make, all the arrangements for going there directly after she had seen us off at the station, without needing to call again at our own house to which she was afraid that I might otherwise feel impelled at the last moment, instead of going to Balbec, to return with her. In fact, on the pretext of having so much to see to in the house which she had just taken and of being pressed for time, but in reality so as to spare me the cruel ordeal of a long-drawn parting, she had decided not to wait with us until that moment of the signal to start at which, concealed hitherto among ineffective comings and goings and preparations that lead to nothing definite, separation is made suddenly manifest, impossible to endure when it is no longer possibly to be avoided, concentrated in its entirety in one enormous instant of impotent and supreme lucidity

   For the first time I began to feel that it was possible that my mother might live without me, otherwise than for me, a separate life. She was going to stay with my father, whose existence it may have seemed to her that my feeble health, my nervous excitability complicated somewhat and saddened. This separation made me all the more wretched because I told myself that it probably marked for my mother an end of the successive disappointments which I had caused her, of which she had never said a word to me but which had made her realise the difficulty of our taking our holidays together; and perhaps also the first trial of a form of existence to which she was beginning, now, to resign herself for the future, as the years crept on for my father and herself, an existence in which I should see less of her, in which (a thing that not even in my nightmares had yet been revealed to me) she would already have become something of a stranger, a lady who might be seen going home by herself to a house in which I should not be, asking the porter whether there was not a letter for her from me

   I could scarcely answer the man in the station who offered to take my bag. My mother, to comfort me, tried the methods which seemed to her most efficacious. Thinking it to be useless to appear not to notice my unhappiness, she gently teased me about it:

    “Well, and what would Balbec church say if it knew that people pulled long faces like that when they were going to see it? Surely this is not the enraptured tourist Ruskin speaks of. Besides, I shall know if you rise to the occasion, even when we are miles apart I shall still be with my little man. You shall have a letter to-morrow from Mamma.”

    “My dear,” said my grandmother, “I picture you like Mme. de Sévigné, your eyes glued to the map, and never losing sight of us for an instant.”

   Then Mamma sought to distract my mind, asked me what I thought of having for dinner, drew my attention to Françoise, complimented her on a hat and cloak which she did not recognise, in spite of their having horrified her long ago when she first saw them, new, upon my great-aunt, one with an immense bird towering over it, the other decorated with a hideous pattern and jet beads. But the cloak having grown too shabby to wear, Françoise had had it turned, exposing an ‘inside’ of plain cloth and quite a good colour. As for the bird, it had long since come to grief and been thrown away. And just as it is disturbing, sometimes, to find the effects which the most conscious artists attain only by an effort occurring in a folk-song, on the wall of some peasant’s cottage where above the door, at the precisely right spot in the composition, blooms a white or yellow rose — so the velvet band, the loop of ribbon which would have delighted one in a portrait by Chardin or Whistler, Françoise had set with a simple but unerring taste upon the hat, which was now charming

   To take a parallel from an earlier age, the modesty and integrity which often gave an air of nobility to the face of our old servant having spread also to the garments which, as a woman reserved but not humbled, who knew how to hold her own and to keep her place, she had put on for the journey so as to be fit to be seen in our company without at the same time seeming or wishing to make herself conspicuous — Françoise in the cherry-coloured cloth, now faded, of her cloak, and the discreet nap of her fur collar, brought to mind one of those miniatures of Anne of Brittany painted in Books of Hours by an old master, in which everything is so exactly in the right place, the sense of the whole is so evenly distributed throughout the parts that the rich and obsolete singularity of the costume expresses the same pious gravity as the eyes, lips and hands

   Of thought, in relation to Françoise, one could hardly speak. She knew nothing, in that absolute sense in which to know nothing means to understand nothing, save the rare truths to which the heart is capable of directly attaining. The vast world of ideas existed not for her. But when one studied the clearness of her gaze, the lines of nose and lips, all those signs lacking from so many people of culture in whom they would else have signified a supreme distinction, the noble detachment of a chosen spirit, one was disquieted, as one is by the frank, intelligent eyes of a dog, to which, nevertheless, one knows that all our human concepts must be alien, and was led to ask oneself whether there might not be, among those other humble brethren, our peasant countrymen, creatures who were, like the great ones of the earth, of simple mind, or rather, doomed by a harsh fate to live among the simple-minded, deprived of heavenly light, were yet more naturally, more instinctively akin to the chosen spirits than most educated people, were, so to speak, all members, though scattered, straying, robbed of their heritage of reason, of the celestial family, kinsfolk, that have been lost in infancy, of the loftiest minds to whom — as is apparent from the unmistakable light in their eyes, although they can concentrate that light on nothing — there has been lacking, to endow them with talent, knowledge only

   My mother, seeing that I had difficulty in keeping back my tears, said to me: “‘Regulus was in the habit, when things looked grave. . . . ’ Besides, it isn’t nice for Mamma! What does Mme. de Sévigné say? Your grandmother will tell you: ‘I shall be obliged to draw upon all the courage that you lack.’” And remembering that affection for another distracts one’s selfish griefs, she endeavoured to beguile me by telling me that she expected the removal to Saint-Cloud to go without a hitch, that she liked the cab, which she had kept waiting, that the driver seemed civil and the seats comfortable. I made an effort to smile at these trifles, and bowed my head with an air of acquiescence and satisfaction. But they helped me only to depict to myself with more accuracy Mamma’s imminent departure, and it was with an agonised heart that I gazed at her as though she were already torn from me, beneath that wide-brimmed straw hat which she had bought to wear in the country, in a flimsy dress which she had put on in view of the long drive through the sweltering midday heat; hat and dress making her some one else, some one who belonged already to the Villa Montretout, in which I should not see her

   To prevent the choking fits which the journey might otherwise give me the doctor had advised me to take, as we started, a good stiff dose of beer or brandy, so as to begin the journey in a state of what he called ‘euphoria,’ in which the nervous system is for a time less vulnerable. I had not yet made up my mind whether I should do this, but I wished at least that my grandmother should admit that, if I did so decide, I should have wisdom and authority on my side. I spoke therefore as if my hesitation were concerned only with where I should go for my drink, to the bar on the platform or to the restaurant-car on the train. But immediately, at the air of reproach which my grandmother’s face assumed, an air of not wishing even to entertain such an idea for a moment, “What!” I said to myself, suddenly determining upon this action of going out to drink, the performance of which became necessary as a proof of my independence since the verbal announcement of it had not succeeded in passing unchallenged, “What! You know how ill I am, you know what the doctor ordered, and you treat me like this!”

   When I had explained to my grandmother how unwell I felt, her distress, her kindness were so apparent as she replied, “Run along then, quickly; get yourself some beer or a liqueur if it will do you any good,” that I flung myself upon her, almost smothering her in kisses. And if after that I went and drank a great deal too much in the restaurant-car of the train, that was because I felt that otherwise I should have a more violent attack than usual, which was just what would vex her most. When at the first stop I clambered back into our compartment I told my grandmother how pleased I was to be going to Balbec, that I felt that everything would go off splendidly, that after all I should soon grow used to being without Mamma, that the train was most comfortable, the steward and attendants in the bar so friendly that I should like to make the journey often so as to have opportunities of seeing them again. My grandmother, however, did not appear to feel the same joy as myself at all these good tidings. She answered, without looking me in the face:

    “Why don’t you try to get a little sleep?” and turned her gaze to the window, the blind of which, though we had drawn it, did not completely cover the glass, so that the sun could and did slip in over the polished oak of the door and the cloth of the seat (like an advertisement of a life shared with nature far more persuasive than those posted higher upon the walls of the compartment, by the railway company, representing places in the country the names of which I could not make out from where I sat) the same warm and slumberous light which lies along a forest glade

   But when my grandmother thought that my eyes were shut I could see her, now and again, from among the large black spots on her veil, steal a glance at me, then withdraw it, and steal back again, like a person trying to make himself, so as to get into the habit, perform some exercise that hurts him

   Thereupon I spoke to her, but that seemed not to please her either. And yet to myself the sound of my own voice was pleasant, as were the most imperceptible, the most internal movements of my body. And so I endeavoured to prolong it. I allowed each of my inflexions to hang lazily upon its word, I felt each glance from my eyes arrive just at the spot to which it was directed and stay there beyond the normal period. “Now, now, sit still and rest,” said my grandmother. “If you can’t manage to sleep, read something.” And she handed me a volume of Madame de Sévigné which I opened, while she buried herself in the Mémoires de Madame de Beausergent. She never travelled anywhere without a volume of each. They were her two favourite authors. With no conscious movement of my head, feeling a keen pleasure in maintaining a posture after I had adopted it, I lay back holding in my hands the volume of Madame de Sévigné which I had allowed to close, without lowering my eyes to it, or indeed letting them see anything but the blue window-blind. But the contemplation of this blind appeared to me an admirable thing, and I should not have troubled to answer anyone who might have sought to distract me from contemplating it. The blue colour of this blind seemed to me, not perhaps by its beauty but by its intense vivacity, to efface so completely all the colours that had passed before my eyes from the day of my birth up to the moment in which I had gulped down the last of my drink and it had begun to take effect, that when compared with this blue they were as drab, as void as must be retrospectively the darkness in which he has lived to a man born blind whom a subsequent operation has at length enabled to see and to distinguish colours. An old ticket-collector came to ask for our tickets. The silvery gleam that shone from the metal buttons of his jacket charmed me in spite of my absorption. I wanted to ask him to sit down beside us. But he passed on to the next carriage, and I thought with longing of the life led by railwaymen for whom, since they spent all their time on the line, hardly a day could pass without their seeing this’ old collector. The pleasure that I found in staring at the blind, and in feeling that my mouth was half-open, began at length to diminish. I became more mobile; I even moved in my seat; I opened the book that my grandmother had given me and turned its pages casually, reading whatever caught my eye. And as I read I felt my admiration for Madame de Sévigné grow

   It is a mistake to let oneself be taken in by the purely formal details, idioms of the period or social conventions, the effect of which is that certain people believe that they have caught the Sévigné manner when they have said: “Tell me, my dear,” or “That Count struck me as being a man of parts,” or “Haymaking is the sweetest thing in the world.” Mme. de Simiane imagines already that she is being like her grandmother because she can write: “M. de la Boulie is bearing wonderfully, Sir, and is in excellent condition to hear the news of his death,” or “Oh, my dear Marquis, how your letter enchanted me! What can I do but answer it?” or “Meseems, Sir, that you owe me a letter, and I owe you some boxes of bergamot. I discharge my debt to the number of eight; others shall follow. . . . Never has the soil borne so many. Apparently for your gratification.” And she writes in this style also her letter on bleeding, on lemons and so forth, supposing it to be typical of the letters of Madame de Sévigné. But my grandmother who had approached that lady from within, attracted to her by her own love of kinsfolk and of nature, had taught me to enjoy the real beauties of her correspondence, which are altogether different. They were presently to strike me all the more forcibly inasmuch as Madame de Sévigné is a great artist of the same school as a painter whom I was to meet at Balbec, where his influence on my way of seeing things was immense. I realised at Balbec that it was in the same way as he that she presented things to her readers, in the order of our perception of them, instead of first having to explain them in relation to their several causes. But already that afternoon in the railway carriage, as I read over again that letter in which the moonlight comes: “I cannot resist the temptation: I put on all my bonnets and veils, though there is no need of them, I walk along this mall, where the air is as sweet as in my chamber; I find a thousand phantasms, monks white and black, sisters grey and white, linen cast here and there on the ground, men enshrouded upright against the tree-trunks,” I was enraptured by what, a little later, I should have described (for does not she draw landscapes in the same way as he draws characters?) as the Dostoievsky side of Madame de Sévigné‘s Letters

   When, that evening, after having accompanied my grandmother to her destination and spent some hours in her friend’s house, I had returned by myself to the train, at any rate I found nothing to distress me in the night which followed; this was because I had not to spend it in a room the somnolence of which would have kept me awake; I was surrounded by the soothing activity of all those movements of the train which kept me company, offered to stay and converse with me if I could not sleep, lulled me with their sounds which I wedded — as I had often wedded the chime of the Combray bells — now to one rhythm, now to another (hearing as the whim took me first four level and equivalent semi-quavers, then one semi-quaver furiously dashing against a crotchet); they neutralised the centrifugal force of my insomnia by exercising upon it a contrary pressure which kept me in equilibrium and on which my immobility and presently my drowsiness felt themselves to be borne with the same sense of refreshment that I should have had, had I been resting under the protecting vigilance of powerful forces, on the breast of nature and of life, had I been able for a moment to incarnate myself in a fish that sleeps in the sea, driven unheeding by the currents and the tides, or in an eagle outstretched upon the air, with no support but the storm

   Sunrise is a necessary concomitant of long railway journeys, just as are hard-boiled eggs, illustrated papers, packs of cards, rivers upon which boats strain but make no progress. At a certain moment — when I was counting over the thoughts that had filled my mind, in the preceding minutes, so as to discover whether I had just been asleep or not (and when the very uncertainty which made me ask myself the question was to furnish me with an affirmative answer), in the pale square of the window, over a small black wood I saw some ragged clouds whose fleecy edges were of a fixed, dead pink, not liable to change, like the colour that dyes the wing which has grown to wear it, or the sketch upon which the artist’s fancy has washed it. But I felt that, unlike them, this colour was due neither to inertia nor to caprice but to necessity and life. Presently there gathered behind it reserves of light. It brightened; the sky turned to a crimson which I strove, gluing my eyes to the window, to see more clearly, for I felt that it was related somehow to the most intimate life of Nature, but, the course of the line altering, the train turned, the morning scene gave place in the frame of the window to a nocturnal village, its roofs still blue with moonlight, its pond encrusted with the opalescent nacre of night, beneath a firmament still powdered with all its stars, and I was lamenting the loss of my strip of pink sky when I caught sight of it afresh, but red this time, in the opposite window which it left at a second bend in the line, so that I spent my time running from one window to the other to reassemble, to collect oh a single canvas the intermittent, antipodean fragments of my fine, scarlet, ever-changing morning, and to obtain a comprehensive view of it and a continuous picture

   The scenery became broken, abrupt, the train stopped at a little station between two mountains. Far down the gorge, on the edge of a hurrying Stream, one could see only a solitary watch-house, deep-planted in the water which ran past on a level with its windows. If a person can be the product of a soil the peculiar charm of which one distinguishes in that person, more even than the peasant girl whom I had so desperately longed to see appear when I wandered by myself along the Méséglise way, in the woods of Roussainville, such a person must be the big girl whom I now saw emerge from the house and, climbing a path lighted by the first slanting rays of the sun, come towards the station carrying a jar of milk. In her valley from which its congregated summits hid the rest of the world, she could never see anyone save in these trains which stopped for a moment only. She passed down the line of windows, offering coffee and milk to a few awakened passengers. Purpled with the glow of morning, her face was rosier than the sky. I felt in her presence that desire to live which is reborn in us whenever we become conscious anew of beauty and of happiness. We invariably forget that these are individual qualities, and, substituting for them in our mind a conventional type at which we arrive by striking a sort of mean amongst the different faces that have taken our fancy, the pleasures we have known, we are left with mere abstract images which are lifeless and dull because they are lacking in precisely that element of novelty, different from anything we have known, that element which is proper to beauty and to happiness. And we deliver on life a pessimistic judgment which we suppose to be fair, for we believed that we were taking into account when we formed it happiness and beauty, whereas in fact we left them out and replaced them by syntheses in which there is not a single atom of either. So it is that a well-read man will at once begin to yawn with boredom when anyone speaks to him of a new ‘good book,’ because he imagines a sort of composite of all the good books that he has read and knows already, whereas a good book is something special, something incalculable, and is made up not of the sum of all previous masterpieces but of something which the most thorough assimilation of every one of them would not enable him to discover, since it exists not in their sum but beyond it. Once he has become acquainted with this new work, the well-read man, till then apathetic, feels his interest awaken in the reality which it depicts. So, alien to the models of beauty which my fancy was won't to sketch when I was by myself, this strapping girl gave me at once the sensation of a certain happiness (the sole form, always different, in which we may learn the sensation of happiness), of a happiness that would be realised by my staying and living there by her side. But in this again the temporary cessation of Habit played a great part. I was giving the milk-girl the benefit of what was really my own entire being, ready to taste the keenest joys, which now confronted her. As a rule it is with our being reduced to a minimum that we live, most of our faculties lie dormant because they can rely upon Habit, which knows what there is to be done and has no need of their services. But on this morning of travel, the interruption of the routine of my existence, the change of place and time, had made their presence indispensable. My habits, which were sedentary and not matutinal, played me false, and all my faculties came hurrying to take their place, vying with one another in their zeal, rising, each of them, like waves in a storm, to the same unaccustomed level, from the basest to the most exalted, from breath, appetite, the circulation of my blood to receptivity and imagination. I cannot say whether, so as to make me believe that this girl was unlike the rest of women, the rugged charm of these barren tracts had been added to her own, but if so she gave it back to them. Life would have seemed an exquisite thing to me if only I had been free to spend it, hour after hour, with her, to go with her to the stream, to the cow, to the train, to be always at her side, to feel that I was known to her, had my place in her thoughts. She would have initiated me into the delights of country life and of the first hours of the day. I signalled to her to give me some of her coffee. I felt that I must be noticed by her. She did not see me; I called to her. Above her body, which was of massive build, the complexion of her face was so burnished and so ruddy that she appeared almost as though I were looking at her through a lighted window. She had turned and was coming towards me; I could not take my eyes from her face which grew larger as she approached, like a sun which it was somehow possible to arrest in its course and draw towards one, letting itself be seen at close quarters, blinding the eyes with its blaze of red and gold. She fastened on me her penetrating stare, but while the porters ran along the platform shutting doors the train had begun to move. I saw her leave the station and go down the hill to her home; it was broad daylight now; I was speeding away from the dawn. Whether my exaltation had been produced by this girl or had on the other hand been responsible for most of the pleasure that I had found in the sight of her, in the sense of her presence, in either event she was so closely associated with it that my desire to see her again was really not so much a physical as a mental desire, not to allow this state of enthusiasm to perish utterly, not to be separated for ever from the person who, although quite unconsciously, had participated in it. It was not only because this state was a pleasant one. It was principally because (just as increased tension upon a cord or accelerated vibration of a nerve produces a different sound or colour) it gave another tonality to all that I saw, introduced me as an actor upon the stage of an unknown and infinitely more interesting universe; that handsome girl whom I still could see, while the train gathered speed, was like part of a life other than the life that I knew, separated from it by a clear boundary, in which the sensations that things produced in me were no longer the same, from which to return now to my old life would be almost suicide. To procure myself the pleasure of feeling that I had at least an attachment to this new life, it would suffice that I should live near enough to the little station to be able to come to it every morning for a cup of coffee from the girl. But alas, she must be for ever absent from the other life towards which I was being borne with ever increasing swiftness, a life to the prospect of which I resigned myself only by weaving plans that would enable me to take the same train again some day and to stop at the same station, a project which would have the further advantage of providing with subject matter the selfish, active, practical, mechanical, indolent, centrifugal tendency which is that of the human mind; for our mind turns readily aside from the effort which is required if it is to analyse in itself, in a general and disinterested manner, a pleasant impression which we have received. And as, on the other hand, we wish to continue to think of that impression, the mind prefers to imagine it in the future tense, which while it gives us no clue as to the real nature of the thing, saves us the trouble of recreating it in our own consciousness and allows us to hope that we may receive it afresh from without

   Certain names of towns, Vezelay or Chartres, Bourses or Beauvais, serve to indicate, by abbreviation, the principal church in those towns. This partial acceptation, in which we are so accustomed to take the word, comes at length — if the names in question are those of places that we do not yet know — to fashion for us a mould of the name as a solid whole, which from that time onwards, whenever we wish it to convey the idea of the town — of that town which we have never seen — will impose on it, as on a cast, the same carved outlines, in the same style of art, will make of the town a sort of vast cathedral. It was, nevertheless, in a railway-station, above the door of a refreshment-room, that I read the name — almost Persian in style — of Balbec. I strode buoyantly through the station and across the avenue that led past it, I asked my way to the beach so as to see nothing in the place but its church and the sea; people seemed not to understand what I meant. Old Balbec, Balbec-en-Terre, at which I had arrived, had neither beach nor harbour. It was, most certainly, in the sea that the fishermen had found, according to the legend, the miraculous Christ, of which a window in the church that stood a few yards from where I now was recorded the discovery; it was indeed from cliffs battered by the waves that had been quarried the stone of its navfc and towers. But this sea, which for those reasons I had imagined as flowing up to die at the foot of the window, was twelve miles away and more, at Balbec-Plage, and, rising beside its cupola, that steeple, which, because I had read that it was itself a rugged Norman cliff on which seeds were blown and sprouted, round which the sea-birds wheeled, I had always pictured to myself as receiving at its base the last drying foam of the uplifted waves, stood on a Square from which two lines of tramway diverged, opposite a Café which bore, written in letters of gold, the word ‘Billiards’; it stood out against a background of houses with the roofs of which no upstanding mast was blended. And the church — entering my mind with the Café, with the passing stranger of whom I had had to ask my way, with the station to which presently I should have to return — made part of the general whole, seemed an accident, a by-product of this summer afternoon, in which its mellow and distended dome against the sky was like a fruit of which the same light that bathed the chimneys of the houses was ripening the skin, pink, glowing, melting-soft. But I wished only to consider the eternal significance of the carvings when I recognised the Apostles, which I had seen in casts in the Trocadéro museum, and which on either side of the Virgin, before the deep bay of the porch, were awaiting me as though to do me reverence. With their benign, blunt, mild faces and bowed shoulders they seemed to be advancing upon me with an air of welcome, singing the Alleluia of a fine day. But it was evident that their expression was unchanging as that on a dead man’s face, and could be modified only by my turning about to look at them in different aspects. I said to myself: “Here I am: this is the Church of Balbec. This square, which looks as though it were conscious of its glory, is the only place in the world that possesses Balbec Church. All that I have seen so far have been photographs of this church — and of these famous Apostles, this Virgin of the Porch, mere casts only. Now it is the church itself, the statue itself; these are they; they, the unique things — this is something far greater.”

   It was something less, perhaps, also. As a young man on the day of an examination or of a duel feels the question that he has been asked, the shot that he has fired, to be a very little thing when he thinks of the reserves of knowledge and of valour that he possesses and would like to have displayed, so my mind, which had exalted the Virgin of the Porch far above the reproductions that I had had before my eyes, inaccessible by the vicissitudes which had power to threaten them, intact although they were destroyed, ideal, endowed with universal value, was astonished to see the statue which it had carved a thousand times, reduced now to its own apparent form in stone, occupying, on the radius of my outstretched arm, a place in which it had for rivals an election placard and the point of my stick, fettered to the Square, inseparable from the head of the main street, powerless to hide from the gaze of the Café and of the omnibus office, receiving on its face half of that ray of the setting sun (half, presently, in a few hours’ time, of the light of the street lamp) of which the Bank building received the other half, tainted simultaneously with that branch office of a money-lending establishment by the smells from the pastry-cook’s oven, subjected to the tyranny of the Individual to such a point that, if I had chosen to scribble my name upon that stone, it was she, the illustrious Virgin whom until then I had endowed with a general existence and an intangible beauty, the Virgin of Balbec, the unique (which meant, alas, the only one) who, on her body coated with the same soot as defiled the neighbouring houses, would have displayed — powerless to rid herself of them — to all the admiring strangers come there to gaze upon her, the marks of my piece of chalk and the letters of my name; it was she, indeed, the immortal work of art, so long desired, whom I found, transformed, as was the church itself, into a little old woman in stone whose height I could measure and count her wrinkles. But time was passing; I must return to the station, where I was to wait for my grandmother and Françoise, so that we should all arrive at Balbec-Plage together. I reminded myself of what I had read about Balbec, of Swann’s saying: “It is exquisite; as fine as Siena.” And casting the blame for my disappointment upon various accidental causes, such as the state of my health, my exhaustion after the journey, my incapacity for looking at things properly, I endeavoured to console myself with the thought that other towns remained still intact for me, that I might soon, perhaps, be making my way, as into a shower of pearls, into the cool pattering sound that dripped from Quimperlé, cross that green water lit by a rosy glow in which Pont-Aven was bathed; but as for Balbec, no sooner had I set foot in it than it was as though I had broken open a name which ought to have been kept hermetically closed, and into which, seizing at once the opportunity that I had imprudently given them when I expelled all the images that had been living in it until then, a tramway, a Café, people crossing the square, the local branch of a Bank, irresistibly propelled by some external pressure, by a pneumatic force, had come crowding into the interior of those two syllables which, closing over them, let them now serve as a border to the porch of the Persian church, and would never henceforward cease to contain them

   In the little train of the local railway company which was to take us to Balbec-Plage I found my grandmother, but found her alone — for, imagining that she was sending Françoise on ahead of her, so as to have everything ready before we arrived, but having mixed up her instructions, she had succeeded only in packing off Françoise in the wrong direction, who at that moment was being carried down all unsuspectingly, at full speed, to Nantes, and would probably wake up next morning at Bordeaux. No sooner had I taken my seat in the carriage, filled with the fleeting light of sunset and with the lingering heat of the afternoon (the former enabling me, alas, to see written clearly upon my grandmother’s face how much the latter had tired her), than she began: “Well, and Balbec?” with a smile so brightly illuminated by her expectation of the great pleasure which she supposed me to have been enjoying that I dared not at once confess to her my disappointment. Besides, the impression which my mind had been seeking occupied it steadily less as the place drew nearer to which my body would have to become accustomed. At the end — still more than an hour away — of this journey I was trying to form a picture of the manager of the hotel at Balbec, to whom I, at that moment, did not exist, and I should have liked to be going to present myself to him in more impressive company than that of my grandmother, who would be certain to ask for a reduction of his terms. The only thing positive about him was his haughty condescension; his lineaments were still vague

   Every few minutes the little train brought us to a standstill in one of the stations which came before Balbec-Plage, stations the mere names of which (Incarville, Marcouville, Doville, Pont-a-Couleuvre, Arambouville, Saint-Mars-le-Vieux, Hermonville, Maineville) seemed to me outlandish, whereas if I had come upon them in a book I should at once have been struck by their affinity to the names of certain places in the neighbourhood of Combray. But to the trained ear two musical airs, consisting each of so many notes, several of which are common to them both, will present no similarity whatever if they differ in the colour of their harmony and orchestration. So it was that nothing could have reminded me less than these dreary names, made up of sand, of space too airy and empty and of salt, out of which the termination ‘ville’ always escaped, as the ‘fly’ seems to spring out from the end of the word ‘butterfly’— nothing could have reminded me less of those other names, Roussainville or Martinville, which, because I had heard them pronounced so often by my great-aunt at table, in the dining-room, had acquired a certain sombre charm in which were blended perhaps extracts of the flavour of ‘preserves,’ the smell of the fire of logs and of the pages of one of Bergotte’s books, the colour of the stony front of the house opposite, all of which things still to-day when they rise like a gaseous bubble from the depths of my memory preserve their own specific virtue through all the successive layers of rival interests which must be traversed before they reach the surface

   These were — commanding the distant sea from the crests of their several dunes or folding themselves already for the night beneath hills of a crude green colour and uncomfortable shape, like that of the sofa in one’s bedroom in an hotel at which one has just arrived, each composed of a cluster of villas whose line was extended to include a lawn-tennis court and now and then a casino, over which a flag would be snapping in the freshening breeze, like a hollow cough — a series of watering-places which now let me see for the first time their regular visitors, but let me see only the external features of those visitors — lawn-tennis players in white hats, the station-master spending all his life there on the spot among his tamarisks and roses, a lady in a straw ‘boater’ who, following the everyday routine of an existence which I should never know, was calling to her dog which had stopped to examine something in the road before going in to her bungalow where the lamp was already lighted for her return — which with these strangely usual and slightingly familiar sights stung my un-greeted eyes and stabbed my exiled heart. But how much were my sufferings increased when we had finally landed in the hall of the Grand Hotel at Balbec, and I stood there in front of the monumental staircase that looked like marble, while my grandmother, regardless of the growing hostility of the strangers among whom we should have to live, discussed ‘terms’ with the manager, a sort of nodding mandarin whose face and voice were alike covered with scars (left by the excision of countless pustules from one and from the other of the divers accents acquired from an alien ancestry and in a cosmopolitan upbringing) who stood there in a smart dinner-jacket, with the air of an expert psychologist, classifying, whenever the ‘omnibus’ discharged a fresh load, the ‘nobility and gentry’ as ‘geesers’ and the ‘hotel crooks’ as nobility and gentry. Forgetting, probably, that he himself was not drawing five hundred francs a month, he had a profound contempt for people to whom five hundred francs — or, as he preferred ta put it,‘twenty-five louis’ was ‘a lot of money,’ and regarded them as belonging to a race of pariahs for whom the Grand Hotel was certainly not intended. It is true that even within its walls there were people who did not pay very much and yet had not forfeited the manager’s esteem, provided that he was assured that they were watching their expenditure not from poverty so much as from avarice. For this could in no way lower their standing since it is a vice and may consequently be found at every grade of social position. Social position was the one thing by which the manager was impressed, social position, or rather the signs which seemed to him to imply that it was exalted, such as not taking one’s hat off when one came into the hall, wearing knickerbockers, or an overcoat with a waist, and taking a cigar with a band of purple and gold out of a crushed morocco case — to none of which advantages could I, alas, lay claim. He would also adorn his business conversation with choice expressions, to which, as a rule, he gave a wrong meaning

   While I heard my grandmother, who shewed no sign of annoyance at his listening to her with his hat on his head and whistling through his teeth at her, ask him in an artificial voice, “And what are . . . your charges? . . . Oh! far too high for my little budget,” waiting upon a bench, I sought refuge in the innermost depths of my own consciousness, strove to migrate to a plane of eternal thoughts — to leave nothing of myself, nothing that lived and felt on the surface of my body, anaesthetised as are those of animals which by inhibition feign death when they are attacked — so as not to suffer too keenly in this place, with which my total unfamiliarity was made all the more evident to me when I saw the familiarity that seemed at the same moment to be enjoyed by a smartly dressed lady for whom the manager shewed his respect by taking liberties with the little dog that followed her across the hall, the young ‘blood’ with a feather in his hat who asked, as he came in, ‘Any letters?’— all these people to whom it was an act of home-coming to mount those stairs of imitation marble. And at the same time the triple frown of Minos, ^Eacus and Rhadamanthus (beneath which I plunged my naked soul as into an unknown element where there was nothing now to protect it) was bent sternly upon me by a group of gentlemen who, though little versed perhaps in the art of receiving, yet bore the title ‘Reception Clerks,’ while beyond them again, through a closed wall of glass, were people sitting in a reading-room for the description of which I should have had to borrow from Dante alternately the colours in which he paints Paradise and Hell, according as I was thinking of the happiness of the elect who had the right to sit and read there undisturbed, or of the terror which my grandmother would have inspired in me if, in her insensibility to this sort of impression, she had asked me to go in there and wait for her by myself

   My sense of loneliness was further increased a moment later: when I had confessed to my grandmother that I did not feel well, that I thought that we should be obliged to return to Paris, she had offered no protest, saying merely that she was going out to buy a few things which would be equally useful whether we left or stayed (and which, I afterwards learned, were all for my benefit, Françoise having gone off with certain articles which I might need); while I waited for her I had taken a turn through the streets, packed with a crowd of people who imparted to them a sort of indoor warmth, streets in which were still open the hairdresser’s shop and the pastry-cook’s, the latter filled with customers eating ices, opposite the statue of Duguay-Trouin. This crowd gave me just about as much pleasure as a photograph of it in one of the ‘illustrateds’ might give a patient who was turning its pages in the surgeon’s waiting-room. I was astonished to find that there were people so different from myself that this stroll through the town had actually been recommended to me by the manager as a distraction, and also that the torture chamber which a new place of residence is could appear to some people a ‘continuous amusement,’ to quote the hotel prospectus, which might, it was true, exaggerate, but was, for all that, addressed to a whole army of clients to whose tastes it must appeal. True, it invoked, to make them come to the Grand Hotel, Balbec, not only the ‘exquisite fare’ and the ‘fairy-like view across the Casino gardens,’ but also the ‘ordinances of her Majesty Queen Fashion, which no one may break with impunity, or without being taken for a Boeotian, a charge that no well-bred man would willingly incur.’ The need that I now had of my grandmother was enhanced by my fear that I had shattered another of her illusions. She must be feeling discouraged, feeling that if I could not stand the fatigue of this journey there was no hope that any change of air could ever do me good. I decided to return to the hotel and to wait for her there: the manager himself came forward and pressed a button, and a person whose acquaintance I had not yet made, labelled ‘LIFT’ (who at that highest point in the building, which corresponded to the lantern in a Norman church, was installed like a photographer in his darkroom or an organist in his loft) came rushing down towards me with the agility of a squirrel, tamed, active, caged. Then, sliding upwards again along a steel pillar, he bore me aloft in his train towards the dome of this temple of Mammon. On each floor, on either side of a narrow communicating stair, opened out fanwise a range of shadowy galleries, along one of which, carrying a bolster, a chambermaid came past. I lent to her face, which the gathering dusk made featureless, the mask of my most impassioned dreams of beauty, but read in her eyes as they turned towards me the horror of my own nonentity. Meanwhile, to dissipate, in the course of this interminable assent, the mortal anguish which I felt in penetrating thus in silence the mystery of this chiaroscuro so devoid of poetry, lighted by a single vertical line of little windows which were those of the solitary water-closet on each landing, I addressed a few words to the young organist, artificer of my journey and my partner in captivity, who continued to manipulate the registers of his instrument and to finger the stops. I apologised for taking up so much room, for giving him so much trouble, and asked whether I was not obstructing him in the practice of an art to which, so as to flatter the performer, I did more than display curiosity, I confessed my strong attachment. But he vouchsafed no answer, whether from astonishment at my words, preoccupation with what he was doing, regard for convention, hardness of hearing, respect for holy ground, fear of danger, slowness of understanding, or by the manager’s orders

   There is perhaps nothing that gives us so strong an impression of the reality of the external world as the difference in the positions, relative to ourselves, of even a quite unimportant person before we have met him and after. I was the same man who had taken, that afternoon, the little train from Balbec to the coast, I carried in my body the same consciousness But on that consciousness, in the place where, at six o’clock, there had been, with the impossibility of forming any idea of the manager, the Grand Hotel or its occupants, a vague and timorous impatience for the moment at which I should reach my destination, were to be found now the pustules excised from the face of the cosmopolitan manager (he was, as a matter of fact, a naturalised Monégasque, although — as he himself put it, for he was always using expressions which he thought distinguished without noticing that they were incorrect —‘of Rumanian originality’), his action in ringing for the lift, the lift-boy himself, a whole frieze of puppet-show characters issuing from that Pandora’s box which was the Grand Hotel, undeniable, irremovable, and, like everything that is realised, sterilising. But at least this change, which I had done nothing to bring about, proved to me that something had happened which was external to myself — however devoid of interest that thing might be — and I was like a traveller who, having had the sun in his face when he started, concludes that he has been for so many hours on the road when he finds the sun behind him. I was half dead with exhaustion, I was burning with fever; I would gladly have gone to bed, but I had no night-things. I should have liked at least to lie down for a little while on the bed, but what good would that have done me, seeing that I should not have been able to find any rest there for that mass of sensations which is for each of us his sentient if not his material body, and that the unfamiliar objects which encircled that body, forcing it to set its perceptions on the permanent footing of a vigilant and defensive guard, would have kept my sight, my hearing, all my senses in a position as cramped and comfortless (even if I had stretched out my legs) as that of Cardinal La Balue in the cage in which he could neither stand nor sit. It is our noticing them that puts things in a room, our growing used to them that takes them away again and clears a space for us. Space there was none for me in my bedroom (mine in name only) at Balbec; it was full of things which did not know me, which flung back at me the distrustful look that I had cast at them, and, without taking any heed of my existence, shewed that I was interrupting the course of theirs. The clock — whereas at home I heard my clock tick only a few seconds in a week, when I was coming out of some profound meditation — continued without a moment’s interruption to utter, in an unknown tongue, a series of observations which must have been most uncomplimentary to myself, for the violet curtains listened to them without replying, but in an attitude such as people adopt who shrug their shoulders to indicate that the sight of a third person irritates them. They gave to this room with its lofty ceiling a semi-historical character which might have made it a suitable place for the assassination of the Duc de Guise, and afterwards for parties of tourists personally conducted by one of Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son’s guides, but for me to sleep in — no. I was tormented by the presence of some little bookcases with glass fronts which ran along the walls, but especially by a large mirror with feet which stood across one corner, for I felt that until it had left the room there would be no possibility of rest for me there. I kept raising my eyes — which the things in my room in Paris disturbed no more than did my eyelids themselves, for they were merely extensions of my organs, an enlargement of myself — towards the fantastically high ceiling of this belvedere planted upon the summit of the hotel which my grandmother had chosen for me; and in that region more intimate than those in which we see and hear, that region in which we test the quality of odours, almost in the very heart of my inmost self, the smell of flowering grasses next launched its offensive against my last feeble line of trenches, where I stood up to it, not without tiring myself still further, with the futile incessant defence of an anxious sniffing. Having no world, no room, no body now that was not menaced by the enemies thronging round me, invaded to the very bones by fever, I was utterly alone; I longed to die. Then my grandmother came in, and to the expansion of my ebbing heart there opened at once an infinity of space

   She was wearing a loose cambric gown which she put on at home whenever any of us was ill (because she felt more comfortable in it, she used to say, for she always ascribed to her actions a selfish motive), and which was, for tending us, for watching by our beds, her servant’s livery, her nurse’s uniform, her religious habit. But whereas the trouble that servants, nurses, religious take, their kindness to us, the merits that we discover in them and the gratitude that we owe them all go to increase the impression that we have of being, in their eyes, some one different, of feeling that we are alone, keeping in our own hands the control over our thoughts, our will to live, I knew, when I was with my grandmother, that, however great the misery that there was in me, it would be received by her with a pity still more vast; that everything that was mine, my cares, my wishes, would be, in my grandmother, supported upon a desire to save and prolong my life stronger than was my own; and my thoughts were continued in her without having to undergo any deflection, since they passed from my mind into hers without change of atmosphere or of personality. And — like a man who tries to fasten his necktie in front of a glass and forgets that the end which he sees reflected is not on the side to which he raises his hand, or like a dog that chases along the ground the dancing shadow of an insect in the air — misled by her appearance in the body as we are apt to be in this world where we have no direct perception of people’s souls, I threw myself into the arms of my grandmother and clung with my lips to her face as though I had access thus to that immense heart which she opened to me. And when I felt my mouth glued to her cheeks, to her brow, I drew from them something so beneficial, so nourishing that I lay in her arms as motionless, as solemn, as calmly gluttonous as a babe at the breast

   At last I let go, and lay and gazed, and could not tire of gazing at her large face, as clear in its outline as a fine cloud, glowing and serene, behind which I could discern the radiance of her tender love. And everything that received, in however slight a degree, any share of her sensations, everything that could be said to belong in any way to her was at once so spiritualised, so sanctified, that with outstretched hands I smoothed her dear hair, still hardly grey, with as much respect, precaution, comfort as if I had actually been touching her goodness. She found a similar pleasure in taking any trouble that saved me one, and in a moment of immobility and rest for my weary limbs something so delicious that when, having seen that she wished to help me with my undressing and to take my boots off, I made as though to stop her and began to undress myself, with an imploring gaze she arrested my hands as they fumbled with the top buttons of my coat and boots

    “Oh, do let me!” she begged. “It is such a joy for your Granny. And be sure you knock on the wall if you want anything in the night. My bed is just on the other side, and the partition is, quite thin. Just give a knock now, as soon as you are ready, so that we shall know where we are.”

   And, sure enough, that evening I gave three knocks — a signal which, the week after, when I was ill, I repeated every morning for several days, because my grandmother wanted me to have some milk early. Then, when I thought that I could hear her stirring, so that she should not be kept waiting but might, the moment she had brought me the milk, go to sleep again, I ventured on three little taps, timidly, faintly, but for all that distinctly, for if I was afraid of disturbing her, supposing that I had been mistaken and that she was still asleep, I should not have wished her either to lie awake listening for a summons which she had not at once caught and which I should not have the courage to repeat. And scarcely had I given my taps than I heard three others, in a different intonation from mine, stamped with a calm authority, repeated twice over so that there should be no mistake, and saying to me plainly: “Don’t get excited; I heard you; I shall be with you in a minute!” and shortly afterwards my grandmother appeared. I explained to her that I had been afraid that she would not hear me, or might think that it was some one in the room beyond who was lapping; at which she smiled:

    “Mistake my poor chick’s knocking for anyone else! Why, Granny could tell it among a thousand! Do you suppose there’s anyone else in the world who’s such a silly-billy, with such feverish little knuckles, so afraid of waking me up and of not making me understand? Even if he just gave the least scratch, Granny could tell her mouse’s sound at once, especially such a poor miserable little mouse as mine is. I could hear it just now, trying to make up its mind, and rustling the bedclothes, and going through all its tricks.”

   She pushed open the shutters; where a wing of the hotel jutted out at right angles to my window, the sun was already installed upon the roof, like a slater who is up betimes, and starts early and works quietly so as not to rouse the sleeping town, whose stillness seems to enhance his activity. She told me what o’clock, what sort of day it was; that it was not worth while my getting up and coming to the window, that there was a mist over the sea; if the baker’s shop had opened yet; what the vehicle was that I could hear passing. All that brief, trivial curtain-raiser, that negligible introit of a new day, performed without any spectator, a little scrap of life which was only for our two selves, which I should have no hesitation in repeating, later on, to Françoise or even to strangers, speaking of the fog ‘which you could have cut with a knife at six o’clock that morning, with the ostentation of one who was boasting not of a piece of knowledge that he had acquired but of a mark of affection shewn to himself alone; dear morning moment, opened like a symphony by the rhythmical dialogue of my three taps, to which the thin wall of my bedroom, steeped in love and joy, grown melodious, immaterial, singing like the angelic choir, responded with three other taps, eagerly awaited, repeated once and again, in which it contrived to waft to me the soul of my grandmother, whole and perfect, and the promise of her coming, with a swiftness of annunciation and melodic accuracy. But on this first night after our arrival, when my grandmqther had left me, I began again to feel as I had felt, the day before, in Paris, at the moment of leaving home. Perhaps this fear that I had — and shared with so many of my fellow-men — of sleeping in a strange room, perhaps this fear is only the most humble, obscure, organic, almost unconscious form of that great and desperate resistance set up by the things that constitute the better part of our present life towards our mentally assuming, by accepting it as true, the formula of a future in which those things are to have no part; a resistance which was at the root of the horror that I had so often been made to feel by the thought that my parents must, one day, die, that the stern necessity of life might qblige me to live remote from Gilberte, or simply to settle permanently in a place where I should never see any of my old friends; a resistance which was also at the root of the difficulty that I found in imagining my own death, or a survival such as Bergotte used to promise to mankind in his books, a survival in which I should not be allowed to take with me my memories, my frailties, my character, which did not easily resign themselves to the idea of ceasing to be, and desired for me neither annihilation nor an eternity in which they would have no part

   When Swann had said to me, in Paris one day when I felt particularly unwell: “You ought to go off to one of those glorious islands in the Pacific; you’d never come back again if you did.” I should have liked to answer: “But then I shall not see your daughter any more; I shall be living among people and things she has never seen.” And yet my better judgment whispered: “What difference can that make, since you are not going to be affected by it? When M. Swann tells you that you will not come back he means by that that you will not want to come back, and if you don’t want to that is because you will be happier out there.” For my judgment was aware that Habit — Habit which was even now setting to work to make me like this unfamiliar lodging, to change the position of the mirror, the shade of the curtains, to stop the clock — undertakes as well to make dear to us the companions whom at first we disliked, to give another appearance to their faces, to make attractive the sound of their voices, to modify the inclinations of their hearts. It is true that these new friendships for places and people are based upon forgetfulness of the old; but what my better judgment was thinking was simply that I could look without apprehension along the vista of a life in which I should be for ever separated from people all memory of whom I should lose, and it was by way of consolation that my mind was offering to my heart a promise of oblivion which succeeded only in sharpening the edge of its despair. Not that the heart also is not bound in time, when separation is complete, to feel the anodyne effect of habit; but until then it will continue to suffer. And our dread of a future in which we must forego the sight of faces, the sound of voices that we love, friends from whom we derive to-day our keenest joys, this dread, far from being dissipated, is intensified, if to the grief of such a privation we reflect that there will be added what seems to us now in anticipation an even more cruel grief; not to feel it as a grief at all — to remain indifferent; for if that should occur, our ego would have changed, it would then be not merely the attractiveness of our family, pur mistress, our friends that had ceased to environ us, but our affection for them; it would have been so completely eradicated from our heart, in which to-day it is a conspicuous element, that we should be able to enjoy that life apart from them the very thought of which to-day makes us recoil in horror; so that it would be in a real sense the death of ourselves, a death followed, it is true, by resurrection but in a different ego, the life, the love of which are beyond the reach of those elements of the existing ego that are doomed to die. It is they — even the meanest of them, such as our obscure attachments to the dimensions, to the atmosphere of a bedroom — that grow stubborn and refuse, in acts of rebellion which we must recognise to be a secret, partial, tangible and true aspect of our resistance to death, of the long resistance, desperate and daily renewed, to a fragmentary and gradual death such as interpolates itself throughout the whole course of our life, tearing away from us at every moment a shred of ourselves, dead matter on which new cells will multiply, and grow. And for a neurotic nature such as mine, one that is to say in which the intermediaries, the nerves, perform their functions badly — fail to arrest on its way to the consciousness, allow indeed to penetrate there, distinct, exhausting, innumerable, agonising, the plaint of those most humble elements of the personality which are about to disappear — the anxiety and alarm which I felt as I lay outstretched beneath that strange and too lofty ceiling were but the protest of an affection that survived in me for a ceiling that was familiar and low. Doubtless this affection too would disappear, and another have taken its place (when death, and then another life, would, in the guise of Habit, have performed their double task); but until its annihilation, every night it would suffer afresh, and on this first night especially, confronted with a future already realised in which there would no longer be any place for it, it rose in revolt, it tortured me with the sharp sound of its lamentations whenever my straining eyes, powerless to turn from what was wounding them, endeavoured to fasten their gaze upon that inaccessible ceiling

   But next morning! — after a servant had come to call me, and had brought me hot water, and while I was washing and dressing myself and trying in vain to find the things that I wanted in my trunk, from which I extracted, pell-mell, only a lot of things that were of no use whatever, what a joy it was to me, thinking already of the delights of luncheon and of a walk along the shore, to see in the window, and in all the glass fronts of the bookcases as in the portholes of a ship’s cabin, the open sea, naked, unshadowed, and yet with half of its expanse in shadow, bounded by a thin and fluctuant line, and to follow with my eyes the waves that came leaping towards me, one behind another, like divers along a springboard. Every other moment, holding in one hand the starched, unyielding towel, with the name of the hotel printed upon it, with which I was making futile efforts to dry myself, I returned to the window to gaze once more upon that vast amphitheatre, dazzling, mountainous, and upon the snowy crests of its emerald waves, here and there polished and translucent, which with a placid violence, a leonine bending of the brows, let their steep fronts, to which the sun now added a smile without face or features, run forward to their goal, totter and melt and be no more. Window in which I was, henceforward, to plant myself every morning, as at the pane of a mail coach in which one has slept, to see whether, in the night, a long sought mountain-chain has come nearer or withdrawn — only here it was those hills of the sea which, before they come dancing back towards us, are apt to retire so far that often it was only at the end of a long and sandy plain that I would distinguish, miles it seemed away, their first undulations upon a background transparent, vaporous, bluish, like the glaciers that one sees in the backgrounds of the Tuscan Primitives. On other mornings it was quite close at hand that the sun was smiling upon those waters of a green as tender as that preserved in Alpine pastures (among mountains on which the sun spreads himself here and there like a lazy giant who may at any moment come leaping gaily down their craggy sides) less by the moisture of their soil than by the liquid mobility of their light. Anyhow, in that breach which shore and water between them drive through all the rest of the world, for the passage, the accumulation there of light, it is light above all, according to the direction from which it comes and along which our eyes follow it, it is light that shifts and fixes the undulations of the sea. Difference of lighting modifies no less the orientation of a place, constructs no less before our eyes new goals which it inspires in us the yearning to attain, than would a distance in space actually traversed in the course of a long journey. When, in the morning, the sun came from behind the hotel, disclosing to me the sands bathed in light as far as the first bastions of the sea, it seemed to be shewing me another side of the picture, and to be engaging me in the pursuit, along the winding path of its rays, of a journey motionless but ever varied amid all the fairest scenes of the diversified landscape of the hours. And on this first morning the sun pointed out to me far off with a jovial finger those blue peaks of the sea, which bear no name upon any geographer’s chart, until, dizzy with its sublime excursion over the thundering and chaotic surface of their crests and avalanches, it came back to take shelter from the wind in my bedroom, swaggering across the unmade bed and scattering its riches over the splashed surface of the basin-stand, and into my open trunk, where by its very splendour and ill-matched luxury it added still further to the general effect of disorder. Alas, that wind from the sea; an hour later, in the great dining-room — while we were having our luncheon, and from the leathern gourd of a lemon were sprinkling a few golden drops on to a pair of soles which presently left on our plates the plumes of their picked skeletons, curled like stiff feathers and resonant as citherns — it seemed to my grandmother a cruel deprivation not to be able to feel its life-giving breath on her cheek, on account of the window, transparent but closed, which like the front of a glass case in a museum divided us from the beach while allowing us to look out upon its whole extent, and into which the sky entered so completely that its azure had the effect of being the colour of the windows and its white clouds only so many flaws in the glass. Imagining that I was ‘seated upon the mole’ or at rest in the ‘boudoir’ of which Baudelaire speaks I asked myself whether his ‘Sun’s rays upon the sea’ were not — a very different thing from the evening ray, simple and superficial as the wavering stroke of a golden pencil — just what at that moment was scorching the sea topaz-brown, fermenting it, turning it pale and milky like foaming beer, like milk, while now and then there hovered over it great blue shadows which some god seemed, for his pastime, to be shifting to and fro by moving a mirror in the sky. Unfortunately, it was not only in its outlook that it differed from our room at Combray, giving upon the houses over the way, this dining-room at Balbec, bare-walled, filled with a sunlight green as the water in a marble font, while a few feet away the full tide and broad daylight erected as though before the gates of the heavenly city an indestructible and moving rampart of emerald and gold. At Combray, since we were known to everyone, I took heed of no one. In life at the seaside one knows only one’s own party. I was not yet old enough, I was still too sensitive to have outgrown the desire to find favour in the sight of other people and to possess their hearts. Nor had I acquired the more noble indifference which a man of the world would have felt, with regard to the people who were eating their luncheon in the room, nor to the boys and girls who strolled past the window, with whom I was pained by the thought that I should never be allowed to go on expeditions, though not so much pained as if my grandmother, contemptuous of social formalities and concerned about nothing but my health, had gone to them with the request, humiliating for me to overhear, that they would consent to let me accompany them. Whether they were returning to some villa beyond my ken, or had emerged from it, racquet in hand, on their way to some lawn-tennis court, or were mounted on horses whose hooves trampled and tore my heart, I gazed at them with a passionate curiosity, in that blinding light of the beach by which social distinctions are altered, I followed all their movements through the transparency of that great bay of glass which allowed so much light to flood the room. But it intercepted the wind, and this seemed wrong to my grandmother, who, unable to endure the thought that I was losing the benefit of an hour in the open air, surreptitiously unlatched a pane and at once set flying, with the bills of fare, the newspapers, veils and hats of all the people at the other tables; she herself, fortified by the breath of heaven, remained calm and smiling like Saint Blandina, amid the torrent of invective which, increasing my sense of isolation and misery, those scornful, dishevelled, furious visitors combined to pour on us

   To a certain extent — and this, at Balbec, gave to the population, as a rule monotonously rich and cosmopolitan, of that sort of smart and ‘exclusive’ hotel, a quite distinctive local character — they were composed of eminent persons from the departmental capitals of that region of France, a chief magistrate from Caen, a leader of the Cherbourg bar, a big solicitor from Le Mans, who annually, when the holidays came round, starting from the various points over which, throughout the working year, they were scattered like snipers in a battle or draughtsmen upon a board, concentrated their forces upon this hotel. They always reserved the same rooms, and with their wives, who had pretensions to aristocracy, formed a little group, which was joined by a leading barrister and a leading doctor from Paris, who on the day of their departure would say to the others:

    “Oh, yes, of course; you don’t go by our train. You are fortunate, you will be home in time for luncheon.”

    “Fortunate, do you say? You, who live in the Capital, in ‘Paris, the great town,’ while I have to live in a wretched county town of a hundred thousand souls (it is true, we managed to muster a hundred and two thousand at the last census, but what is that compared to your two and a half millions?) going back, too, to asphalt streets and all the bustle and gaiety of Paris life?”

   They said this with a rustic burring of their r’s, but without bitterness, for they were leading lights each in his own province, who could like other people have gone to Paris had they chosen — the chief magistrate of Caen had several times been offered a judgeship in the Court of Appeal — but had preferred to stay where they were, from love of their native towns or of obscurity or of fame, or because they were reactionaries, and enjoyed being on friendly terms with the country houses of the neighbourhood. Besides several of them were not going back at once to their county towns

   For — inasmuch as the Bay of Balbec was a little world apart in the midst of a great world, a basketful of the seasons in which were clustered in a ring good days and bad, and the months in their order, so that not only, on days when one could make out Rivebelle, which was in itself a sign of coming storms, could one see the sunlight on the houses there while Balbec was plunged in darkness, but later on, when the cold weather had reached Balbec, one could be certain of finding on that opposite shore two or three supplementary months of warmth — those of the regular visitors to the Grand Hotel whose holidays began late or lasted long, gave orders, when rain and fog came and Autumn was in the air, for their boxes to be packed and embarked, and set sail across the Bay to find summer again at Rivebelle or Costedor. This little group in the Balbec hotel looked with distrust upon each new arrival, and while affecting to take not the least interest in him, hastened, all of them, to ply with questions their friend the head waiter. For it was the same head waiter — Aimé— who returned every year for the season, and kept their tables for them; and their good ladies, having heard that his wife was ‘expecting,’ would sit after meals working each at one of the ‘little things,’ stopping only to put up their glasses and stare at us, my grandmother and myself, because we were eating hard-boiled eggs in salad, which was considered common, and was, in fact, ‘not done’ in the best society of Alençon. They affected an attitude of contemptuous irony with regard to a Frenchman who was called ‘His Majesty’ and had indeed proclaimed himself King of a small island in the South Seas, inhabited by a few savages. He was staying in the hotel with his pretty mistress, whom, as she crossed the beach to bathe, the little boys would greet with “Three cheers for the Queen!” because she would reward them with a shower of small silver. The chief magistrate and the barrister went so far as to pretend not to see her, and if any of their friends happened to look at her, felt bound to warn him that she was only a little shop-girl

    “But I was told that at Ostend they used the royal bathing machine.”

    “Well, and why not? It’s on hire for twenty francs. You can take it yourself, if you care for that sort of thing. Anyhow, I know for a fact that the fellow asked for an audience, when he was there, with the King, who sent back word that he took no cognisance of any Pantomime Princes.” “Really, that’s interesting! What queer people there are in the world, to be sure!”

   And I dare say it was all quite true: but it was also from resentment of the thought that, to many of their fellow-visitors, they were themselves simply respectable but rather common people who did not know this King and Queen so prodigal with their small change, that the solicitor, the magistrate, the barrister, when what they were pleased to call the ‘Carnival’ went by, felt so much annoyance, and expressed aloud an indignation that was quite understood by their friend the head waiter who, obliged to shew proper civility to these generous if not authentic Sovereigns, still, while he took their orders, would dart from afar at his old patrons a covert but speaking glance. Perhaps there was also something of the same resentment at being erroneously supposed to be less and unable to explain that they were more smart, underlining the ‘fine specimen’ with which they qualified a young ‘blood,’ the consumptive and dissipated son of an industrial magnate, who appeared every day in a new suit of clothes with an orchid in his buttonhole, drank champagne at luncheon, and then strolled out of the hotel, pale, impassive, a smile of complete indifference on his lips, to the casino to throw away at the baccarat table enormous sums, ‘which he could ill afford to lose,’ as the solicitor said with a resigned air to the chief magistrate, whose wife had it ‘on good authority’ that this ‘detrimental’ young man was bringing his parents’ grey hair in sorrow to the grave

   On the other hand, the barrister and his friends could not exhaust their flow of sarcasm on the subject of a wealthy old lady of title, because she never moved anywhere without taking her whole household with her. Whenever the wives of the solicitor and the magistrate saw her in the dining-room at meal-times they put up their glasses and gave her an insolent scrutiny, as minute and distrustful as if she had been some dish with a pretentious name but a suspicious appearance which, after the negative result of a systematic study, must be sent away with a lofty wave of the hand and a grimace of disgust

   No doubt by this behaviour they meant only to shew that, if there were things in the world which they themselves lacked — in this instance, certain prerogatives which the old lady enjoyed, and the privilege of her acquaintance — it was not because they could not, but because they did not choose to acquire them. But they had succeeded in convincing themselves that this really was what they felt; and it was the suppression of all desire for, of all curiosity as to forms of life which were unfamiliar, of all hope of pleasing new people (for which, in the women, had been substituted a feigned contempt, an artificial brightness) that had the awkward result of obliging them to label their discontent satisfaction, and lie everlastingly to themselves, for which they were greatly to be pitied. But everyone else in the hotel was no doubt behaving in a similar fashion, though his behaviour might take a different form, and sacrificing, if not to self-importance, at any rate to certain inculcated principles and mental habits the thrilling delight of mixing in a strange kind of life. Of course, the atmosphere of the microcosm in which the old lady isolated herself was not poisoned with virulent bitterness, as was that of the group in which the wives of the solicitor and magistrate sat chattering with impotent rage. It was indeed embalmed with a delicate and old-world fragrance which, however, was none the less artificial. For at heart the old lady would probably have found in attracting, in attaching to herself (and, with that object, recreating herself), the mysterious sympathy of new friends a charm which is altogether lacking from the pleasure that is to be derived from mixing only with the people of one’s own world, and reminding oneself that, one’s own being the best of all possible worlds, the ill-informed contempt of ‘outsiders’ may be disregarded. Perhaps she felt that — were she to arriveincognito at the Grand Hotel, Balbec, she would, in her black stuff gown and old-fashioned bonnet, bring a smile to the lips of some old reprobate, who from the depths of his rocking chair would glance up and murmur, “What a scarecrow!” or, still worse, to those of some man of repute who bad, like the magistrate, kept between his pepper-and-salt whiskers a rosy complexion and a pair of sparkling eyes such as she liked to see, and would at once bring the magnifying lens of the conjugal glasses to bear upon so quaint a phenomenon; and perhaps it was in unconfessed dread of those first few minutes, which, though one knows that they will be but a few minutes, are none the less terrifying, like the first plunge of one’s head under water, that this old lady sent down in advance a servant, who would inform the hotel of the personality and habits of his mistress, and, cutting short the manager’s greetings, made, with an abruptness in which there was more timidity than pride, for her room, where her own curtains, substituted for those that draped the hotel windows, her own screens and photographs, set up so effectively between her and the outside world, to which otherwise she would have had to adapt herself, the barrier of her private life that it was her home (in which she had comfortably stayed) that travelled rather than herself

   Thenceforward, having placed between herself, on the one hand, and the staff of the hotel and its decorators on the other the servants who bore instead of her the shock of contact with all this strange humanity, and kept up around their mistress her familiar atmosphere, having set her prejudices between herself and the other visitors, indifferent whether or not she gave offence to people whom her friends would not have had in their houses, it was in her own world that she continued to live, by correspondence with her friends, by memories, by her intimate sense of and confidence in her own position, the quality of her manners, the competence of her politeness. And every day, when she came downstairs to go for a drive in her own carriage, the lady’s-maid who came after her carrying her wraps, the footman who preceded her, seemed like sentries who, at the gate of an embassy, flying the flag of the country to which she belonged, assured to her upon foreign soil the privilege of extra-territoriality. She did not leave her room until late in the afternoon on the day following our arrival, so that we did not see her in the dining-room, into which the manager, since we were strangers there, conducted us, taking us under his wing, as a corporal takes a squad of recruits to the master-tailor, to have them fitted; we did see however, a moment later, a country gentleman and his daughter, of an obscure but very ancient Breton family, M. and Mlle, de Stermaria, whose table had been allotted to us, in the belief that they had gone out and would not be back until the evening. Having come to Balbec only to see various country magnates whom they knew in that neighbourhood, they spent in the hotel dining-room, what with the invitations they accepted and the visits they paid, only such time as was strictly unavoidable. It was their stiffness that preserved them intact from all human sympathy, from interesting at all the strangers seated round about them, among whom M. de Stermaria kept up the glacial, preoccupied, distant, rude, punctilious and distrustful air that we assume in a railway refreshment-room, among fellow-passengers whom we have never seen before and will never see again, and with whom we can conceive of no other relations than to defend from their onslaught our ‘portion’ of cold chicken and our corner seat in the train. No sooner had we begun our luncheon than we were asked to leave the table, on the instructions of M. de Stermaria who had just arrived and, without the faintest attempt at an apology to us, requested the head waiter, in our hearing, to “see that such a mistake did not occur again,” for it was repugnant to him that “people whom he did not know” should have taken his table

   And certainly into the feeling which impelled a young actress (better known, though, for her smart clothes, her smart sayings, her collection of German porcelain, than in the occasional parts that she had played at the Odéon), her lover, an immensely rich young man for whose sake she had acquired her culture, and two sprigs of aristocracy at that time much in the public eye to form a little band apart, to travel only together, to come down to luncheon — when at Balbec — very late, after everyone had finished; to spend the whole day in their sitting-room playing cards, there entered no sort of ill-humour against the rest of us but simply the requirements of the taste that they had formed for a certain type of conversation, for certain refinements of good living, which made them find pleasure in spending their time, in taking their meals only by themselves, and would have rendered intolerable a life in common with people who had not been initiated into those mysteries. Even at a dinner or a card table, each of them had to be certain that, in the diner or partner who sat opposite to him, there was, latent and not yet made use of, a certain brand of knowledge which would enable him to identify the rubbish with which so many houses in Paris were littered as genuine mediaeval or renaissance ‘pieces’ and, whatever the subject of discussion, to apply the critical standards common to all their party whereby they distinguished good work from bad. Probably it was only — at such moments — by some infrequent, amusing interruption flung into the general silence of meal or game, or by the new and charming frock which the young actress had put on for luncheon or for poker, that the special kind of existence in which these four friends desired, above all things, to remain plunged was made apparent. But by engulfing them thus in a system of habits which they knew by heart it sufficed to protect them from the mystery of the life that was going on all round them. All the long afternoon, the sea was suspended there before their eyes only as a canvas of attractive colouring might hang on the wall of a wealthy bachelor’s flat and it was only in the intervals between the ‘hands’ that one of the players, finding nothing better to do, raised his eyes to it to seek from it some indication of the weather or the time, and to remind the others that tea was ready. And at night they did not dine in the hotel, where, hidden springs of electricity flooding the great dining-room with light, it became as it were an immense and wonderful aquarium against whose wall of glass the working population of Balbec, the fishermen and also the tradesmen’s families, clustering invisibly in the outer darkness, pressed their faces to watch, gently floating upon the golden eddies within, the luxurious life of its occupants, a thing as extraordinary to the poor as the life of strange fishes or molluscs (an important social question, this: whether the wall of glass will always protect the wonderful creatures at their feasting, whether the obscure folk who watch them hungrily out of the night will not break in some day to gather them from their aquarium and devour them). Meanwhile there may have been, perhaps, among the gazing crowd, a motionless, formless mass there in the dark, some writer, some student of human ichthyology who, as he watched the jaws of old feminine monstrosities close over a mouthful of food which they proceeded then to absorb, was amusing himself by classifying them according to their race, by their innate characteristics as well as by those acquired characteristics which bring it about that an old Serbian lady whose buccal protuberance is that of a great sea-fish, because from her earliest years she has moved in the fresh waters of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, eats her salad for all the world like a La Rochefoucauld

   At that hour one could see the three young men in dinner-jackets, waiting for the young woman, who was as usual late but presently, wearing a dress that was almost always different and one of a series of scarves, chosen to gratify some special instinct in her lover, after having from her landing rung for the lift, would emerge from it like a doll coming out of its box. And then all four, because they found that the international phenomenon of the ‘Palace,’ planted on Balbec soil, had blossomed there in material splendour rather than in food that was fit to eat, bundled into a carriage and went to dine, a mile off, in a little restaurant that was well spoken of, where they held with the cook himself endless discussions of the composition of their meal and the cooking of its various dishes. During their drive, the road bordered with apple-trees that led out of Balbec was no more to them than the distance that must be traversed — barely distinguishable in the darkness from that which separated their homes in Paris from the Café Anglais or the Tour d’Argent — before they could arrive at the fashionable little restaurant where, while the young man’s friends envied him because he had such a smartly dressed mistress, the latter’s scarves were spread about the little company like a fragrant, flowing veil, but one that kept it apart from the outer world

   Alas for my peace of mind, I had none of the detachment that all these people shewed. To many of them I gave constant thought; I should have liked not to pass unobserved by a man with a receding brow and eyes that dodged between the blinkers of his prejudices and his education, the great nobleman of the district, who was none other than the brother-in-law of Legrandin, and came every now and then to see somebody at Balbec and on Sundays, by reason of the weekly garden-party that his wife and he gave, robbed the hotel of a large number of its occupants, because one or two of them were invited to these entertainments and the others, so as not to appear to have been not invited, chose that day for an expedition to some distant spot. He had had, as it happened, an exceedingly bad reception at the hotel on the first day of the season, when the staff, freshly imported from the Riviera, did not yet know who or what he was. Not only was he not wearing white flannels, but, with old-fashioned French courtesy and in his ignorance of the ways of smart hotels, on coming into the hall in which there were ladies sitting, he had taken off his hat at the door, the effect of which had been that the manager did not so much as raise a finger to his own in acknowledgment, concluding that this must be some one of the most humble extraction, what he called ‘sprung from the ordinary.’ The solicitor’s wife, alone, had felt herself attracted by the stranger, who exhaled all the starched vulgarity of the really respectable, and had declared, with the unerring discernment and the indisputable authority of a person from whom the highest society of Le Mans held no secrets, that one could see at a glance that one was in the presence of a gentleman of great distinction, of perfect breeding, a striking contrast to the sort of people one usually saw at Balbec, whom she condemned as impossible to know so long as she did not know them. This favourable judgment which she had pronounced on Legrandin’s brother-in-law was based perhaps on the spiritless appearance of a man about whom there was nothing to intimidate anyone; perhaps also she had recognised in this gentleman farmer with the gait of a sacristan the Masonic signs of her own inveterate clericalism

   It made no difference my knowing that the young fellows who went past the hotel every day on horseback were the sons of the questionably solvent proprietor of a linen-drapery to whom my father would never have dreamed of speaking; the glamour of ‘seaside life’ exalted them in my eyes to equestrian statues of demi-gods, and the best thing that I could hope for was that they would never allow their proud gaze to fall upon the wretched boy who was myself, who left the hotel dining-room only to sit humbly upon the sands. I should have been glad to arouse some response even from the adventurer who had been king of a desert island in the South Seas, even of the young consumptive, of whom I liked to think that he was hiding beneath his insolent exterior a shy and tender heart, which would perhaps have lavished on me, and on me alone, the treasures of its affection. Besides (unlike what one generally says of the people one meets when travelling) just as being seen in certain company can invest us, in a watering-place to which we shall return another year, with a coefficient that has no equivalent in our true social life, so there is nothing — not which we keep so resolutely at a distance, but — which we cultivate with such assiduity after our return to Paris as the friendships that we have formed by the sea. I was anxious about the opinion that might be held of me by all these temporary or local celebrities whom my tendency to put myself in the place of other people and to reconstruct what was in their minds had made me place not in their true rank, that which they would have held in Paris, for instance, and which would have been quite low, but in that which they must imagine to be, and which indeed was their rank at Balbec, where the want of a common denominator gave them a sort of relative superiority and an individual interest. Alas, none of these people’s contempt for me was so unbearable as that of M. de Stermaria

   For I had noticed his daughter, the moment she came into the room, her pretty features, her pallid, almost blue complexion, what there was peculiar in the carriage of her tall figure, in her gait, which suggested to me — and rightly — her long descent, her aristocratic upbringing, all the more vividly because I knew her name, like those expressive themes composed by musicians of genius which paint in splendid colours the glow of fire, the rush of water, the peace of fields and woods, to audiences who, having first let thçir eyes run over the programme, have their imaginations trained in the right direction. The label ‘Centuries of Breeding,’ by adding to Mlle, de Stermaria’s charms the idea of their origin, made them more desirable also, advertising their rarity as a high price enhances the value of a thing that has already taken our fancy. And its stock of heredity gave to her complexion, in which so many selected juices had been blended, the savour of an exotic fruit or of a famous vintage

   And then mere chance put into our hands, my grandmother’s and mine, the means of giving ourselves an immediate distinction in the eyes of all the other occupants of the hotel. On that first afternoon, at the moment when the old lady came downstairs from her room, producing, thanks to the footman who preceded her, the maid who came running after her with a book and a rug that had been left behind, a marked effect upon all who beheld her and arousing in each of them a curiosity from which it was evident that none was so little immune as M. de Stermaria, the manager leaned across to my grandmother and, from pure kindness of heart (as one might point out the Shah, or Queen Ranavalo to an obscure onlooker who could obviously have no sort of connexion with so mighty a potentate, but might be interested, all the same, to know that he had been standing within a few feet of one) whispered in her ear, “The Marquise de Villeparisis!” while at the same moment the old lady, catching sight of my grandmother,-could not repress a start of pleased surprise

   It may be imagined that the sudden appearance, in the guise of a. little old woman, of the most powerful of fairies would not have given me so much pleasure, destitute as I was of any means of access to Mlle, de Stermaria, in a strange place where I knew no one: no one, that is to say, for any practical purpose. Aesthetically the number of types of humanity is so restricted that we must constantly, wherever we may be, have the pleasure of seeing people we know, even without looking for them in the works of the old masters, like Swann. Thus it happened that in the first few days of our visit to Balbec I had succeeded in finding Legrandin, Swann’s hall porter and Mme. Swann herself, transformed into a waiter, a foreign visitor whom I never saw again and a bathing superintendent. And a sort of magnetism attracts and retains so inseparably, one after another, certain characteristics, facial and mental, that when nature thus introduces a person into a new body she does not mutilate him unduly. Legrandin turned waiter kept intact his stature, the outline of his nose, part of his chin; Mme. Swann, in the masculine gender and the calling of a bathing superintendent, had been accompanied not only by familiar features, but even by the way she had of speaking. Only, she could be of little if any more use to me, standing upon the beach there in the red sash of her office, and hoisting at the first gust of wind the flag which forbade us to bathe (for these superintendents are prudent men, and seldom know how to swim) than she would have been in that fresco of the Life of Moses in which Swann had long ago identified her in the portrait of Jethro’s Daughter. Whereas this Mme. de Villeparisis was her real self, she had not been the victim of an enchantment which had deprived her of her power, but was capable, on the contrary, of putting at the service of my power an enchantment which would multiply it an hundredfold, and thanks to which, as though I had been swept through the air on the wings of a fabulous bird, I was to cross in a few moments the infinitely wide (at least, at Balbec) social gulf which separated me from Mlle, de Stermaria

   Unfortunately, if there was one person in the world who, more than anyone else, lived shut up in a little world of her own, it was my grandmother. She would not, indeed, have despised me, she would simply not have understood what I meant had she been told that I attached importance to the opinions, that I felt an interest in the persons of people the very existence of whom she had never noticed and would, when the time came to leave Balbec, retain no impression of their names. I dared not confess to her that if these same people had seen her talking to Mme. de Villeparisis, I should have been immensely gratified, because I felt that the Marquise counted for much in the hotel and that her friendship would have given us a position in the eyes of Mlle, de Stermaria. Not that my grandmother’s friend represented to me, in any sense of the word, a member of the aristocracy: I was too well used to her name, which had been familiar to my ears before my mind had begun to consider it, when as a child I had heard it occur in conversation at home: while her title added to it only a touch of quaintness — as some uncommon Christian name would have done, or as in the names of streets, among which we can see nothing more noble in the Rue Lord Byron, in the plebeian and even squalid Rue Rochechouart, or in the Rue Grammont than in the Rue Léonce Reynaud or the Rue Hyppolyte Lebas. Mme. de Villeparisis no more made me think of a person who belonged to a special world than did her cousin MacMahon, whom I did not clearly distinguish from M. Carnot, likewise President of the Republic, or from Raspail, whose photograph Françoise had bought with that of Pius IX. It was one of my grandmother’s principles that, when away from home, one should cease to have any social intercourse, that one did not go to the seaside to meet people, having plenty of time for that sort of thing in Paris, that they would make one waste on being merely polite, in pointless conversation, the precious time which ought all to be spent in the open air, beside the waves; and finding it convenient to assume that this view was shared by everyone else, and that it authorised, between old friends whom chance brought face to face in the same hotel, the fiction of a mutual incognito, on hearing her friend’s name from the manager she merely looked the other way, and pretended not to see Mme. de Villeparisis, who, realising that my grandmother did not want to be recognised, looked also into the void. She went past, and I was left in my isolation like a shipwrecked mariner who has seen a vessel apparently coming towards him which has then, without lowering a boat, vanished under the horizon

   She, too, had her meals in the dining-room, but at the other end of it. She knew none of the people who were staying in the hotel, or who came there to call, not even M. de Cambremer; in fact, I noticed that he gave her no greeting, one day when, with his wife, he had accepted an invitation to take luncheon with the barrister, who drunken with the honour of having the nobleman at his table avoided his friends of every day, and confined himself to a distant twitch of the eyelid, so as to draw their attention to this historic event but so discreetly that his signal could not be interpreted by them as an invitation to join the party

    “Well, I hope you’ve got on your best clothes; I hope you feel smart enough,” was the magistrate’s wife’s greeting to him that evening

    “Smart? Why should I?” asked the barrister, concealing his rapture in an exaggerated astonishment. “Because of my guests, do you mean?” he went on, feeling that it was impossible to keep up the farce any longer. “But what is there smart about having a few friends in to luncheon? After all, they must feed somewhere!”

    “But it is smart! They are the de Cambremers, aren’t they? I recognized them at once. She is a Marquise. And quite genuine, too. Not through the females.”

    “Oh, she’s a very simple soul, she is charming, no stand-offishness about her. I thought you were coming to join us. I was making signals to you . . . I would have introduced you!” he asserted, tempering with a hint of irony the vast generosity of the offer, like Ahasuerus when he says to Esther:

                           Of all my Kingdom must I give you half!

“No, no, no, no! We lie hidden, like the modest violet.”

    “But you were quite wrong, I assure you,” replied the barrister, growing bolder now that the danger point was passed. “They weren’t going to eat you. I say, aren’t we going to have our little game of bezique?”

    “Why, of course! We were afraid to suggest it, now that you go about entertaining Marquises.”

    “Oh, get along with you; there’s nothing so very wonderful about them, Why, I’m dining there to-morrow. Would you care to go instead of me? I mean it. Honestly, I’d just as soon stay here.”

    “No, no! I should be removed from the bench as a Reactionary,” cried the chief magistrate, laughing till the tears stood in his eyes at his own joke. “But you go to Féterne too, don’t you?” he went on, turning to the solicitor

    “Oh, I go there on Sundays — in at one door and out at the other. But I don’t have them here to luncheon, like the Leader.” M. de Stermaria was not at Balbec that day, to the barrister’s great regret. But he managed to say a word in season to the head waiter:

    “Aimé, you can tell M. de Stermaria that he’s not the only nobleman you’ve had in here. You saw the gentleman who was with me to-day at luncheon? Eh? A small moustache, looked like a military man. Well, that was the Marquis de Cambremer!”

    “Was it indeed? I’m not surprised to hear it.”

    “That will shew him that he’s not the only man who’s got a title. That will teach him! It’s not a bad thing to take ’em down a peg or two, those noblemen. I say, Aimé, don’t say anything to him unless you like: I mean to say, it’s no business of mine; besides, they know each other already.”

   And next day M. de Stermaria, who remembered that the barrister had once held a brief for one of his friends, came up and introduced himself

    “Our friends in common, the de Cambremers, were anxious that we should meet; the days didn’t fit; I don’t know quite what went wrong —” stammered the barrister, who, like most liars, imagined that other people do not take the trouble to investigate an unimportant detail which, for all that, may be sufficient (if chance puts you in possession of the humble facts of the case, and they contradict it) to shew the liar in his true colours and to inspire a lasting mistrust

   Then as at all times, but more easily now that her father had left her and was talking to the barrister, I was gazing at Mlle, de Stermaria. No less than the bold and always graceful originality of her attitudes, as when, leaning her elbows on the table, she raised her glass in both hands over her outstretched arms, the dry flame of a glance at once extinguished, the ingrained, congenital hardness that one could feel, ill-concealed by her own personal inflexions, in the sound of her voice, which had shocked my grandmother; a sort of atavistic starting point to which she recoiled whenever, by glance or utterance, she had succeeded in expressing a thought of her own; all of these qualities carried the mind of him who watched her back to the line of ancestors who had bequeathed to her that inadequacy of human sympathy, those blanks in her sensibility, that short measure of humanity which was at every moment running out. But from a certain look which flooded for a moment the wells — instantly dry again — of her eyes, a look in which I could discern that almost obsequious docility which the predominance of a taste for sensual pleasures gives to the proudest of women, who will soon come to recognise but one form of personal distinction, that namely which any man enjoys who can make her feel those pleasures, an actor, an acrobat even, for whom, perhaps, she will one day leave her husband; — from a certain rosy tint, warm and sensual, which flushed her pallid cheeks, like the colour that stained the hearts of the white water-lilies in the Vivonne, I thought I could discern that she would readily have consented to my coming to seek in her the savour of that life of poetry and romance which she led in Brittany, a life to which, whether from over-familiarity or from innate superiority, or from disgust at the penury or the avarice of her family, she seemed not to attach any great value, but which, for all that, she held enclosed in her body. In the meagre stock of will-power that had been transmitted to her, and gave an element of weakness to her expression, she would not perhaps have found the strength to resist. And, crowned by a feather that was a trifle old-fashioned and pretentious, the grey felt hat which she invariably wore at meals made her all the more attractive to me, not because it was in harmony with her pearly or rosy complexion, but because, by making me suppose her to be poor, it brought her closer to myself. Obliged by her father’s presence to adopt a conventional attitude, but already bringing to the perception and classification of the people who passed before her eyes other principles than his, perhaps she saw in me not my humble rank, but the right sex and age. If one day M. de Stermaria had gone out leaving her behind, if, above all, Mme. de Villeparisis, by coming to sit at our table, had given her an opinion of me which might have emboldened me to approach her, perhaps then we might have contrived to exchange a few words, to arrange a meeting, to form a closer tie. And for a whole month during which she would be left alone, without her parents, in her romantic Breton castle, we should perhaps have been able to wander by ourselves at evening, she and I together in the dusk which would shew in a softer light above the darkening water pink briar roses, beneath oak trees beaten and stunted by the hammering of the waves. Together we should have roamed that isle impregnated with so intense a charm for me because it had enclosed the everyday life of Mlle, de Stermaria and lay at rest in her remembering eyes. For it seemed to me that I should not really have possessed her save there, when I should have traversed those regions which enveloped her in so many memories — a veil which my desire sought to tear apart, one of those veils which nature interposes between woman and her pursuers (with the same intention as when, for all of us, she places the act of reproduction between ourselves and our keenest pleasure, and for insects, places before the nectar the pollen which they must carry away with them) in order that, tricked by the illusion of possessing her thus more completely, they may be forced to occupy first the scenes among which she lives, and which, of more service to their imagination than sensual pleasure can be, yet would not without that pleasure have had the power to attract them

   But I was obliged to take my eyes from Mlle, de Stermaria, for already, considering no doubt that making the acquaintance of an important person was a brief, inquisitive act which was sufficient in itself, and to bring out all the interest that was latent in it required only a handshake and a penetrating stare, without either immediate conversation or any subsequent relations, her father had taken leave of the barrister and returned to sit down facing her, rubbing his hands like a man who has just made a valuable acquisition. As for the barrister, once the first emotion of this interview had subsided, then, as on other days, he could be heard every minute addressing the head waiter:

    “But I am not a king, Aimé; go and attend to the king! I say, Chief, those little trout don’t look at all bad, do they? We must ask Aimé to let us have some. Aimé, that little fish you have over there looks to me highly commendable; will you bring us some, please, Aimé, and don’t be sparing with it?”

   He would repeat the name ‘Aimé’ all day long, one result of which was that when he had anyone to dinner the guest would remark “I can see, you are quite at home in this place,” and would feel himself obliged to keep, on saying ‘Aimé’ also, from that tendency, combining elements of timidity, vulgarity and silliness, which many people have, to believe that it is smart and witty to copy to the letter what is said by the company in which they may happen to be. The barrister repeated the name incessantly, but with a smile, for he felt that he was exhibiting at once the good terms on which he stood with the head waiter and his own superior station. And the head waiter, whenever he caught the sound of his own name, smiled too, as though touched and at the same time proud, shewing that he was conscious of the honour and could appreciate the pleasantry

   Terrifying as I always found these meals, in the vast restaurant, generally full, of the mammoth hotel, they became even more terrifying when there arrived for a few days the Proprietor (or he may have been only the General Manager, appointed by a board of directors) not only of this ‘palace’ but of seven or eight more besides, situated at all the four corners of France, in each of which, travelling continuously, he would spend a week now and again. Then, just after dinner had begun, there appeared every evening in the doorway of the dining-room this small man with white hair and a red nose, astonishingly neat and impassive, who was known, it appeared, as well in London as at Monte-Carlo, as one of the leading hotel-keepers in Europe. Once when I had gone out for a moment at the beginning of dinner, as I came in again I passed close by him, and he bowed to me, but with a coldness in which I could not distinguish whether it should be attributed to the reserve of a man who could never forget what he was, or to his contempt for a customer of so little importance. To those whose importance was considerable the Managing Director would bow, with quite as much coldness but more deeply, lowering his eyelids with a reverence that was almost offended modesty, as though he had found himself confronted, at a funeral, with the father of the deceased or with the Blessed Sacrament. Except for these icy and infrequent salutations, he made not the slightest movement, as if to show that his glittering eyes, which appeared to be starting out of his head, saw everything, controlled everything, assured to us in the ‘Hotel dinner’ perfection in every detail as well as a general harmony. He felt, evidently, that he was more than the producer of a play, than the conductor of an orchestra, nothing less than a general in supreme command. Having decided that a contemplation carried to its utmost intensity would suffice to assure him that everything was in readiness, that no mistake had been made which could lead to disaster — to invest him, in a word, with full responsibility, he abstained not merely from any gesture but even from moving his eyes, which, petrified by the intensity of their gaze, took in and directed everything that was going on. I felt that even the movements of my spoon did not escape him, and were he to vanish after the soup, for the whole of dinner the review that he had held would have taken away my appetite. His own was exceedingly good, as one could see at luncheon, which he took like an ordinary guest of the hotel at a table that anyone else might have had in the public dining-room. His table had this peculiarity only, that by his side, while he was eating, the other manager, the resident one, remained standing all the time to make conversation. For being subordinate to this Managing Director he was anxious to please a man of whom he lived in constant fear. My fear of him diminished during these luncheons, for being then lost in the crowd of visitors he would exercise the discretion of a general sitting in a restaurant where there are also private soldiers, in not seeming to take any notice of them. Nevertheless when the porter, from among a cluster of pages, announced to me: “He leaves to-morrow morning for Dinard. Then he’s going down to Biarritz, and after that to Cannes,” I began to breathe more freely

   My life in the hotel was rendered not only dull because I had no friends there but uncomfortable because Françoise had made so many. It might be thought that they would have made things easier for us in various respects. Quite the contrary. The proletariat, if they succeeded only with great difficulty in being treated as people she knew by Françoise, and could not succeed at all unless they fulfilled the condition of shewing the utmost politeness to her, were, on the other hand, once they had reached the position, the only people who ‘counted.’ Her time-honoured code taught her that she was in no way bound to the friends of her employers, that she might, if she was busy, shut the door without ceremony in the face of a lady who had come to call on my grandmother. But towards her own acquaintance, that is to say, the select handful of the lower orders whom she admitted to an unconquerable intimacy, her actions were regulated by the most subtle and most stringent of protocols. Thus Françoise having made the acquaintance of the man in the coffee-shop and of a little maid who did dressmaking for a Belgian lady, no longer came upstairs immediately after luncheon to get my grandmother’s things ready, but came an hour later, because the coffee man had wanted to make her a cup of coffee or a tisane in his shop, or the maid had invited her to go and watch her sew, and to refuse either of them would have been impossible, and one of the things that were not done. Moreover, particular attention was due to the little sewing-maid, who was an orphan and had been brought up by strangers to whom she still went occasionally for a few days’ holiday. Her unusual situation aroused Franchise’s pity, and also a benevolent contempt. She, who had a family, a little house that had come to her from her parents, with a field in which her brother kept his cows, how could she regard so uprooted a creature as her equal? And since this girl hoped, on Assumption Day, to be allowed to pay her benefactors a visit, Françoise kept on repeating: “She does make me laugh! She says, ‘I hope to be going home for the Assumption.’ ‘Home!’ says she! It isn’t just that it’s not her own place, they’re people who took her in from nowhere, and the creature says ‘home’ just as if it really was her home. Poor girl! What a wretched state she must be in, not to know what it is to have a home.” Still, if Françoise had associated only with the ladies’-maids brought to the hotel by other visitors, who fed with her in the ‘service’ quarters and, seeing her grand lace cap and her handsome profile, took her perhaps for some lady of noble birth, whom ‘reduced circumstances,’ or a personal attachment had driven to serve as companion to my grandmother, if in a word Françoise had known only people who did not belong to the hotel, no great harm would have been done, since she could not have prevented them from doing us any service, for the simple reason that in no circumstances, even without her knowledge, would it have been possible for them to serve us at all. But she had formed connexions also with one of the wine waiters, with a man in the kitchen, and with the head chambermaid of our landing. And the result of this in our everyday life was that Françoise, who on the day of her arrival, when she still did not know anypne, would set all the bells jangling for the slightest thing, at an hour when my grandmother and I would never have dared to ring, and if we offered some gentle admonition answered: “Well, we’re paying enough for it, aren’t we?” as though it were she herself that would have to pay; nowadays, since she had made friends with a personage in the kitchen, which had appeared to us to augur well for our future comfort, were my grandmother or I to complain of cold feet, Françoise, even at an hour that was quite normal, dared not ring; she assured us that it would give offence because they would have to light the furnace again, or because it would interrupt the servants’ dinner and they would be annoyed. And she ended with a formula that, in spite of the ambiguous way in which she uttered it, was none the less clear, and put us plainly in the wrong: “The fact is . . . ” We did not insist, for fear of bringing upon ourselves another, far more serious: “It’s a matter . . .!” So that it amounted to this, that we could no longer have any hot water because Françoise had become a friend of the man who would have to heat it

   In the end we too formed a connexion, in spite of but through my grandmother, for she and Mme. de Villeparisis came in collision one morning in a doorway and were obliged to accost each other, not without having first exchanged gestures of surprise and hesitation, performed movements of recoil and uncertainty, and finally uttered protestations of joy and greeting, as in some of Molière’s plays, where two actors who have been delivering long soliloquies from opposite sides of the stage, a few feet apart, are supposed not to have seen each other yet, and then suddenly catch sight of each other, cannot believe their eyes, break off what they are saying and finally address each other (the chorus having meanwhile kept the dialogue going) and fall into each other’s arms. Mme. de Villeparisis was tactful, and made as if to leave my grandmother to herself after the first greetings, but my grandmother insisted on her staying to talk to her until luncheon, being anxious to discover how her friend managed to get her letters sent up to her earlier than we got ours, and to get such nice grilled things (for Mme. de Villeparisis, a great epicure, had the poorest opinion of the hotel kitchen which served us with meals that my grandmother, still quoting Mme. de Sévigné, described as “of a magnificence to make you die of hunger.”) And the Marquise formed the habit of coming every day, until her own meal was ready, to sit down for a moment at our table in the dining-room, insisting that we should not rise from our chairs or in any way put ourselves out. At the most we would linger, as often as not, in the room after finishing our luncheon, to talk to her, at that sordid moment when the knives are left littering the tablecloth among crumpled napkins. For my own part, so as to preserve (in order that I might be able to enjoy Balbec) the idea that I was on the uttermost promontory of the earth, I compelled myself to look farther afield, to notice only the sea, to seek in it the effects described by Baudelaire and to let my gaze fall upon our table only on days when there was set on it some gigantic fish, some marine monster, which unlike the knives and forks was contemporary with the primitive epochs in which the Ocean first began to teem with life, in the Cimmerians’ time, a fish whose body with its numberless vertebrae, its blue veins and red, had been constructed by nature, but according to an architectural plan, like a polychrome cathedral of the deep

   As a barber, seeing an officer whom he is accustomed to shave with special deference and care recognise a customer who has just entered the shop and stop for a moment to talk to him, rejoices in the thought that these are two men of the same social order, and cannot help smiling as he goes to fetch the bowl of soap, for he knows that in his establishment,’ to the vulgar routine of a mere barber’s-shop, are being added social, not to say aristocratic pleasures, so Aimé, seeing that Mme. de Villeparisis had found in us old friends, went to fetch our finger-bowls with precisely the smile, proudly modest and knowingly discreet, of a hostess who knows when to leave her guests to themselves. He suggested also a pleased and loving father who looks on, without interfering, at the happy pair who have plighted their troth at his hospitable board. Besides, it was enough merely to utter the name of a person of title for Aimé to appear pleased, unlike Françoise, before whom you could not mention Count So-and-so without her face darkening and her speech becoming dry and sharp, all of which meant that she worshipped the aristocracy not less than Aimé but far more. But then Françoise had that quality which in others she condemned as the worst possible fault; she was proud. She was not of that friendly and good-humoured race to which Aimé belonged. They feel, they exhibit an intense delight when you tell them a piece of news which may be more or less sensational but is at any rate new, and not to be found in the papers. Françoise declined to appear surprised. You might have announced in her hearing that the Archduke Rudolf — not that she had the least suspicion of his having ever existed — was not, as was generally supposed, dead, but ‘alive and kicking’; she would have answered only ‘Yes,’ as though she had known it all the time. It may, however, have been that if even from our own lips, from us whom she so meekly called her masters, who had so nearly succeeded in taming her, she could not, without having to check an angry start, hear the name of a noble, that was because the family from which she had sprung occupied in its own village a comfortable and independent position, and was not to be threatened in the consideration which it enjoyed save by those same nobles, in whose households, meanwhile, from his boyhood, an Aimé would have been domiciled as a servant, if not actually brought up by their charity. Of Françoise, then, Mme. de Villeparisis must ask pardon, first, for her nobility. But (in France, at any rate) that is precisely the talent, in fact the sole occupation of our great gentlemen and ladies. Françoise, following the common tendency of servants, who pick up incessantly from the conversation of their masters with other people fragmentary observations from which they are apt to draw erroneous inductions, as the human race generally does with respect to the habits of animals, was constantly discovering that somebody had ‘failed’ us, a conclusion to which she was easily led, not so much, perhaps, by her extravagant love for us, as by the delight that she took in being disagreeable to us. But having once established, without possibility of error, the endless little attentions paid to us, and paid to herself also by Mme. de Villeparisis, Françoise forgave her for being a Marquise, and, as she had never ceased to be proud of her because she was one, preferred her thenceforward to all our other friends. It must be added that no one else took the trouble to be so continually nice to us. Whenever my grandmother remarked on a book that Mme. de Villeparisis was reading, or said she had been admiring the fruit which some one had just sent to our friend, within an hour the footman would come to our rooms with book or fruit. And the next time we saw her, in response to our thanks, she would say only, seeming to seek some excuse for the meagreness of her present in some special use to which it might be put: “It’s nothing wonderful, but the newspapers come so late here, one must have something to read.” Or, “It is always wiser to have fruit one can be quite certain of, at the seaside.”—“But I don’t believe I’ve ever seen you eating oysters,” she said to us, increasing the sense of disgust which I felt at that moment, for the living flesh of the oyster revolted me even more than the gumminess of the stranded jellyfish defiled for me the beach at Balbec; “they are delicious down here! Oh, let me tell my maid to fetch your letters when she goes for mine. What, your daughter writes every day? But what on earth can you find to say to each other?” My grandmother was silent, but it may be assumed that her silence was due to scorn, in her who used to repeat, when she wrote to Mamma, the words of Mme. de Sévigné: “As soon as I have received a letter, I want another at once; I cannot breathe until it comes. There are few who are worthy to understand what I mean.” And I was afraid of her applying to Mme. de Villeparisis the conclusion: “I seek out those who are of the chosen few, and I avoid the rest.” She fell back upon praise of the fruit which Mme. de Villeparisis had sent us the day before. And this had been, indeed, so fine that the manager, in spite of the jealousy aroused by our neglect of his official offerings, had said to me: “I am like you; I’m madder about fruit than any other kind of dessert.” My grandmother told her friend that she had enjoyed them all the more because the fruit which we got in the hotel was generally horrid. “I cannot,” she went on, “say, like Mme. de Sévigné, that if we should take a sudden fancy for bad fruit we should be obliged to order it from Paris.” “Oh yes, of course, you read Mme. de Sévigné. I saw you with her letters the day you came.” (She forgot that she had never officially seen my grandmother in the hotel until their collision in the doorway.) “Don’t you find it rather exaggerated, her constant anxiety about her daughter? She refers to it too often to be really sincere. She is not natural.” My grandmother felt that any discussion would be futile, and so as not to be obliged to speak of the things she loved to a person incapable of understanding them, concealed by laying her bag upon them the Mémoires de Mme. de Beausergent

   Were she to encounter Françoise at the moment (which Françoise called ‘the noon’) when, wearing her fine cap and surrounded with every mark of respect, she was coming downstairs to ‘feed with the service,’ Mme. Villeparisis would stop her to ask after us. And Françoise, when transmitting to us the Marquise’s message: “She said to me, ‘You’ll be sure and bid them good day,’ she said,” counterfeited the voice of Mme. de Villeparisis, whose exact words she imagined herself to be quoting textu-ally, whereas she was really corrupting them no less than Plato corrupts the words of Socrates or Saint John the words of Jesus. Françoise, as was natural, was deeply touched by these attentions. Only she did not believe my grandmother, but supposed that she must be lying in the interest of her class (the rich always combining thus to support one another) when she assured us that Mme. de Villeparisis had been lovely as a young woman. It was true that of this loveliness only the faintest trace remained, from which no one — unless he happened to be a great deal more of an artist than Françoise — would have been able to restore her ruined beauty. For in order to understand how beautiful an elderly woman can once have been one must not only study but interpret every line of her face

    “I must remember, some time, to ask her whether I’m not right, after all, in thinking that there is some connexion with the Guermantes,” said my grandmother, to my great indignation. How could I be expected to believe in a common origin uniting two names which had entered my consciousness, one through the low and shameful gate of experience, the other by the golden gate of imagination?

   We had several times, in the last few days, seen driving past us in a stately equipage, tall, auburn, handsome, with a rather prominent nose, the Princesse de Luxembourg, who was staying in the neighbourhood for a few weeks. Her carriage had stopped outside the hotel, a footman had come in and spoken to the manager, had gone back to the carriage and had reappeared with the most amazing armful of fruit (which combined in a single basket, like the bay itself, different seasons) with a card: “La Princesse de Luxembourg,” on which were scrawled a few words in pencil. For what princely traveller sojourning here incognito, could they be intended, those glaucous plums, luminous and spherical as was at that moment the circumfluent sea, transparent grapes clustering on a shrivelled stick, like a fine day in autumn, pears of a heavenly ultramarine? For it could not be on my grandmother’s friend that the Princess had meant to pay a call. And yet on the following evening Mme. de Villeparisis sent us the bunch of grapes, cool, liquid, golden; plums too and pears which we remembered, though the plums had changed, like the sea at our dinner-hour, to a dull purple, and on the ultramarine surface of the pears there floated the forms of a few rosy clouds. A few days later we met Mme. de Villeparisis as we came away from the symphony concert that was given every morning on the beach. Convinced that the music to which I had been listening (the Prelude to Lohengrin, the Overture to Tannhäuser and suchlike) expressed the loftiest of truths, I was trying to elevate myself, as far as I could, so as to attain to a comprehension of them, I was extracting from myself so as to understand them, and was attributing to them, all that was best and most profound in my own nature at that time

   Well, as we came out of the concert, and, on our way back to the hotel, had stopped for a moment on the ‘front,’ my grandmother and I, for a few words with Mme. de Villeparisis who told us that she had ordered somecroque-monsieurs and a dish of creamed eggs for us at the hotel, I saw, a long way away, coming in our direction, the Princesse de Luxembourg, half leaning upon a parasol in such a way as to impart to her tall and wonderful form that slight inclination, to make it trace that arabesque dear to the women who had been beautiful under the Empire, and knew how, with drooping shoulders, arched backs, concave hips and bent limbs, to make their bodies float as gently as a silken scarf about the rigidity of the invisible stem which might be supposed to have been passed diagonally through them. She went out every morning for a turn on the beach almost at the time when everyone else, after bathing, was climbing home to luncheon, and as hers was not until half past one she did not return to her villa until long after the hungry bathers had left the scorching ‘front’ a desert. Mme. de Villeparisis presented my grandmother and would have presented me, but had first to ask me my name, which she could not remember. She had, perhaps, never known it, or if she had must have forgotten years ago to whom my grandmother had married her daughter. My name, when she did hear it, appeared to impress Mme. de Villeparisis considerably. Meanwhile the Princesse de Luxembourg had given us her hand and, now and again, while she conversed with the Marquise, turned to bestow a kindly glance on my grandmother and myself, with that embryonic kiss which we put into our smiles when they are addressed to a baby out with its ‘Nana.’ Indeed, in her anxiety not to appear to be a denizen of a higher sphere than ours, she had probably miscalculated the distance there was indeed between us, for by an error in adjustment she made her eyes beam with such benevolence that I could see the moment approaching when she would put out her hand and stroke us, as if we were two nice beasts and had poked our heads out at her through the bars of our cage in the Gardens. And, immediately, as it happened, this idea of caged animals and the Bois de Boulogne received striking confirmation. It was the time of day at which the beach is crowded by itinerant and clamorous vendors, hawking cakes and sweets and biscuits. Not knowing quite what to do to shew her affection for us, the Princess hailed the next that came by; he had nothing left but one rye-cake, of the kind one throws to the ducks. The Princess took it and said to me: “For your grandmother.” And yet it was to me that she held it out, saying with a friendly smile, “You shall give it to her yourself!” thinking that my pleasure would thus be more complete if there were no intermediary between myself and the animals. Other vendors came up; she stuffed my pockets with everything that they had, tied up in packets, comfits, sponge-cakes, sugar-sticks. “You will eat some yourself,” she told me, “and give some to your grandmother,” and she had the vendors paid by the little Negro page, dressed in red satin, who followed her everywhere and was a nine days’ wonder upon the beach. Then she said good-bye to Mme. de Villeparisis and held out her hand to us with the intention of treating us in the same way as she treated her friend, as people whom she knew, and of bringing herself within our reach. But this time she must have reckoned our level as not quite so low in the scale of creation, for her and our equality was indicated by the Princess to my grandmother by that tender and maternal smile which a woman gives a little boy when she says good-bye to him as though to a grown-up person. By a miraculous stride in evolution, my grandmother was no longer a duck or an antelope, but had already become what the anglophil Mme. Swann would have called a ‘baby.’ Finally, having taken leave of us all, the Princess resumed her stroll along the basking ‘front,’ curving her splendid shape which, like a serpent coiled about a wand, was interlaced with the white parasol patterned in blue which Mme. de Luxembourg held, unopened, in her hand. She was my first Royalty — I say my first, for strictly speaking Princesse Mathilde did not count. The second, as we shall see in due course, was to astonish me no less by her indulgence. One of the ways in which our great nobles, kindly intermediaries between commoners and kings, can befriend us was revealed to me next day when Mme. de Villeparisis reported: “She thought you quite charming. She is a woman of the soundest judgment, the warmest heart. Not like so many Queens and people! She has real merit.” And Mme. de Villeparisis went on in a tone of conviction, and quite thrilled to be able to say it to us: “I am sure she would be delighted to see you again.”

   But on that previous morning, after we had parted from the Princesse de Luxembourg, Mme. de Villeparisis said a thing which impressed me far more and was not prompted merely by friendly feeling

    “Are you,” she had asked me, “the son of the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry? Indeed! I am told your father is a most charming man. He is having a splendid holiday just now.”

   A few days earlier we had heard, in a letter from Mamma, that my father and his friend M. de Norpois had lost their luggage

    “It has been found; as a matter of fact, it was never really lost, I can tell you what happened,” explained Mme. de Villeparisis, who, without our knowing how, seemed to be far better informed than ourselves of the course of my father’s travels. “I think your father is now planning to come home earlier, next week, in fact, as he will probably give up the idea of going to Algeciras. But he is anxious to devote a day longer to Toledo; it seems, he is an admirer of a pupil of Titian — I forget the name — whose work can only be seen properly there.”

   I asked myself by what strange accident, in the impartial glass through which Mme. de Villeparisis considered, from a safe distance, the bustling, tiny, purposeless agitation of the crowd of people whom she knew, there had come to be inserted at the spot through which she observed rhy father a fragment of prodigious magnifying power which made her see in such high relief and in the fullest detail everything that there was attractive about him, the contingencies that were obliging him to return home, his difficulties with the customs, his admiration for El Greco, and, altering the scale of her vision, shewed her this one man so large among all the rest quite small, like that Jupiter to whom Gustave Moreau gave, when he portrayed him by the side of a weak mortal, a superhuman stature

   My grandmother bade Mme. de Villeparisis good-bye, so that we might stay and imbibe the fresh air for a little while longer outside the hotel, until they signalled to us through the glazed partition that our luncheon was ready. There were sounds of tumult. The young mistress of the King of the Cannibal Island had been down to bathe and was now coming back to the hotel

    “Really and truly, it’s a perfect plague: it’s enough to make one decide to emigrate!” cried the barrister, who had happened to cross her path, in a towering rage

   Meanwhile the solicitor’s wife was following the bogus Queen with eyes that seemed ready to start from their sockets

    “I can’t tell you how angry Mme. Blandais makes me when she stares at those people like that,” said the barrister to the chief magistrate, “I feel I want to slap her. That is just the way to make the wretches appear important; and of course that’s the very thing they want, that people should take an interest in them. Do ask her husband to tell her what a fool she’s making of herself. I swear I won’t go out with them again if they stop and gape at those masqueraders.”

   As to the coming of the Princesse de Luxembourg, whose carriage, on the day on which she left the fruit, had drawn up outside the hotel, it had not passed unobserved by the little group of wives, the solicitor’s, the barrister’s and the magistrate’s, who had for some time past been most concerned to know whether she was a genuine Marquise and not an adventuress, that Mme. de Villeparisis whom everyone treated with so much respect, which all these ladies were burning to hear that she did not deserve. Whenever Mme. de Villeparisis passed through the hall the chief magistrate’s wife, who scented irregularities everywhere, would raise her eyes from her ‘work’ and stare at the intruder in a way that made her friends die of laughter

    “Oh, well, you know,” she explained with lofty condescension, “I always begin by believing the worst. I will never admit that a woman is properly married until she has shewn me her birth certificate and her marriage lines. But there’s no need to alarm yourselves; just wait till I’ve finished my little investigation.”

   And so, day after day the ladies would come together, and, laughingly, ask one another: “Any news?”

   But on the evening after the Princesse de Luxembourg’s call the magistrate’s wife laid a finger on her lips

    “I’ve discovered something.”

    “Oh, isn’t Mme. Poncin simply wonderful? I never saw anyone. . . . But do tell us! What has happened?”

    “Just listen to this. A woman with yellow hair and six inches of paint on her face and a carriage like a — you could smell it a mile off; which only a creature like that would dare to have — came here to-day to call on the Marquise, by way of!”

    “Oh-yow-yow! Tut-tut-tut-tut. Did you ever! Why, it must be that woman we saw — you remember, Leader — we said at the time we didn’t at all like the look of her, but we didn’t know that it was the ‘Marquise’ sheîd come to see. A woman with a nigga-boy, you mean?”

    “That’s the one.”

    “D’you mean to say so? You don’t happen to know her name?”

    “Yes, I made a mistake on purpose; I picked up her card; she tradesunder the name of the ‘Princesse de Luxembourg!’ Wasn’t I right to have my doubts about her? It’s a nice thing to have to mix promiscuously with a Baronne d’Ange like that?” The barrister quoted Mathurin Régnier’sMacette to the chief magistrate

   It must not, however, be supposed that this misunderstanding was merely temporary, like those that occur in the second act of a farce to be cleared up before the final curtain. Mme. de Luxembourg, a niece of the King of England and of the Emperor of Austria, and Mme. de Villeparisis, when one called to take the other for a drive, did look like nothing but two ‘old trots’ of the kind one has always such difficulty in avoiding at a watering place. Nine tenths of the men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain appear to the average man of the middle class simply as alcoholic wasters (which, individually, they not infrequently are) whom, therefore, no respectable person would dream of asking to dinner. The middle class fixes its standard, in this respect, too high, for the feelings of these men would never prevent their being received with every mark of esteem in houses which it, the middle class, may never enter. And so sincerely do they believe that the middle class knows this that they affect a simplicity in speaking of their own affairs and a tone of disparagement of their friends, especially when they are ‘at the coast,’ which make the misunderstanding complete. If, by any chance, a man of the fashionable world is kept in touch with ‘business people’ because, having more money than he knows what to do with, he finds himself elected chairman of all sorts of important financial concerns, the business man who at last sees a nobleman worthy, he considers, to rank with ‘big business,’ would take his oath that such a man can have no dealings with the Marquis ruined by gambling whom the said business man supposes to be all the more destitute of friends the more friendly he makes himself. And he cannot get over his surprise when the Duke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the colossal undertaking, arranges a marriage for his son with the daughter of that very Marquis, who may be a gambler but who bears the oldest name in France, just as a Sovereign would sooner see his son marry the daughter of a dethroned King than that of a President still in office. That is to say, the two worlds take as fantastic! a view of one another as the inhabitants of a town situated at one end of Balbec Bay have of the town at the other end: from Rivebelle you can just see Marcouville l’Orgueilleuse; but even that is deceptive, for you imagine that you are seen from Marcouville, where, as a matter of fact, the splendours of Rive-belle are almost wholly invisible

   The Balbec doctor, who had been called in to cope with a sudden feverish attack, having given the opinion that I ought not to stay out all day on the beach, in the blazing sun, without shelter, and having written out various prescriptions for my use, my grandmother took his prescriptions with a show of respect in which I could at once discern her firm resolve not to have any of them ‘made up,’ but did pay attention to his advice on the matter of hygiene, and accepted an offer from Mme. de Villeparisis to take us for drives in her carriage. After this I would spend the mornings, until luncheon, going to and fro between my own room and my grandmother’s. Hers did not look out directly upon the sea, as mine did, but was lighted from three of its four sides — with views of a strip of the ‘front,’ of a well inside the building, and of the country inland, and was furnished differently from mine, with armchairs upholstered in a metallic tissue with red flowers from which seemed to emanate the cool and pleasant odour that greeted me when I entered the room. And at that hour when the sun’s rays, coming from different aspects and, as it were, from different hours of the day, broke the angles of the wall, thrust in a reflexion of the beach, made of the chest of drawers a festal altar, variegated as a bank of field-flowers, attached to the wall the wings, folded, quivering, warm, of a radiance that would, at any moment, resume its flight, warmed like a bath a square of provincial carpet before the window overlooking the well, which the sun festooned and patterned like a climbing vine, added to the charm and complexity of the room’s furniture by seeming to pluck and scatter the petals of the silken flowers on the chairs, and to make their silver threads stand out from the fabric, this room in which I lingered for a moment before going to get ready for our drive suggested a prism in which the colours of the light that shone outside were broken up, or a hive in which the sweet juices of the day which I was about to taste were distilled, scattered, intoxicating, visible, a garden of hope which dissolved in a quivering haze of silver threads and rose leaves. But before all this I had drawn back my own curtains, impatient to know what Sea it was that was playing that morning by the shore, like a Nereid. For none of those Seas ever stayed with us longer than a day. On the morrow there would be another, which sometimes resembled its predecessor. But I never saw the same one twice

   There were some that were of so rare a beauty that my pleasure on catching sight of them was enhanced by surprise. By what privilege, on one morning rather than another, did the window on being uncurtained disclose to my wondering eyes the nymph Glauconome, whose lazy beauty, gently breathing, had the transparence of a vaporous emerald beneath whose surface I could see teeming the ponderable elements that coloured it? She made the sun join in her play, with a smile rendered languorous by an invisible haze which was nought but a space kept vacant about her translucent surface, which, thus curtailed, became more appealing, like those goddesses whom the sculptor carves in relief upon a block of marble, the rest of which he leaves unchiselled. So, in her matchless colour, she invited us out over those rough terrestrial roads, from which, seated beside Mme. de Villeparisis in her barouche, we should see, all day long and without ever reaching it, the coolness of her gentle palpitation

   Mme. de Villeparisis used to order her carriage early, so that we should have time to reach Saint-Mars le Vêtu, or the rocks of Quetteholme, or some other goal which, for a somewhat lumbering vehicle, was far enough off to require the whole day. In my joy at the long drive we were going to take I would be humming some tune that I had heard recently as I strolled up and down until Mme. de Villeparisis was ready. If it was Sunday hers would not be the only carriage drawn up outside the hotel; several hired flies would be waiting there, not only for the people who had been invited to Féterne by Mme. de Cambremer, but for those who, rather than stay at home all day, like children in disgrace, declared that Sunday was always quite impossible at Balbec and started off immediately after luncheon to hide themselves in some neighbouring watering-place or to visit one of the ‘sights’ of the district. And indeed whenever (which was often) anyone asked Mme. Blandais if she had been to the Cambremers’, she would answer peremptorily: “No; we went to the Falls of the Bee,” as though that were the sole reason for her not having spent the day at Féteme. And the barrister would be charitable, and say:

    “I envy you. I wish I had gone there instead; they must be well worth seeing.”

   Beside the row of carriages, in front of the porch in which I stood waiting, was planted, like some shrub of a rare species, a young page who attracted the eye no less by the unusual and effective colouring of his hair than by his plant-like epidermis. Inside, in the hall, corresponding to the narthex, or Church of the Catechumens in a primitive basilica, through which persons who were not staying in the hotel were entitled to pass, the comrades of this ‘outside’ page did not indeed work much harder than he but did at least execute certain drilled movements. It is probable that in the early morning they helped with the cleaning. But in the afternoon they stood there only like a Chorus who, even when there is nothing for them to do, remain upon the stage in order to strengthen the cast. The General Manager, the same who had so terrified me, reckoned on increasing their number considerably next year, for he had ‘big ideas.’ And this prospect greatly afflicted the manager of the hotel, who found that all these boys about the place only ‘created a nuisance,’ by which he meant that they got in the visitors’ way and were of no use to anyone. But between luncheon and dinner at least, between the exits and entrances of the visitors, they did fill an otherwise empty stage, like those pupils of Mme. de Maintenon who, in the garb of young Israelites, carry on the action whenever Esther or Joad ‘goes off.’ But the outside page, with his delicate tints, his tall, slender, fragile trunk, in proximity to whom I stood waiting for the Marquise to come downstairs, preserved an immobility into which a certain melancholy entered, for his elder brothers had left the hotel for more brilliant careers elsewhere, and he felt keenly his isolation upon this alien soil. At last Mme. de Villeparisis appeared. To stand by her carriage and to help her into it ought perhaps to have been part of the young page’s duties. But he knew on the one hand that a person who brings her own servants to an hotel expects them to wait on her and is not as a rule lavish with her ‘tips,’ and that generally speaking this was true also of the nobility of the old Faubourg Saint-Germain. Mme. de Villeparisis was included in both these categories. The arborescent page concluded therefore that he need expect nothing from her, and leaving her own maid and footman to pack her and her belongings into the carriage, he continued to dream sadly of the enviable lot of his brothers and preserved his vegetable immobility

   We would start off; some time after rounding the railway station, we came into a country road which soon became as familiar to me as the roads round Combray, from the bend where, like a fish-hook, it was baited with charming orchards, to the turning at which we left it, with tilled fields upon either side. Among these we could see here and there an apple-tree, stripped it was true of its blossom, and bearing no more now than a fringe of pistils, but sufficient even so to enchant me since I could imagine, seeing those inimitable leaves, how their broad expanse, like the ceremonial carpet spread for a wedding that was now over, had been but the other day swept by the white satin train of their blushing flowers

   How often in Paris, during the May of the following year, was I to bring home a branch of apple-blossom from the florist, and to stay all night long before its flowers in which bloomed the same creamy essence that powdered besides and whitened the green unfolding leaves, flowers between whose snowy cups it seemed almost as though it had been the salesman who had, in his generosity towards myself, out of his wealth of invention too and as an effective contrast, added on either side the supplement of a becoming crimson bud: I sat gazing at them, I grouped them in the light of my lamp — for so long that I was often still there when the dawn brought to their whiteness the same flush with which it must at that moment have been tingeing their sisters on the Balbec road — and I sought to carry them back in my imagination to that roadside, to multiply them, to spread them out, so as to fill the frame prepared for them, on the canvas, all ready, of those closes the outline of which I knew by heart, which I so longed to see — which one day I must see again, at the moment when, with the exquisite fervour of genius, spring was covering their canvas with its colours

   Before getting into the carriage I had composed the seascape for which I was going to look out, which I had hoped to see with the ‘sun radiant’ upon it, and which at Balbec I could distinguish only in too fragmentary a form, broken by so many vulgar intromissions that had no place in my dream, bathers, dressing-boxes, pleasure yachts. But when, Mme. de Ville-parisis’s carriage having reached high ground, I caught a glimpse of the sea through the leafy boughs of trees, then no doubt at such a distance those temporal details which had set the sea, as it were, apart from nature and history disappeared, and I could as I looked down towards its waves make myself realise that they were the same which Leconte de Lisle describes for us in his Orestie, where “like a flight of birds of prey, before the dawn of day” the long-haired warriors of heroic Hellas “with oars an hundred thousand sweep the huge resounding deep.” But on the other hand I was no longer near enough to the sea which seemed to me not a living thing now, but fixed; I no longer felt any power beneath its colours, spread like those of a picture among the leaves, through which it appeared as inconsistent as the sky and only of an intenser blue

   Mme. de Villeparisis, seeing that I was fond of churches, promised me that we should visit one one day and another another, and especially the church at Carqueville ‘quite buried in all its old ivy,’ as she said with a wave of the hand which seemed tastefully to be clothing the absent ‘front’ in an invisible and delicate screen of foliage. Mme. de Villeparisis would often, with this little descriptive gesture, find just the right word to define the attraction and the distinctive features of an historic building, always avoiding technical terms, but incapable of concealing her thorough understanding of the things to which she referred. She appeared to seek an excuse for this erudition in the fact that one of her father’s country houses, the one in which she had lived as a girl, was situated in a district in which there were churches similar in style to those round Balbec, so that it would have been unaccountable if she had not acquired a taste for architecture, this house being, incidentally, one of the finest examples of that of the Renaissance. But as it was also a regular museum, as moreover Chopin and Liszt had played there, Lamartine recited poetry, all the most famous artists for fully a century inscribed ‘sentiments,’ scored melodies, made sketches in the family album, Mme. de Villeparisis ascribed, whether from delicacy, good breeding, true modesty or want of intelligence, only this purely material origin to her acquaintance with all the arts, and had come, apparently, to regard painting, music, literature and philosophy as the appanage of a young lady brought up on the most aristocratic lines in an historic building that was catalogued and starred. You would have said, listening to her, that she knew of no pictures that were not heirlooms. She was pleased that my grandmother liked a necklace which she wore, and which fell over her dress. It appeared in the portrait of an ancestress of her own by Titian which had never left the family. So that one could be certain of its being genuine. She would not listen to a word about pictures bought, heaven knew where, by a Croesus, she was convinced before you spoke that they were forgeries, and had so desire to see them. We knew that she herself painted flowers in water-colour, and my grandmother, who had heard these praised, spoke to her of them. Mme. de Villeparisis modestly changed the subject, but without shewing either surprise or pleasure more than would an artist whose reputation was established and to whom compliments meant nothing. She said merely that it was a delightful pastime because, even if the flowers that sprang from the brush were nothing wonderful, at least the work made you live in the company of real flowers, of the beauty of which, especially when you were obliged to study them closely in order to draw them, you could never grow tired. But at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis was giving herself a holiday, so as to spare her eyes

   We were astonished, my grandmother and I, to find how much more ‘Liberal’ she was than even the majority of the middle class. She did not understand how anyone could be scandalised by the expulsion of the Jesuits, saying that it had always been done, even under the Monarchy, in Spain even. She took up the defence of the Republic, and against its anti-clericalism had not more to say than: “I should be equally annoyed whether they prevented me from hearing mass when I wanted to, or forced me to hear it when I didn’t!” and even startled us with such utterances as: “Oh! the aristocracy in these days, what does it amount to?” “To my mind, a man who doesn’t work doesn’t count!”— perhaps only because she felt that they gained point and flavour, became memorable, in fact, on her lips

   When we heard these advanced opinions — though never so far advanced as to amount to Socialism, which Mme. de Villeparisis held in abhorrence — expressed so frequently and with so much frankness precisely by one of those people in consideration of whose intelligence our scrupulous and timid impartiality would refuse to condemn outright the ideas of the Conservatives, we came very near, my grandmother and I, to believing that in the pleasant companion of our drives was to be found the measure and the pattern of truth in all things. We took her word for it when she appreciated her Titians, the colonnade of her country house, the conversational talent of Louis-Philippe. But — like those mines of learning who hold us spellbound when we get them upon Egyptian paintings or Etruscan inscriptions, and yet talk so tediously about modern work that we ask ourselves whether we have not been over-estimating the interest of the sciences in which they are versed since there is not apparent in their treatment of them the mediocrity of mind which they must have brought to those studies just as much as to their fatuous essays on Baudelaire — Mme. de Villeparisis, questioned by me about Chateaubriand, about Balzac, about Victor Hugo, each of whom had in his day been the guest of her parents, and had been seen and spoken to by her, smiled at my reverence, told amusing anecdotes of them, such as she had a moment ago been telling us of dukes and statesmen, and severely criticised those writers simply because they had been lacking in that modesty, that self-effacement, that sober art which is satisfied with a single right line, and lays no stress on it, which avoids more than anything else the absurdity of grandiloquence, in that opportuneness, those qualities of moderation, of judgment and simplicity to which she had been taught that real greatness aspired and attained: it was evident that she had no hesitation in placing above them men who might after all, perhaps, by virtue of those qualities, have had the advantage of a Balzac, a Hugo, a Vigny in a drawing-room, an academy, a cabinet council, men like Mole, Fontanes, Vitroles, Bersot, Pasquier, Lebrun, Salvandy or Daru

    “Like those novels of Stendhal, which you seem to admire. You would have given him a great surprise, I assure you, if you had spoken to him in that tone. My father, who used to meet him at M. Mérimée’s — now he was a man of talent, if you like — often told me that Beyle (that was his real name) was appallingly vulgar, but quite good company at dinner, and never in the least conceited about his books. Why, you can see for yourself how he just shrugged his shoulders at the absurdly extravagant compliments of M. de Balzac. There at least he shewed that he knew how to behave like a gentleman.” She possessed the autographs of all these great men, and seemed, when she put forward the personal relations which her family had had with them, to assume that her judgment of them must be better founded than that of young people who, like myself, had had no opportunity of meeting them. “I’m sure I have a right to speak, for they used to come to my father’s house; and as M. Sainte-Beuve, who was a most intelligent man, used to say, in forming an estimate you must take the word of people who saw them close, and were able to judge more exactly of their real worth.”

   Sometimes as the carriage laboured up a steep road through tilled country, making the fields more real, adding to them a mark of authenticity like the precious flower with which certain of the old masters used to sign their pictures, a few hesitating cornflowers, like the Combray cornflowers, would stream in our wake. Presently the horses outdistanced them, but a little way on we would catch sight of another which while it stayed our coming had pricked up to welcome us amid the grass its azure star; some made so bold as to come and plant themselves by the side of the road, and the impression left in my mind was a nebulous blend of distant memories and of wild flowers grown tame

   We began to go down hill; and then met, climbing on foot, on a bicycle, in a cart or carriage, one of those creatures — flowers of a fine day but unlike the flowers of the field, for each of them secretes something that is not to be found in another, with the result that we can never satisfy upon any of her fellows the desire which she has brought to birth in us — a farm-girl driving her cow or half-lying along a waggon, a shopkeeper’s daughter taking the air, a fashionable young lady erect on the back seat of a landau, facing her parents. Certainly Bloch had been the means of opening a new era and had altered the value of life for me on the day when he had told me that the dreams which I had entertained on my solitary walks along the Méséglise way, when I hoped that some peasant girl might pass whom I could take in my arms, were not a mere fantasy which corresponded to nothing outside myself, but that all the girls one met, whether villagers or ‘young ladies,’ were alike ready and willing to give ear to such prayers. And even if I were fated, now that I was ill and did not go out by myself, never to be able to make love to them, I was happy all the same, like a child born in a prison or a hospital, who, having always supposed that the human organism was capable of digesting only dry bread and ‘physic,’ has learned suddenly that peaches, apricots and grapes are not simply part of the decoration of the country scene but delicious and easily assimilated food. Even if his gaoler or his nurse does not allow him to pluck those tempting fruits, still the world seems to him a better place and existence in it more clement. For a desire seems to us more attractive, we repose on it with more confidence, when we know that outside ourselves there is a reality which conforms to it, even if, for us, it is not to be realised. And we think with more joy of a life in which (on condition that we eliminate for a moment from our mind the tiny obstacle, accidental and special, which prevents us personally from doing so) we can imagine ourself to be assuaging that desire. As to the pretty girls who went past, from the day on which I had first known that their cheeks could be kissed, I had become curious about their souls. And the universe had appeared to me more interesting

   Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage moved fast. Scarcely had I time to see the girl who was coming in our direction; and yet — as the beauty of people is not like the beauty of things, as we feel that it is that of an unique creature, endowed with consciousness and free-will — as soon as her individuality, a soul still vague, a will unknown to me, presented a tiny picture of itself, enormously reduced but complete, in the depths of her indifferent eyes, at once, by a mysterious response of the pollen ready in me for the pistils that should receive it, I felt surging through me the embryo, as vague, as minute, of the desire not to let this girl pass without forcing her mind to become conscious of my person, without preventing her desires from wandering to some one else, without coming to fix myself in her dreams and to seize and occupy her heart. Meanwhile our carriage rolled away from her, the pretty girl was already left behind, and as she had — of me — none of those notions which constitute a person in one’s mind, her eyes which had barely seen me had forgotten me already. Was it because I had caught but a fragmentary glimpse of her that I had found her so attractive? It may have been. In the first place, the impossibility of stopping when I came to her, the risk of not meeting her again another day, give at once to such a girl the same charm as a place derives from the illness or poverty that prevents us from visiting it, or the so unadventurous days through which we should otherwise have to live from the battle in which we shall doubtless fall. So that, if there were no such thing as habit, life must appear delightful to those of us who would at every moment be threatened with death — that is to say, to all mankind. Then, if our imagination is set going by the desire for what we may not possess, its flight is not limited by a reality completely perceived, in these casual encounters in which the charms of the passing stranger are generally in direct ratio to the swiftness of our passage. If only night is falling and the carriage is moving fast, whether in town or country, there is not a female torso, mutilated like an antique marble by the speed that tears us away and the dusk that drowns it, but aims at our heart, from every turning in the road, from the lighted interior of every shop, the arrows of Beauty, that Beauty of which we are sometimes tempted to ask ourselves whether it is, in this world, anything more than the complementary part that is added to a fragmentary and fugitive stranger by our imagination over-stimulated by regret

   Had I been free to stop, to get down from the carriage and to speak to the girl whom we were passing, should I perhaps have been disillusioned by some fault in her complexion which from the carriage I had not distinguished? (After which every effort to penetrate into her life would have seemed suddenly impossible. For beauty is a sequence of hypotheses which ugliness cuts short when it bars the way that we could already see opening into the unknown.) Perhaps a single word which she might have uttered, a smile, would have furnished me with a key, a clue that I had not expected, to read the expression of her face, to interpret her bearing, which would at once have ceased to be of any interest. It is possible, for I have never in real life met any girls so desirable as on days when I was with some serious person from whom, despite the — myriad pretexts that I invented, I could not tear myself away: some years after that in which I went for the first time to Balbec, as I was driving through Paris with a friend of my father, and had caught sight of a woman walking quickly along the dark street, I felt that it was unreasonable to forfeit, for a purely conventional scruple, my share of happiness in what may very well be the only life there is, and jumping from the carriage without a word of apology I followed in quest of the stranger; lost her where two streets crossed; caught her up again in a third, and arrived at last, breathless, beneath a street lamp, face to face with old Mme. Verdurin whom I had been carefully avoiding for years, and who, in her delight and surprise, exclaimed: “But how very nice of you to have run all this way just to say how d’ye do to me!”

   That year at Balbec, at the moments of such encounters, I would assure my grandmother and Mme. de Villeparisis that I had so severe a headache that the best thing for me would be to go home alone on foot. But they would never let me get out of the carriage. And I must add that pretty girl (far harder to find again than an historic building, for she was nameless and had the power of locomotion) to the collection of all those whom I promised myself that I would examine more closely at a later date. One of them, however, happened to pass more than once before my eyes in circumstances which allowed me to believe that I should be able to get to know her when I chose. This was a milk-girl who came from a farm with an additional supply of cream for the hotel. I fancied that she had recognised me also; and she did, in fact, look at me with an attentiveness which was perhaps due only to the surprise which my attentiveness caused her. And next day, a day on which I had been resting all morning, when Françoise came in about noon to draw my curtains, she handed me a letter which had been left for me downstairs. I knew no one at Balbec. I had no doubt that the letter was from the milk-girl. Alas, it was only from Bergotte who, as he happened to be passing, had tried to see me, but on hearing that I was asleep had scribbled a few charming lines for which the lift-boy had addressed an envelope which I had supposed to have been written by the milk-girl. I was bitterly disappointed, and the thought that it was more difficult, and more flattering to myself to get a letter from Bergotte did not in the least console me for this particular letter’s not being from her. As for the girl, I never came across her again any more than I came across those whom I had seen only from Mme. de Ville-parisis’s carriage. Seeing and then losing them all thus increased the state of agitation in which I was living, and I found a certain wisdom in the philosophers who recommend us to set a limit to our desires (if, that is, they refer to our desire for people, for that is the only kind that ends in anxiety, having for its object a being at once unknown and unconscious. To suppose that philosophy could refer to the desire for wealth would be too silly.). At the same time I was inclined to regard this wisdom as incomplete, for I said to myself that these encounters made me find even more beautiful a world which thus caused to grow along all the country roads flowers at once rare and common, fleeting treasures of the day, windfalls of the drive, of which the contingent circumstances that would never, perhaps, recur had alone prevented me from taking advantage, and which gave a new zest to life

   But perhaps in hoping that, one day, with greater freedom, I should be able to find on other roads girls much the same, I was already beginning to falsify and corrupt what there is exclusively individual in the desire to live in the company of a woman whom one has found attractive, and by the mere fact that I admitted the possibility of making this desire grow artificially, I had implicitly acknowledged my allusion

   The day on which Mme. de Villeparisis took us to Carqueville, where there was that church, covered in ivy, of which she had spoken to us, a church that, built upon rising ground, dominated both its village and the river that flowed beneath it, and had kept its own little bridge from the middle ages, my grandmother, thinking that I would like to be left alone to study the building at my leisure, suggested to her friend that they should go on and wait for me at the pastry-cook’s, in the village square which was clearly visible from where we were and, in its mellow bloom in the sunshine, seemed like another part of a whole that was all mediaeval. It was arranged that I should join them there later. In the mass of verdure before which I was left standing I was obliged, if I was to discover the church, to make a mental effort which involved my grasping more intensely the idea ‘Church’; in fact, as happens to schoolboys who gather more fully the meaning of a sentence when they are made, by translating or by paraphrasing it, to divest it of the forms to which they are accustomed, this idea of ‘Church,’ which as a rule I scarcely needed when I stood beneath steeples that were recognisable in themselves, I was obliged perpetually to recall so as not to forget, here that the arch in this clump of ivy was that of a pointed window, there that the projection of the leaves was due to the swelling underneath of a capital. Then came a breath of wind, and sent a tremor through the mobile porch, which was overrun by eddies that shot and quivered like a flood of light; the pointed leaves opened one against another; and, shuddering, the arboreal front drew after it green pillars, undulant, caressed and fugitive

   As I came away from the church I saw by the old bridge a cluster of girls from the village who, probably because it was Sunday, were standing about in their best clothes, rallying the young men who went past. Not so well dressed as the others, but seeming to enjoy some ascendancy over them — for she scarcely answered when they spoke to her — with a more serious and a more determined air, there was a tall one who, hoisted upon the parapet of the bridge with her feet hanging down, was holding on her lap a small vessel full of fish which she had presumably just been catching. She had a tanned complexion, gentle eyes but with a look of contempt for her surroundings, a small nose, delicately and attractively modelled. My eyes rested upon her skin; and my lips, had the need arisen, might have believed that they had followed my eyes. But it was not only to her body that I should have liked to attain, there was also her person, which abode within her, and with which there is but one form of contact, namely to attract its attention, but one sort of penetration, to awaken an idea in it

   And this inner self of the charming fisher-girl seemed to be still closed to me, I was doubtful whether I had entered it, even after I had seen my own image furtively reflect itself in the twin mirrors of her gaze, following an index of refraction that was as unknown to me as if I had been placed in the field of vision of a deer. But just as it would not have sufficed that my lips should find pleasure in hers without giving pleasure to them also, so I should have wished that the idea of me which was to enter this creature, was to fasten itself in her, should attract to me not merely her attention but her admiration, her desire, and should compel her to keep me in her memory until the day when I should be able to meet her again. Meanwhile I could see, within a stone’s-throw, the square in which Mme. de Villeparisis’s carriage must be waiting for me. I had not a moment to lose; and already I could feel that the girls were beginning to laugh at the sight of me thus held suspended before them. I had a five-franc piece in my pocket. I drew it out, and, before explaining to the girl the errand on which I proposed to send her, so as to have a better chance of her listening to me, I held the coin for a moment before her eyes

    “Since you seem to belong to the place,” I said to her, “I wonder if you would be so good as to take a message for me. I want you to go to a pastrycook’s — which is apparently in a square, but I don’t know where that is — where there is a carriage waiting for me. One moment! To make quite sure, will you ask if the carriage belongs to the Marquise de Villeparisis? But you can’t miss it; it’s a carriage and pair.”

   That was what I wished her to know, so that she should regard me as someone of importance. But when I had uttered the words ‘Marquise’ and ‘carriage and pair,’ suddenly I had a great sense of calm. I felt that the fisher-girl would remember me, and I felt vanishing, with my fear of not being able to meet her again, part also of my desire to meet her. It seemed to me that I had succeeded in touching her person with invisible lips, and that I had pleased her. And this assault and capture of her mind, this immaterial possession had taken from her part of her mystery, just as physical possession does

   We came down towards Hudimesnil; suddenly I was overwhelmed with that profound happiness which I had not often felt since Combray; happiness analogous to that which had been given me by — among other things — the steeples of Martinville. But this time it remained incomplete. I had just seen, standing a little way back from the steep ridge over which we were passing, three trees, probably marking the entrance to a shady avenue, which made a pattern at which I was looking now not for the first time; I could not succeed in reconstructing the place from which they had been, as it were, detached, but I felt that it had been familiar to me once; so that my mind having wavered between some distant year and the present moment, Balbec and its surroundings began to dissolve and I asked myself whether the whole of this drive were not a make-believe, Balbec a place to which I had never gone save in imagination, Mme. de Villeparisis a character in a story and the three old trees the reality which one recaptures on raising one’s eyes from the book which one has been reading and which describes an environment into which one has come to believe that one has been bodily transported

   I looked at the three trees; I could see them plainly, but my mind felt that they were concealing something which it had not grasped, as when things are placed out of our reach, so that our fingers, stretched out at arm’s-length, can only touch for a moment their outer surface, and can take hold of nothing. Then we rest for a little while before thrusting out our arm with refreshed vigour, and trying to reach an inch or two farther. But if my mind was thus to collect itself, to gather strength, I should have to be alone. What would I not have given to be able to escape as I used to do on those walks along the Guermantes way, when I detached myself from my parents! It seemed indeed that I ought to do so now. I recognised that kind of pleasure which requires, it is true, a certain effort on the part of the mind, but in comparison with which the attractions of the inertia which inclines us to renounce that pleasure seem very slight. That pleasure, the object of which I could but dimly feel, that pleasure which I must create for myself, I experienced only on rare occasions, but on each of these it seemed to me that the things which had happened in the interval were of but scant importance, and that in attaching myself to the reality of that pleasure alone I could at length begin to lead a new life. I laid my hand for a moment across my eyes, so as to be able to shut them without Mme. de Villeparisis’s noticing. I sat there, thinking of nothing, then with my thoughts collected, compressed and strengthened I sprang farther forward in the direction of the trees, or rather in that inverse direction at the end of which I could see them growing within myself. I felt again behind them the same object, known to me and yet vague, which I could not bring nearer. And yet all three of them, as the carriage moved on, I could see coming towards me. Where had I looked at them before? There was no place near Combray where an avenue opened off the road like that. The site which they recalled to me, there was no room for it either in the scenery of the place in Germany where I had gone one year with my grandmother to take the waters. Was I to suppose, then, that they came from years already so remote in my life that the landscape which accompanied them had been entirely obliterated from my memory, and that, like the pages which, with sudden emotion, we recognise in a book which we imagined that we had never read, they surged up by themselves out of the forgotten chapter of my earliest infancy? Were they not rather to be numbered among those dream landscapes, always the same, at least for me in whom their unfamiliar aspect was but the objectivation in my dreams of the effort that I had been making while awake either to penetrate the mystery of a place beneath the outward appearance of which I was dimly conscious of there being something more, as had so often happened to me on the Guermantes way, or to succeed in bringing mystery back to a place which I had longed to know and which, from the day on which I had come to know it, had seemed to me to be wholly superficial, like Balbec? Or were they but an image freshly extracted from a dream of the night before, but already so worn, so altered that it seemed to me to come from somewhere far more distant? Or had I indeed never seen them before; did they conceal beneath their surface, like the trees, like the tufts of grass that I had seen beside the Guermantes way, a meaning as obscure, as hard to grasp as is a distant past, so that, whereas they are pleading with me that I would master a new idea, I imagined that I had to identify something in my memory? Or again were they concealing no hidden thought, and was it simply my strained vision that made me see them double in time as one occasionally sees things double in space? I could not tell. And yet all the time they were coming towards me; perhaps some fabulous apparition, a ring of witches or of norns who would propound their oracles to me. I chose rather to believe that they were phantoms of the past, dear companions of my childhood, vanished friends who recalled our common memories. Like ghosts they seemed to be appealing to me to take them with me, to bring them back to life. In their simple, passionate gesticulation I could discern the helpless anguish of a beloved person who has lost the power of speech, and feels that he will never be able to say to us what he wishes to say and we can never guess. Presently, at a cross-roads, the carriage left them. It was bearing me away from what alone I believed to be true, what would have made me truly happy; it was like my life

   I watched the trees gradually withdraw, waving their despairing arms, seeming to say to me: “What you fail to learn from us to-day, you will never know. If you allow us to drop back into the hollow of this road from which we sought to raise ourselves up to you, a whole part of yourself which we were bringing to you will fall for ever into the abyss.” And indeed if, in the course of time, I did discover the kind of pleasure and of disturbance which I had just been feeling once again, and if one evening — too late, but then for all time — I fastened myself to it, of those trees themselves I was never to know what they had been trying to give me nor where else I had seen them. And when, the road having forked and the carriage with it, I turned my back on them and ceased to see them, with Mme. de Villeparisis asking me what I was dreaming about, I was as wretched as though I had just lost a friend, had died myself, had broken faith with the dead or had denied my God

   It was time to be thinking of home. Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a certain feeling for nature, colder than that of my grandmother but capable of recognising, even outside museums and noblemen’s houses, the simple and majestic beauty of certain old and venerable things, told her coachman to take us back by the old Balbec road, a road little used but planted with old elm-trees which we thought quite admirable

   Once we had got to know this road, for a change we would return — that is, if we had not taken it on the outward journey — by another which ran through the woods of Chantereine and Canteloup. The invisibility of the numberless birds that took up one another’s song close beside us in the trees gave me the same sense of being at rest that one has when one shuts one’s eyes. Chained to my back-seat like Prometheus on his rock I listened to my Oceanides. And when it so happened that I caught a glimpse of one of those birds as it passed from one leaf to another, there was so little apparent connexion between it and the songs that I heard that I could not believe that I was beholding their cause in that little body, fluttering, startled and unseeing

   This road was like many others of the same kind which are to be found in France, climbing on a fairly steep gradient to its summit and then gradually falling for the rest of the way. At the time, I found no great attraction in it, I was only glad to be going home. But it became for me later on a frequent source of joy by remaining in my memory as a lodestone to which all the similar roads that I was to take, on walks or drives or journeys, would at once attach themselves without breach of continuity and would be able, thanks to it, to communicate directly with my heart. For as soon as the carriage or the motor-car turned into one of these roads that seemed to be merely the continuation of the road along which I had driven with Mme. de Villeparisis, the matter to which I found my consciousness directly applying itself, as to the most recent event in my past, would be (all the intervening years being quietly obliterated) the impressions that I had had on those bright summer afternoons and evenings, driving round Balbec, when the leaves smelt good, a mist rose from the ground, and beyond the village close at hand one could see through the trees the sun setting as though it had been merely some place farther along the road, a forest place and distant, which we should not have time to reach that evening. Harmonised with what I was feeling now in another place, on a similar road, surrounded by all the accessory sensations of breathing deep draughts of air, of curiosity, indolence, appetite, lightness of heart which were common to them both, and excluding all others, these impressions would be reinforced, would take on the consistency of a particular type of pleasure, and almost of a setting of life which, as it happened, I rarely had the luck to-come across, but in which these awakened memories placed, amid the reality that my senses could perceive, no small part of a reality suggested, dreamed, unseizable, to give me, among those regions through which I was passing, more than an aesthetic feeling, a transient but exalted ambition to stay there and to live there always. How often since then, simply because I could smell green leaves, has not being seated on a backseat opposite Mme. de Villeparisis, meeting the Princesse de Luxembourg who waved a greeting to her from her own carriage, coming back to dinner at the Grand Hotel appeared to me as one of those indescribable happinesses which neither the present nor the future can restore to us, which we may taste once only in a lifetime

   Often dusk would have fallen before we reached the hotel. Timidly I would quote to Mme. de Villeparisis, pointing to the moon in the sky, some memorable expression of Chateaubriand or Vigny or Victor Hugo: ‘Shedding abroad that ancient secret of melancholy’ or ‘Weeping like Diana by the brink of her streams’ or ‘The shadows nuptial, solemn and august.’

    “And so you think that good, do you?” she would ask, “inspired, as you call it. I must confess that I am always surprised to see people taking things seriously nowadays which the friends of those gentlemen, while doing ample justice to their merits, were the first to laugh at. People weren’t so free then with the word ‘inspired’ as they are now, when if you say to a writer that he has mere talent he thinks you’re insulting him. You quote me a fine passage from M. de Chateaubriand about moonlight. You shall see that I have my own reasons for being refractory. M. de Chateaubriand used constantly to come to see my father. He was quite a pleasant person when you were alone with him, because then he was simple and amusing, but the moment he had an audience he would begin to pose, and then he became absurd; when my father was in the room, he pretended that he had flung his resignation in the King’s face, and that he had controlled the voting in the Conclave, forgetting that it was my father whom he had asked to beg the King to take him back, and that my father had heard him make the most idiotic forecasts of the Papal election. You ought to have heard M. de Blacas on that famous Conclave; he was a very different kind of man from M. de Chateaubriand. As to his fine phrases about the moon, they became part of our regular programme for entertaining our guests. Whenever there was any moonlight about the house, if there was anyone staying with us for the first time he would be told to take M. de Chateaubriand for a stroll after dinner. When they came in, my father would take his guest aside and say: ‘Well, and was M. de Chateaubriand very eloquent?’—‘Oh, yes.’ ‘He’s been talking about the moon?’—‘Yes, how did you know?’—‘One moment, didn’t he say ——’ and then my father would quote the passage. ‘He did; but how in the world . . .?’—‘And he spoke to you of the moonlight on the Roman Campagna?’—‘But, my dear sir, you’re a magician.’ My father was no magician, but M. de Chateaubriand had the same little speech about the moon which he served up every time.”

   At the mention of Vigny she laughed: “The man who said: ‘I am the Comte Alfred de Vigny!’ One either is a Comte or one isn’t; it is not of the slightest importance.” And then perhaps she discovered that it was after all, of some slight importance, for she went on: “For one thing I am by no means sure that he was, and in any case he was of the humblest origin, that gentleman who speaks in his verses of his ‘Esquire’s crest.’ In such charming taste, is it not, and so interesting to his readers! Like Musset, a plain Paris cit, who laid so much stress on ‘The golden falcon that surmounts my helm.’ As if you would ever hear a real gentleman say a thing like that! And yet Musset had some talent as a poet. But except Cinq-Mars I have never been able to read a thing by M. de Vigny. I get so bored that the book falls from my hands. M. Mole, who had all the cleverness and tact that were wanting in M. de Vigny, put him properly in his place when he welcomed him to the Academy. Do you mean to say you don’t know the speech? It is a masterpiece of irony and impertinence.” She found fault with Balzac, whom she was surprised to see her nephews admire, for having pretended to describe a society ‘in which he was never received’ and of which his descriptions were wildly improbable. As for Victor Hugo, she told us that M. de Bouillon, her father, who had friends among the young leaders of the Romantic movement, had been taken by some of them to the first performance of Hernani, but that he had been unable to sit through it, so ridiculous had he found the lines of that talented but extravagant writer who had acquired the title of ‘Major Poet’ only by virtue of having struck a bargain, and as a reward for the not disinterested indulgence that he shewed to the dangerous errors of the Socialists

   We had now come in sight of the hotel, with its lights, so hostile that first evening, on our arrival, now protecting and kind, speaking to us of home. And when the carriage drew up outside the door, the porter, the pages, the lift-boy, attentive, clumsy, vaguely uneasy at our lateness, were numbered, now that they had grown familiar, among those beings who change so many times in the course of our life, as we ourself change, but by whom, when they are for the time being the mirror of our habits, we find something attractive in the feeling that we are being faithfully reflected and in a friendly spirit. We prefer them to friends whom we have not seen for some time, for they contain more of what we actually are. Only the outside page, exposed to the sun all day, had been taken indoors for protection from the cold night air and swaddled in thick woollen garments which, combined with the orange effulgence of his locks and the curiously red bloom of his cheeks, made one, seeing him there through the glass front of the hall, think of a hot-house plant muffled up for protection from the frost. We got out of the carriage, with the help of a great many more servants than were required, but they were conscious of the importance of the scene and each felt obliged to take some part in it. I was always very hungry. And so, often, so as not to keep dinner waiting, I would not go upstairs first to the room which had succeeded in becoming so really mine that to catch sight of its long violet curtains and low bookcases was to find myself alone again with that self of which things, like people, gave me a reflected image; but we would all wait together in the hall until the head waiter came to tell us that our dinner was ready. And this gave us another opportunity of listening to Mme. de Villeparisis

    “But you must be tired of us by now,” protested my grandmother

    “Not at all! Why, I am delighted, what could be nicer?” replied her friend with a winning smile, drawing out, almost intoning her words in a way that contrasted markedly with her customary simplicity of speech

   And indeed at such moments as this she was not natural, her mind reverted to her early training, to the aristocratic manner in which a great lady is supposed to shew common people that she is glad to see them, that she is not at all stiff. And her one and only failure in true politeness lay in this excess of politeness; which it was easy to identify as one of the professional ‘wrinkles’ of a lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, who, always seeing in her humbler friends the latent discontent that she must one day arouse in their bosoms, greedily seizes every opportunity en which she can possibly, in the ledger in which she keeps her social account with them, write down a credit balance which will allow her to enter presently on the opposite page the dinner or reception to which she will not invite them. And so, having long ago taken effect in her once and for all, and ignoring the fact that now both the circumstances and the people concerned were different, that in Paris she hoped to see us often come to her house, the spirit of her caste was urging Mme. de Villeparisis on with feverish ardour, and as if the time that was allowed her for being kind to us was limited, to multiply, while we were still at Balbec, her gifts of roses and melons, loans of books, drives in her carriage and verbal effusions. And for that reason, quite as much as the dazzling glories of the beach, the many-coloured flamboyance and subaqueous light of the rooms, as much even as the riding-lessons by which tradesmen’s sons were deified like Alexander of Macedon, the daily kindnesses shewn us by Mme. de Villeparisis and also the unaccustomed, momentary, holiday ease with which my grandmother accepted them have remained in my memory as typical of life at a watering-place

    “Give them your cloaks to take upstairs.”

   My grandmother handed hers to the manager, and because he had been so nice to me I was distressed by this want of consideration, which seemed to pain him

    “I think you’ve hurt his feelings,” said the Marquise. “He probably fancies himself too great a gentleman to carry your wraps. I remember so well the Duc de Nemours, when I was still quite little, coming to see my father who was living then on the top floor of the Bouillon house, with a fat parcel under his arm of letters and newspapers. I can see the Prince now, in his blue coat, framed in our doorway, which had such pretty woodwork round it — I think it was Bagard made it — you know those fine laths that they used to cut, so supple that the joiner would twist them sometimes into little shells and flowers, like the ribbons round a nosegay. ‘Here you are, Cyrus,’ he said to my father, ‘look what your porter’s given me to bring you. He said to me: “Since you’re going up to see the Count, it’s not worth my while climbing all those stairs; but take care you don’t break the string.”’ Now that you have got rid of your things, why don’t you sit down; look, sit in this seat,” she said to my grandmother, taking her by the hand

    “Oh, if you don’t mind, not in that one! There is not room for two, and it’s too big for me by myself; I shouldn’t feel comfortable.”

    “You remind me, for it was exactly like this, of a seat that I had for many years until at last I couldn’t keep it any longer because it had been given to my mother by the poor Duchesse de Praslin. My mother, though she was the simplest person in the world, really, had ideas that belonged to another generation, which even in those days I could scarcely understand; and at first she had not been at all willing to let herself be introduced to Mme. de Praslin, who had been plain Mlle. Sébastian!, while she, because she was a Duchess, felt that it was not for her to be introduced to my mother. And really, you know,” Mme. de Villeparisis went on, forgetting that she herself did not understand these fine shades of distinction, “even if she had just been Mme. de Choiseul, there was a good deal to be said for her claim. The Choiseuls are everything you could want; they spring from a sister of Louis the Fat; they were ruling princes down in Basigny. I admit that we beat them in marriages and in distinction, but the precedence is pretty much the same. This little difficulty gave rise to several amusing incidents, such as a luncheon party which was kept waiting a whole hour or more before one of these ladies could make up her mind to let herself be introduced to the other. In spite of which they became great friends, and she gave my mother a seat like that, in which people always refused to sit, just as you did, until one day my mother heard a carriage drive into the courtyard. She asked a young servant we had, who it was. ‘The Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, ma’am.’ ‘Very well, say that I am at home.’ A quarter of an hour passed; no one came. ‘What about the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld?’ my mother asked. ‘Where is she?’ ‘She’s on the stairs, ma’am, getting her breath,’ said the young servant, who had not been long up from the country, where my mother had the excellent habit of getting all her servants. Often she had seen them born. That’s the only way to get really good ones. And they’re the rarest of luxuries. And sure enough the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld had the greatest difficulty in getting upstairs, for she was an enormous woman, so enormous, indeed, that when she did come into the room my mother was quite at a loss for a moment to know where to put her. And then the seat that Mme. de Praslin had given her caught her eye. ‘Won’t you sit down?’ she said, bringing it forward. And the Duchess filled it from side to side. She was quite a pleasant woman, for all her massiveness. ‘She still creates an effect when she comes in,’ one of our friends said once. ‘She certainly creates an effect when she goes out,’ said my mother, who was rather more free in her speech than would be thought proper nowadays. Even in Mme. de La Rochefoucauld’s own drawing-room people weren’t afraid to make fun of her to her face (at which she was always the first to laugh) over her ample proportions. ‘But are you all alone?’ my grandmother once asked M. de La Rochefoucauld, when she had come to pay a call on the Duchess, and being met at the door by him had not seen his wife who was at the other end of the room. ‘Is Mme. de La Rochefoucauld not at home? I don’t see her.’—‘How charming of you!’ replied the Duke, who had about the worst judgment of any man I have ever known, but was not altogether lacking in humour.”

   After dinner, when I had retired upstairs with my grandmother, I said to her that the qualities which attracted us in Mme. de Villeparisis, her tact, her shrewdness, her discretion, her modesty in not referring to herself, were not, perhaps, of very great value since those who possessed them in the highest degree were simply people like Mole and Loménie, and that if the want of them can make our social relations unpleasant yet it did not prevent from becoming Chateaubriand, Vigny, Hugo, Balzac, a lot of foolish fellows who had no judgment, at whom it was easy to mock, like Bloch. . . . But at the name of Bloch, my grandmother cried out in protest. And she began to praise Mme. de Villeparisis. As we are told that it is the preservation of the species which guides our individual preferences in love, and, so that the child may be constituted in the most normal fashion, sends fat men in pursuit of lean women and vice versa, so in some dim way it was the requirements of my happiness threatened by my disordered nerves, by my morbid tendency to melancholy, to solitude, that made her allot the highest place to the qualities of balance and judgment, peculiar not only to Mme. de Villeparisis but to a society in which our ancestors saw blossom the minds of a Doudan, a M. de Rémusat, not to mention a Beausergent, a Joubert, a Sévigné, a type of mind that invests life with more happiness, with greater dignity than the converse refinements which brought a Baudelaire, a Poe, a Verlaine, a Rimbaud to sufferings, to a disrepute such as my grandmother did not wish for her daughter’s child. I interrupted her with a kiss and asked her if she had noticed some expression which Mme. de Villeparisis had used and which seemed to point to a woman who thought more of her noble birth than she was prepared to admit. In this way I used to submit my impressions of life to my grandmother, for I was never certain what degree of respect was due to anyone until she had informed me. Every evening I would come to her with the mental sketches that I had made during the day of all those non-existent people who were not her. Once I said to her: “I shouldn’t be able to live without you.” “But you mustn’t speak like that;” her voice was troubled. “We must harden our hearts more than that, you know. Or what would become of you if I went away on a journey? But I hope that you would be quite sensible and quite happy.”

    “I could manage to be sensible if you went away for a few days, but I should count the hours.”

    “But if I were to go away for months . . . ” (at the bare suggestion of such a thing my heart was wrung) “ . . . for years . . . for . . . ”

   We both remained silent. We dared not look one another in the face. And yet I was suffering more keenly from her anguish than from my own. And so I walked across to the window, and said to her, with a studied clearness of tone but with averted eyes:

    “You know what a creature of habit I am. For the first few days after I have been parted from the people I love best, I am wretched. But though I go on loving them just as much, I grow used to their absence; life becomes calm, bearable, pleasant; I could stand being parted from them for months, for years . . . ”

   I was obliged to stop, and looked straight out of the window. My grandmother went out of the room for something. But next day I began to talk to her about philosophy, and, speaking in a tone of complete indifference, but at the same time taking care that my grandmother should pay attention to what I was saying, I remarked what a curious thing it was that, according to the latest scientific discoveries, the materialist position appeared to be crumbling, and the most likely thing to be, once again, the survival of the soul and reunion in a life everlasting

   Mme. de Villeparisis gave us warning that presently she would not be able to see so much of us. A young nephew who was preparing for Sau-mur, and was meanwhile stationed in the neighbourhood, at Doncières, was coming to spend a few weeks’ furlough with her, and she would be devoting most of her time to him. In the course of our drives together she had boasted to us of his extreme cleverness, and above all of his goodness of heart; already I was imagining that he would have an instinctive feeling for me, that I was to be his best friend; and when, before his arrival, his aunt gave my grandmother to understand that he had unfortunately fallen into the clutches of an appalling woman with whom he was quite infatuated and who would never let him go, since I believed that that sort of love was doomed to end in mental aberration, crime and suicide, thinking how short the time was that was set apart for our friendship, already so great in my heart, although I had not yet set eyes on him, I wept for that friendship and for the misfortunes that were in store for it, as we weep for a person whom we love when some one has just told us that he is seriously ill and that his days are numbered

   One afternoon of scorching heat I was in the dining-room of the hotel, which they had plunged in semi-darkness, to shield it from the glare, by drawing the curtains which the sun gilded, while through the gaps between them I caught flashing blue glimpses of the sea, when along the central gangway leading inland from the beach to the high road I saw, tall, slender, his head held proudly erect upon a springing neck, a young man go past with searching eyes, whose skin was as fair and whose hair as golden as if they had absorbed all the rays of the%un. Dressed in a clinging, almost white material such as I could never have believed that any man would have the audacity to wear, the thinness of which suggested no less vividly than the coolness of the dining-room the heat and brightness of the glorious day outside, he was walking fast. His eyes, from one of which a monocle kept dropping, were of the colour of the sea. Everyone looked at him with interest as he passed, knowing that this young Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray was famed for the smartness of his clothes. All the newspapers had described the suit in which he had recently acted as second to the young Duc d’Uzès in a duel. One felt that this so special quality of his hair, his eyes, his skin, his figure, which would have marked him out in a crowd like a precious vein of opal, azure-shot and luminous, embedded in a mass of coarser substance, must correspond to a life different from that led by other men. So that when, before the attachment which Mme. de Villeparisis had been deploring, the prettiest women in society had disputed the possession of him, his presence, at a watering-place for instance, in the company of the beauty of the season to whom he was paying court, not only made her conspicuous, but attracted every eye fully as much to himself. Because of his ‘tone,’ of his impertinence befitting a young ‘lion,’ and especially of his astonishing good looks, some people even thought him effeminate, though without attaching any stigma, for everyone knew how manly he was and that he was a passionate ‘womaniser.’ This was Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew of whom she had spoken to us. I was overcome with joy at the thought that I was going to know him and to see him for several weeks on end, and confident that he would bestow on me all his affection. He strode rapidly across the hotel, seeming to be in pursuit of his monocle, which kept darting away in front of him like a butterfly. He was coming from the beach, and the sea which filled the lower half of the glass front of the hall gave him a background against which he was drawn at full length, as in certain portraits whose painters attempt, without in anyway falsifying the most accurate observation of contemporary life, but by choosing for their sitter appropriate surroundings, a polo ground, golf links, a racecourse, the bridge of a yacht, to furnish a modern equivalent of those canvases on which the old masters used to present the human figure in the foreground of a landscape. A carriage and pair was waiting for him at the door; and, while his monocle resumed its gambollings in the air of the sunlit street, with the elegance and mastery which a great pianist contrives to display in the simplest piece of execution, where it has not appeared possible that he could shew himself superior to a performer of the second class, Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew, taking the reins that were handed him by the groom, jumped on to the box seat by his side and, while he opened a letter which the manager of the hotel sent out after him, made his horses start

   What a disappointment was mine on the days that followed, when, each time that I met him outside or in the hotel — his head erect, perpetually balancing the movements of his limbs round the fugitive and dancing monocle which seemed to be their centre of gravity — I was forced to admit that he had evidently no desire to make our acquaintance, and saw that he did not bow to us although he must have known that we were friends of his aunt. And calling to mind the friendliness that Mme. de Villeparisis, and before her M. de Norpois, had shewn me, I thought that perhaps they were only of a bogus nobility, and that there might be a secret section in the laws that govern the aristocracy which allowed women, perhaps, and certain diplomats to discard, in their relations with plebeians, for a reason which was beyond me, the stiffness which must, on the other hand, be pitilessly maintained by a young Marquis. My intelligence might have told me the opposite. But the characteristic feature of the silly phase through which I was passing — a phase by no means irresponsive, indeed highly fertile — is that we do not consult our intelligence and that the most trivial attributes of other people seem to us then to form an inseparable part of their personality. In a world thronged with monsters and with gods, we are barely conscious of tranquillity. There is hardly one of the actions which we performed in that phase which we would not give anything, in later life, to be able to erase from our memory. Whereas what we ought to regret is that we no longer possess the spontaneity which made us perform them. In later life we look at things in a more practical way, in full conformity with the rest of society, but youth was the only time in which we learned anything

   This insolence which I surmised in M. de Saint-Loup, and all that it implied of ingrained severity, received confirmation from his attitude whenever he passed us, his body as inflexibly erect, his head always held as high, his gaze as impassive, or rather, I should say, as implacable, devoid of that vague respect which one has for the rights of other people, even if they do not know one’s aunt, one example of which was that I did not look in quite the same way at an old lady as at a gas lamp. These frigid manners were as far removed from the charming letters which, but a few days since, I had still been imagining him as writing to tell me of his regard for myself, as is removed from the enthusiasm of the Chamber and of the populace which he has been picturing himself as rousing by an imperishable speech, the humble, dull, obscure position of the dreamer who, after pondering it thus by himself, for himself, aloud, finds himself, once the imaginary applause has died away, just the same Tom, Dick or Harry as before. When Mme. de Villeparisis, doubtless in an attempt to counteract the bad impression that had been made on us by an exterior indicative of an arrogant and evil nature, spoke to us again of the inexhaustible goodness of her great-nephew (he was the son of one of her nieces, and a little older than myself), I marvelled how the world, with an utter disregard of truth, ascribes tenderness of heart to people whose hearts are in reality so hard and dry, provided only that they behave with common courtesy to the brilliant members of their own sets. Mme. de Villeparisis herself confirmed, though indirectly, my diagnosis, which was already a conviction, of the essential points of her nephew’s character one day when I met them both coming along a path so narrow that there was nothing for it but to introduce me to him. He seemed not to hear that a person’s name was being repeated to him, not a muscle of his face moved; his eyes, in which there shone not the faintest gleam of human sympathy, shewed merely in the insensibility, in the inanity of their gaze an exaggeration failing which there would have been nothing to distinguish them from lifeless mirrors. Then fastening on me those hard eyes, as though he wished to make sure of me before returning my salute, by an abrupt release which seemed to be due rather to a reflex action of his muscles than to an exercise of will, keeping between himself and me the greatest possible interval, he stretched his arm out to its full extension and, at the end of it, offered me his hand. I supposed that it must mean, at the very least, a duel when, next day, he sent me his card. But he spoke to me only of literature, declared after a long talk that he would like immensely to spend several hours with me every day. He had not only, in this encounter, given proof of an ardent zest for the things of the spirit, he had shewn a regard for myself which was little in keeping with his greeting of me the day before. After I had seen him repeat the same process whenever anyone was introduced to him, I realised that it was simply a social usage peculiar to his branch of the family, to which his mother, who had seen to it that he should be perfectly brought up, had moulded his limbs; he went through those motions without thinking, any more than he thought about his beautiful clothes or hair; they were a thing devoid of the moral significance which I had at first ascribed to them, a thing purely acquired like that other habit that he had of at once demanding an introduction to the family of anyone whom he knew, which had become so instinctive in him that, seeing me again the day after our talk, he fell upon me and without asking how I did begged me to make him known to my grandmother, who was with me, with the same feverish haste as if the request had been due to some instinct of self-preservation, like the act of warding off a blow, or of shutting one’s eyes to avoid a stream of boiling water, without which precautions it would have been dangerous to stay where one was a moment longer

   The first rites of exorcism once performed, as a wicked fairy discards her outer form and endures all the most enchanting graces, I saw this disdainful creature become the most friendly, the most considerate young man that I had ever met. “Good,” I said to myself, “I’ve been mistaken about him once already; I was taken in by a mirage; but I have corrected the first only to fall into a second, for he must be a great gentleman who has grown sick of his nobility and is trying to hide it.” As a matter of fact it was not long before all the exquisite breeding, all the friendliness of Saint-Loup were indeed to let me see another creature but one very different from what I had suspected

   This young man who had the air of a scornful, sporting aristocrat had in fact no respect, no interest save for and in the things of the spirit, and especially those modern manifestations of literature and art which seemed so ridiculous to his aunt; he was imbued, moreover, with what she called ‘Socialistic spoutings,’ was filled with the most profound contempt for his caste and spent long hours in the study of Nietzsche and Proudhon. He was one of those intellectuals, quick to admire what is good, who shut themselves up in a book, and are interested only in pure thought. Indeed in Saint-Loup the expression of this highly abstract tendency, which removed him so far from my customary preoccupations, while it seemed to me touching, also annoyed me not a little. I may say that when I realised properly who had been his father, on days when I had been reading memoirs rich in anecdotes of that famous Comte de Marsantes, in whom were embodied the special graces of a generation already remote, the mind full of speculation — anxious to obtain fuller details of the life that M. de Marsantes had led, it used to infuriate me that Robert de Saint-Loup, instead of being content to be the son of his father, instead of being able to guide me through the old-fashioned romance of what had been that father’s existence, had trained himself to enjoy Nietzsche and Proudhon. His father would not have shared my regret. He had been himself a man of brains, who had transcended the narrow confines of his life as a man of the world. He had hardly had time to know his son, but had hoped that his son would prove a better man than himself. And I really believe that, unlike the rest of the family, he would have admired his son, would have rejoiced at his abandoning what had been his own small diversions for austere meditations, and without saying a word, in his modesty as a great gentleman endowed with brains, he would have read in secret his son’s favourite authors in order to appreciate how far Robert was superior to himself

   There was, however, this rather painful consideration: that if M. de Marsantes, with his extremely open mind, would have appreciated a son so different from himself, Robert de Saint-Loup, because he was one of those who believe that merit is attached only to certain forms of art and life, had an affectionate but slightly contemptuous memory of a father who had spent all his time hunting and racing, who yawned at Wagner and raved over Offenbach. Saint-Loup had not the intelligence to see that intellectual worth has nothing to do with adhesion to any one aesthetic formula, and had for the intellectuality of M. de Marsantes much the same sort of scorn as might have been felt for Boieldieu or Labiche by a son of Boieldieu or Labiche who had become adepts in the most symbolic literature and the most complex music. “I scarcely knew my father,” he used to say. “He seems to have been a charming person. His tragedy was the deplorable age in which he lived. To have been born in the Faubourg Saint-Germain and to have to live in the days of La Belle Hélène would be enough to wreck any existence. Perhaps if he’d been some little shopkeeper mad about the Ring he’d have turned out quite different. Indeed they tell me that he was fond of literature. But that can never be proved, because literature to him meant such utterly god-forsaken books.” And in my own case, if I found Saint-Loup a trifle earnest, he could not understand why I was not more earnest still. Never judging anything except by the weight of the intelligence that it contained, never perceiving the magic appeal to the imagination that I found in things which he condemned as frivolous, he was astonished that I— I, to whom he imagined himself to be so utterly inferior — could take any interest in them

   >From the first Saint-Loup made a conquest of my grandmother, not only by the incessant acts of kindness which he went out of his way to shew to us both, but by the naturalness which he put into them as into everything. For naturalness — doubtless because through the artifice of man it allows a feeling of nature to permeate — was the quality which my grandmother preferred to all others, whether in gardens, where she did not like there to be, as there had been in our Combray garden, too formal borders, or at table, where she detested those dressed-up dishes in which you could hardly detect the foodstuffs that had gone to make them, or in piano-playing, which she did not like to be too finicking, too laboured, having indeed had a special weakness for the discords, the wrong notes of Rubinstein. This naturalness she found and enjoyed even in the clothes that Saint-Loup wore, of a pliant elegance, with nothing swagger, nothing formal about them, no stiffness or starch. She appreciated this rich young man still more highly for the free and careless way that he had of living in luxury without ‘smelling of money,’ without giving himself airs; she even discovered the charm of this naturalness in the incapacity which Saint-Loup had kept, though as a rule it is outgrown with childhood, at the same time as certain physiological peculiarities of that period, for preventing his face from at once reflecting every emotion. Something, for instance, that he wanted to have but had not expected, were it no more than a compliment, reacted in him in a burst of pleasure so quick, so burning, so volatile, so expansive that it was impossible for him to contain and to conceal it; a grin of delight seized irresistible hold of his face; the too delicate skin of his cheeks allowed a vivid glow to shine through them, his eyes sparkled with confusion and joy; and my grandmother was infinitely touched by this charming show of innocence and frankness, which, incidentally, in Saint-Loup — at any rate at the period of our first friendship — was not misleading. But I have known another person, and there are many such, in whom the physiological sincerity of that fleeting blush in no way excluded moral duplicity; as often as not it proves nothing more than the vivacity with which pleasure is felt — so that it disarms them and they are forced publicly to confess it — by natures capable of the vilest treachery. But where my grandmother did really adore Saint-Loup’s naturalness was in his way of admitting, without any evasion, his affection for me, to give expression to which he found words than which she herself, she told me, could not have thought of any more appropriate, more truly loving, words to which ‘Sévigné and Beausergent’ might have set their signatures. He was not afraid to make fun of my weaknesses — which he had discerned with an acuteness that made her smile — but as she herself would have done, lovingly, at the same time extolling my good qualities with a warmth, an impulsive freedom that shewed no sign of the reserve, the coldness by means of which young men of his age are apt to suppose that they give themselves importance. And he shewed in forestalling every discomfort, however slight, in covering my legs if the day had turned cold without my noticing it, in arranging (without telling me) to stay later with me in the evening if he thought that I was depressed or felt unwell, a vigilance which, from the point of view of my health, for which a more hardening discipline would perhaps have been better, my grandmother found almost excessive, though as a proof of his affection for myself she was deeply touched by it

   It was promptly settled between us that he and I were to be great friends for ever, and he would say ‘our friendship’ as though he were speaking of some important and delightful thing which had an existence independent of ourselves, and which he soon called — not counting his love for his mistress — the great joy of his life. These words made me rather uncomfortable and I was at a loss for an answer, for I did not feel when I was with him and talked to him — and no doubt it would have been the same with everyone else — any of that happiness which it was, on the other hand, possible for me to experience when I was by myself. For alone, at times, I felt surging from the depths of my being one or other of those impressions which gave me a delicious sense of comfort. But as soon as I was with some one else, when I began to talk to a friend, my mind at once ‘turned about,’ it was towards the listener and not myself that it directed its thoughts, and when they followed this outward course they brought me no pleasure. Once I had left Saint-Loup, I managed, with the help of words, to put more or less in order the confused minutes that I had spent with him; I told myself that I had a good friend, that a good friend was a rare thing, and I tasted, when I felt myself surrounded by ‘goods’ that were difficult to acquire, what was precisely the opposite of the pleasure that was natural to me, the opposite of the pleasure of having extracted from myself and brought to light something that was hidden in my inner darkness. If I had spent two or three hours in conversation with Saint-Loup, and he had expressed his admiration of what I had said to him, I felt a sort of remorse, or regret, or weariness at not having been left alone and ready, at last, to begin my work. But I told myself that one is not given intelligence for one’s own benefit only, that the greatest of men have longed for appreciation, that I could not regard as wasted hours in which I had built up an exalted idea of myself in the mind of my friend; I had no difficulty in persuading myself that I ought to be happy in consequence, and I hoped all the more anxiously that this happiness might never be taken from me simply because I had not yet been conscious of it. We fear more than the loss of everything else the disappearance of the ‘goods’ that have remained beyond our reach, because our heart has not taken possession of them. I felt that I was capable of exemplifying the virtues of friendship better than most people (because I should always place the good of my friends before those personal interests to which other people were devoted but which did not count for me), but not of finding happiness in a feeling which, instead of multiplying the differences that there were between my nature and those of other people — as there are among all of us — would cancel them. At the same time my mind was distinguishing in Saint-Loup a personality more collective than his own, that of the ‘noble’; which like an indwelling spirit moved his limbs, ordered his gestures and his actions; then, at such moments, although in his company, I was as much alone as I should have been gazing at a landscape the harmony of which I could understand. He was no more then than an object the properties of which, in my musing contemplations, I sought to explore. The perpetual discovery in him of this pre-existent, this aeonial creature, this aristocrat who was just what Robert aspired not to be, gave me a keen delight, but one that was intellectual and not social. In the moral and physical agility which gave so much grace to his kindnesses, in the ease with which he offered my grandmother his carriage and made her get into it, in the alacrity with which he sprang from the box, when he was afraid that I might be cold, to spread his own cloak over my shoulders, I felt not only the inherited litheness of the mighty hunters who had been for generations the ancestors of this young man who made no pretence save to intellectuality, their scorn of wealth which, subsisting in him side by side with his enjoyment of it simply because it enabled him to entertain his friends more lavishly, made him so carelessly shower his riches at their feet; I felt in him especially the certainty or the illusion in the minds of those great lords of being ‘better than other people,’ thanks to which they had not been able to hand down to Saint-Loup that anxiety to shew that one is ‘just as good that dread of seeming inferior, of which he was indeed wholly unconscious, but which mars with so much ugliness, so much awkwardness, the most sincere overtures of a plebeian. Sometimes I found fault with myself for thus taking pleasure in my friend as in a work of art, that is to say in regarding the play of all the parts of his being as harmoniously ordered by a general idea from which they depended but which he did not know, so that it added nothing to his own good qualities, to that personal value, intellectual and moral, to which he attached so high a price

   And yet that idea was to a certain extent their determining cause. It was because he was a gentleman that that mental activity, those socialist aspirations, which made him seek the company of young students, arrogant and ill-dressed, connoted in him something really pure and disinterested which was not to be found in them. Looking upon himself as the heir of an ignorant and selfish caste, he was sincerely anxious that they should forgive in him that aristocratic origin which they, on the contrary, found irresistibly attractive and on account of which they sought to know him, though with a show of coldness and indeed of insolence towards him. He was thus led to make advances to people from whom my parents, faithful to the sociological theories of Combray, would have been stupefied at his not turning away in disgust. One day when we were sitting on the sands, Saint-Loup and I, we heard issuing from a canvas tent against which we were leaning a torrent of imprecation against the swarm of Israelites that infested Balbec. “You can’t go a yard without meeting them,” said the voice. “I am not in principle irremediably hostile to the Jewish nation, but here there is a plethora of them. You hear nothing but, ‘I thay, Apraham, I’ve chust theen Chacop.’ You would think you were in the Rue d’Abou-kir.” The man who thus inveighed against Israel emerged at last from the tent; we raised our eyes to behold this anti-Semite. It was my old friend Bloch. Saint-Loup at once begged me to remind him that they had met before the Board of Examiners, when Bloch had carried off the prize of honour, and since then at a popular university course

   At the most I may have smiled now and then, to discover in Robert the marks of his Jesuit schooling, in the awkwardness which the fear of hurting people’s feelings at once created in him whenever one of his intellectual friends made a social error, did something silly to which Saint-Loup himself attached no importance but felt that the other would have blushed if anybody had noticed it. And it was Robert who used to blush as though it had been he that was to blame, for instance on the day when Bloch, after promising to come and see him at the hotel, went on:

    “As I cannot endure to be kept waiting among all the false splendour of these great caravanserais, and the Hungarian band would make me ill, you must tell the ‘lighft-boy’ to make them shut up, and to let you know at once.”

   Personally, I was not particularly anxious that Bloch should come to the hotel. He was at Balbec not by himself, unfortunately, but with his sisters, and they in turn had innumerable relatives and friends staying there. Now this Jewish colony was more picturesque than pleasant. Balbec was in this respect like such countries as Russia or Rumania, where the geography books teach us that the Israelite population does not enjoy anything approaching the same esteem and has not reached the same stage of assimilation as, for instance, in Paris. Always together, with no blend of any other element, when the cousins and uncles of Bloch or their coreligionists male or female repaired to the Casino, the ladies to dance, the gentlemen branching off towards the baccarat-tables, they formed a solid troop, homogeneous within itself, and utterly dissimilar to the people who watched them go past and found them there again every year without ever exchanging a word or a sign with them, whether these were on the Cambremers’ list, or the presiding magistrate’s little group, professional or ‘business’ people, or even simple corn-chandlers from Paris, whose daughters, handsome, proud, derisive and French as the statues at Rheims, would not care to mix with that horde of ill-bred tomboys, who carried their zeal for ‘seaside fashions’ so far as to be always apparently on their way home from shrimping or out to dance the tango. As for the men, despite the brilliance of their dinner-jackets and patent-leather shoes, the exaggeration of their type made one think of what people call the ‘intelligent research’ of painters who, having to illustrate the Gospels or the Arabian Nights, consider the country in which the scenes are laid, and give to Saint Peter or to Ali-Baba the identical features of the heaviest ‘punter’ at the Balbec tables. Bloch introduced his sisters, who, though he silenced their chatter with the utmost rudeness, screamed with laughter at the mildest sallies of this brother, their blindly worshipped idol. So that it is probable that this set of people contained, like every other, perhaps more than any other, plenty of attractions, merits and virtues. But in order to experience these, one had first to penetrate its enclosure. Now it was not popular; it could feel this; it saw in its unpopularity the mark of an anti-semitism to which it presented a bold front in a compact and closed phalanx into which, as it happened, no one ever dreamed of trying to make his way

   At his use of the word ‘lighft’ I had all the less reason to be surprised in that, a few days before, Bloch having asked me why I had come to Balbec (although it seemed to him perfectly natural that he himself should be there) and whether it had been “in the hope of making grand friends,” when I had explained to him that this visit was a fulfilment of one of my earliest longings, though one not so deep as my longing to see Venice, he had replied: “Yes, of course, to sip iced drinks with the pretty ladies, while you pretend to be reading the Stones of Venighce, by Lord John Ruskin, a dreary shaver, in fact one of the most garrulous old barbers that you could find.” So that Bloch evidently thought that in England not only were all the inhabitants of the male sex called ‘Lord,’ but the letter ‘i’ was invariably pronounced ‘igh.’ As for Saint-Loup, this mistake in pronunciation seemed to him all the less serious inasmuch as he saw in it pre-eminently a want of those almost ‘society’ notions which my new friend despised as fully as he was versed in them. But the fear lest Bloch, discovering one day that one says ‘Venice’ and that Ruskin was not a lord, should retrospectively imagine that Robert had been laughing at him, made the latter feel as guilty as if he had been found wanting in the indulgence with which, as we have seen, he overflowed, so that the blush which would no doubt one day dye the cheek of Bloch on the discovery of his error, Robert already, by anticipation and reflex action, could feel mounting to his own. For he fully believed that Bloch attached more importance than he to this mistake. Which Bloch proved to be true some time later, when he heard me pronounce the word ‘lift,’ by breaking in with:

    “Oh, you say ‘lift,’ do you?” And then, in a dry and lofty tone: “Not that it is of the slightest importance.” A phrase that is like a reflex action of the body, the same in all men whose self-esteem is great, in the gravest circumstances as well as in the most trivial, betraying there as clearly as on this occasion how important the thing in question seems to him who declares that it is of no importance; a tragic phrase at times, the first to escape (and then how heart-breaking) the lips of every man at all proud from whom we have just taken the last hope to which he still clung by refusing to do him a service. “Oh, well, it’s not of the slightest importance; I shall make some other arrangement:” the other arrangement which it is not of the slightest importance that he should be driven to adopt being often suicide

   Apart from this, Bloch made me the prettiest speeches. He was certainly anxious to be on the best of terms with me. And yet he asked me: “Is it because you’ve taken a fancy to raise yourself to the peerage that you run after de Saint-Loup-en-Bray? You must be going through a fine crisis of snobbery. Tell me, are you a snob? I think so, what?” Not that his desire to be friendly had suddenly changed. But what is called, in not too correct language, ‘ill breeding’ was his defect, and therefore the defect which he was bound to overlook, all the more that by which he did not believe that other people could be shocked. In the human race the frequency of the virtues that are identical in us all is not more wonderful than the multiplicity of the defects that are peculiar to each one of us. Undoubtedly, it is not common sense that is “the commonest thing in the world”; but human kindness. In the most distant, the most desolate ends of the earth, we marvel to see it blossom of its own accord, as in a remote valley a poppy like the poppies in the world beyond, poppies which it has never seen as it has never known aught but the wind that, now and again, stirring the folds of its scarlet cloak, disturbs its solitude. Even if this human kindness, paralysed by self-interest, is not exercised, it exists none the less, and whenever any inconstant egoist does not restrain its action, when, for example, he is reading a novel or a newspaper, it will bud, blossom, grow, even in the heart of him who, cold-blooded in real life, has retained a tender heart, as a lover of fiction, for the weak, the righteous and the persecuted. But the variety of our defects is no less remarkable than the similarity of our virtues. Each of us has his own, so much so that to continue loving him we are obliged not to take them into account but to ignore them and look only to the rest of his character. The most perfect person in the world has a certain defect which shocks us or makes us angry. One man is of rare intelligence, sees everything from an exalted angle, never speaks evil of anyone, but will pocket and forget letters of supreme importance which it was he himself who asked you to let him post for you, and will then miss a vital engagement without offering you any excuse, with a smile, because he prides himself upon never knowing the time. Another is so refined, so gentle, so delicate in his conduct that he never says anything about you before your face except what you are glad to hear; but you feel that he refrains from uttering, that he keeps buried in his heart, where they grow bitter, very different opinions, and the pleasure that he derives from seeing you is so dear to him that he will let you faint with exhaustion sooner than leave you to yourself. A third has more sincerity, but carries it so far that he feels bound to let you know, when you have pleaded the state of your health as an excuse for not having been to see him, that you were seen going to the theatre and were reported to be looking well, or else that he has not been able to profit entirely by the action which you have taken on his behalf, which, by the way, three other of his friends had already offered to take, so that he is only moderately indebted to you. In similar circumstances the previous friend would have pretended not to know that you had gone to the theatre, or that other people could have done him the same service. But this last friend feels himself obliged to repeat or to reveal to somebody the very thing that is most likely to give offence; is delighted with his own frankness and tells you, emphatically: “I am like that.” While others infuriate you by their exaggerated curiosity, or by a want of curiosity so absolute that you can speak to them of the most sensational happenings without their grasping what it is all about; and others again take months to answer you if your letter has been about something that concerns yourself and not them, or else, if they write that they are coming to ask you for something and you dare not leave the house for fear of missing them, do not appear, but leave you in suspense for weeks because, not having received from you the answer which their letter did not in the least ‘expect,’ they have concluded that you must be cross with them. And others, considering their own wishes and not yours, talk to you without letting you get a word in if they are in good spirits and want to see you, however urgent the work you may have in hand, but if they feel exhausted by the weather or out of humour, you cannot get a word out of them, they meet your efforts with an inert languor and no more take the trouble to reply, even in monosyllables, to what you say to them than if they had not heard you. Each of our friends has his defects so markedly that to continue to love him we are obliged to seek consolation for those defects — in the thought of his talent, his goodness, his affection for ourself — or rather to leave them out of account, and for that we need to display all our good will. Unfortunately our obliging obstinacy in refusing to see the defect in our friend is surpassed by the obstinacy with which he persists in that defect, from his own blindness to it or the blindness that he attributes to other people. For he does not notice it himself, or imagines that it is not noticed. Since the risk of giving offence arises principally from the difficulty of appreciating what does and what does not pass unperceived, we ought, at least, from prudence, never to speak of ourselves, because that is a subject on which we may be sure that other people’s views are never in accordance with our own. If we find as many surprises as on visiting a house of plain exterior which inside is full of hidden treasures, torture-chambers, skeletons, when we discover the true lives of other people, the real beneath the apparent universe, we are no less surprised if, in place of the image that we have made of ourself with the help of all the things that people have said to us, we learn from the terms in which they speak of us in our absence what an entirely different image they have been carrying in their own minds of us and of our life. So that whenever we have spoken about ourselves, we may be sure that our inoffensive and prudent words, listened to with apparent politeness and hypocritical approbation, have given rise afterwards to the most exasperated or the most mirthful, but in either case the least favourable, criticism. The least risk that we run is that of irritating people by the disproportion that there is between our idea of ourselves and the words that we use, a disproportion which as a rule makes people’s talk about themselves as ludicrous as the performances of those self-styled music-lovers who when they feel the need to hum a favourite melody compensate for the inadequacy of their inarticulate murmurings by a strenuous mimicry and a look of admiration which is hardly justified by all that they let us hear. And to the bad habit of speaking about oneself and one’s defects there must be added, as part of the same thing, that habit of denouncing in other people defects precisely analogous to one’s own. For it is always of those defects that people speak, as though it were a way of speaking about oneself, indirectly, which added to the pleasure of absolution that of confession. Besides it seems that our attention, always attracted by what is characteristic of ourselves, notices that more than anything else in other people. One short-sighted man says of another: “But he can scarcely open his eyes!”; a consumptive has his doubts as to the pulmonary integrity of the most robust; an unwashed man speaks only of the baths that other people do not take; an evil-smelling man insists that other people smell; a cuckold sees cuckolds everywhere, a light woman light women, a snob snobs. Then, too, every vice, like every profession, requires and trains a special knowledge which we are never loath to display. The invert detects and denounces inverts; the tailor asked out to dine, before he has begun to talk to you, has passed judgment on the cloth of your coat, which his fingers are itching to feel, and if after a few words of conversation you were to ask a dentist what he really thought of you, he would tell you how many of your teeth wanted filling. To him nothing appears more important, nor more absurd to you who have noticed his own. And it is not only when we speak of ourselves that we imagine other people to be blind; we behave as though they were. On every one of us there is a special god in attendance who hides from him or promises him the concealment from other people of his defect, just as he stops the eyes and nostrils of people who do not wash to the streaks of dirt which they carry in their ears and the smell of sweat which emanates from their armpits, and assures them that they can with impunity carry both of these about a world that will notice nothing. And those who wear artificial pearls, or give them as presents, imagine that people will take them to be genuine. Bloch was ill-bred, neurotic, a snob, and, since he belonged to a family of little repute, had to support, as on the floor of ocean, the incalculable pressure that was imposed on him not only by the Christians upon the surface but by all the intervening layers of Jewish castes superior to his own, each of them crushing with its contempt the one that was immediately beneath it. To carve his way through to the open air by raising himself from Jewish family to Jewish family would have taken Bloch many thousands of years. It was better worth his while to seek an outlet in another direction

   When Bloch spoke to me of the crisis of snobbery through which I must be passing, and bade me confess that I was a snob, I might well have replied: “If I were, I should not be going about with you.” I said merely that he was not being very polite. Then he tried to apologise, but in the way that is typical of the ill-bred man who is only too glad to hark back to whatever it was if he can find an opportunity to aggravate his offence. “Forgive me,” he used now to plead, whenever we met, “I have vexed you, tormented you; I have been wantonly mischievous. And yet — man in general and your friend in particular is so singular an animal — you cannot imagine the affection that I, I who tease you so cruelly, have for you. It carries me often, when I think of you, to tears.” And he gave an audible sob

   What astonished me more in Bloch than his bad manners was to find how the quality of his conversation varied. This youth, so hard to please that of authors who were at the height of their fame he would say: “He’s a gloomy idiot; he’s a sheer imbecile,” would every now and then tell, with immense gusto, stories that were simply not funny or would instance as a ‘really remarkable person’ some man who was completely insignificant. This double scale of measuring the wit, the worth, the interest of people continued to puzzle me until I was introduced to M. Bloch, senior

   I had not supposed that we should ever be allowed to know him, for Bloch junior had spoken ill of me to Saint-Loup and of Saint-Loup to me. In particular, he had said to Robert that I was (always) a frightful snob. “Yes, really, he is overjoyed at knowing M. LLLLegrandin.” This trick of isolating a word, was, in Bloch, a sign at once of irony and of learning. Saint-Loup, who had never heard the name of Legrandin, was bewildered. “But who is he?” “Oh, he’s a bit of all right, he is!” Bloch laughed, thrusting his hands into his pockets as though for warmth, convinced that he was at that moment engaged in contemplation of the picturesque aspect of an extraordinary country gentleman compared to whom those of Barbey d’Aurevilly were as nothing. He consoled himself for his inability to portray M. Legrandin by giving him a string of capital L’s, smacking his lips over the name as over a wine from the farthest bin. But these subjective enjoyments remained hidden from other people. If he spoke ill of me to Saint-Loup he made up for it by speaking no less ill of Saint-Loup to me. We had each of us learned these slanders in detail, the next day, not that we repeated them to each other, a thing which would have seemed to us very wrong, but to Bloch appeared so natural and almost inevitable that in his natural anxiety, in the certainty moreover that he would be telling us only what each of us was bound sooner or later to know, he preferred to anticipate the disclosure and, taking Saint-Loup aside, admitted that he had spoken ill of him, on purpose, so that it might be repeated to him, swore to him “by Zeus Kronion, binder of oaths” that he loved him dearly, that he would lay down his life for him; and wiped away a tear. The same day, he contrived to see me alone, made his confession, declared that he had acted in my interest, because he felt that a certain kind of social intercourse was fatal to me and that I was ‘worthy of better things.’ Then, clasping me by the hand, with the sentimentality of a drunkard, albeit his drunkenness was purely nervous: “Believe me,” he said, “and may the black Ker seize me this instant and bear me across the portals of Hades, hateful to men, if yesterday, when I thought of you, of Combray, of my boundless affection for you, of afternoon hours in class which you do not even remember, I did not lie awake weeping all night long. Yes, all night long, I swear it, and alas, I know — for I know the human soul — you will not believe me.” I did indeed ‘not believe’ him, and to his words which, I felt, he was making up on the spur of the moment, and expanding as he went on, his swearing ‘by Ker’ added no great weight, the Hellenic cult being in Bloch purely literary. Besides, whenever he began to grow sentimental and wished his hearer to grow sentimental over a falsehood, he would say: “I swear it,” more for the hysterical satisfaction of lying than to make people think that he was speaking the truth. I did not believe what he was saying, but I bore him no ill-will for that, for I had inherited from my mother and grandmother their incapacity for resentment even of far worse offenders, and their habit of never condemning anyone

   Besides, he was not altogether a bad youth, this Bloch; he could be, and was at times quite charming. And now that the race of Combray, the race from which sprang creatures absolutely unspoiled like my grandmother and mother, seems almost extinct, as I have hardly any choice now save between honest brutes — insensible and loyal, in whom the mere sound of their voices shews at once that they take absolutely no interest in one’s life — and another kind of men who so long as they are with one understand one, cherish one, grow sentimental even to tears, take — their revenge a few hours later by making some cruel joke at one’s expense, but return to one, always just as comprehending, as charming, as closely assimilated, for the moment, to oneself, I think that it is of this latter sort that I prefer if not the moral worth at any rate the society

    “You cannot imagine my grief when I think of you,” Bloch went on. “When you come to think of it, it is a rather Jewish side of my nature,” he added ironically, contracting his pupils as though he had to prepare for the microscope an infinitesimal quantity of ‘Jewish blood,’ and as might (but never would) have said a great French noble who among his ancestors, all Christian, might nevertheless have included Samuel Bernard, or further still, the Blessed Virgin from whom, it is said, the Levy family claim descent, “coming out. I rather like,” he continued, “to find room among my feelings for the share (not that it is more than a very tiny share) which may be ascribed to my Jewish origin.” He made this statement because it seemed to him at once clever and courageous to speak the truth about his race, a truth which at the same time he managed to water down to a remarkable extent, like misers who decide to pay their debts but have not the courage to pay more than half. This kind of deceit which consists in having the boldness to proclaim the truth, but only after mixing with it an ample measure of lies which falsify it, is commoner than people think, and even among those who do not habitually practise it certain crises in life, especially those in which love is at stake, give them an opportunity of taking to it

   All these confidential diatribes by Bloch to Saint-Loup against me and to me against Saint-Loup ended in an invitation to dinner. I am by no means sure that he did not first make an attempt to secure Saint-Loup by himself. It would have been so like Bloch to do so that probably he did; but if so success did not crown his effort, for it was to myself and Saint-Loup that Bloch said one day: “Dear master, and you, O horseman beloved of Ares, de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, tamer of horses, since I have encountered you by the shore of Amphitrite, resounding with foam, hard by the tents of the swift-shipped Méniers, will both of you come to dinner any day this week with my illustrious sire, of blameless heart?” He proffered this invitation because he desired to attach himself more closely to Saint-Loup who would, he hoped, secure him the right of entry into aristocratic circles. Formed by me for myself, this ambition would have seemed to Bloch the mark of the most hideous snobbishness, quite in keeping with the opinion that he already held of a whole side of my nature which he did not regard — or at least had not hitherto regarded — as its most important side; but the same ambition in himself seemed to him the proof of a finely developed curiosity in a mind anxious to carry out certain social explorations from which he might perhaps glean some literary benefit. M. Bloch senior, when his son had told him that he was going to bring one of his friends in to dinner, and had in a sarcastic but satisfied tone enunciated the name and title of that friend: “The Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,” had been thrown into great commotion. “The Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray! I’ll be jiggered!” he had exclaimed, using the oath which was with him the strongest indication of social deference. And he cast at a son capable of having formed such an acquaintance an admiring glance which seemed to say: “Really, it is astounding. Can this prodigy be indeed a child of mine?” which gave my friend as much pleasure as if his monthly allowance had been increased by fifty francs. For Bloch was not in his element at home and felt that his father treated him like a lost sheep because of his lifelong admiration for Leconte de Lisle, Heredia and other ‘Bohemians.’ But to have got to know Saint-Loup-en-Bray, whose father had been chairman of the Suez Canal board (‘I’ll be jiggered!’) was an indisputable ‘score.’ What a pity, indeed, that they had left in Paris, for fear of its being broken on the journey, the stereoscope. Alone among men, M. Bloch senior had the art, or at least the right to exhibit it. He did this, moreover, on rare occasions only, and then to good purpose, on evenings when there was a full-dress affair, with hired waiters. So that from these exhibitions of the stereoscope there emanated, for those who were present, as it were a special distinction, a privileged position, and for the master of the house who gave them a reputation such as talent confers on a man — which could not have been greater had the photographs been taken by M. Bloch himself and the machine his own invention. “You weren’t invited to Solomon’s yesterday?” one of the family would ask another. “No! I was not one of the elect. What was on?” “Oh, a great how-d’ye-do, the stereoscope, the whole box of tricks!” “Indeed! If they had the stereoscope I’m sorry I wasn’t there; they say Solomon is quite amazing when he works it.”—“It can’t be helped;” said M. Bloch now to his son, “it’s a mistake to let him have everything at once; that would leave him nothing to look forward to.” He had actually thought, in his paternal affection and in the hope of touching his son’s heart, of sending for the instrument. But there was not time, or rather they had thought there would not be; for we were obliged to put off the dinner because Saint-Loup could not leave the hotel, where he was waiting for an uncle who was coming to spend a few days with Mme. de Villeparisis. Since — for he was greatly addicted to physical culture, and especially to long walks — it was largely on foot, spending the night in wayside farms, that this uncle was to make the journey from the country house in which he was staying, the precise date of his arrival at Balbec was by no means certain. And Saint-Loup, afraid to stir out of doors, even entrusted me with the duty of taking to Incauville, where the nearest telegraph-office was, the messages that he sent every day to his mistress. The uncle for whom we were waiting was called Palamède, a name that had come down to him from his ancestors, the Princes of Sicily. And later on when I found, as I read history, belonging to this or that Podestà or Prince of the Church, the same Christian name, a fine renaissance medal — some said, a genuine antique — that had always remained in the family, having passed from generation to generation, from the Vatican cabinet to the uncle of my friend, I felt the pleasure that is reserved for those who, unable from lack of means to start a case of medals, or a picture gallery, look out for old names (names of localities, instructive and picturesque as an old map, a bird’s-eye view, a sign-board or a return of customs; baptismal names, in which rings out and is plainly heard, in their fine French endings, the defect of speech, the intonation of a racial vulgarity, the vicious pronunciation by which our ancestors made Latin and Saxon words undergo lasting mutilations which in due course became the august law-givers of our grammar books) and, in short, by drawing upon their collections of ancient and sonorous words, give themselves concerts like the people who acquire viols da gamba and viols d’amour so as to perform the music of days gone by upon old-fashioned instruments. Saint-Loup told me that even in the most exclusive aristocratic society his uncle Palamède had the further distinction of being particularly difficult to approach, contemptuous, double-dyed in his nobility, forming with his brother’s wife and a few other chosen spirits what was known as the Phoenix Club. There even his insolence was so much dreaded that it had happened more than once that people of good position who had been anxious to meet him and had applied to his own brother for an introduction had met with a refusal: “Really, you mustn’t ask me to introduce you to my brother Palamède. My wife and I, we would all of us do our best for you, but it would be no good. Besides, there’s always the danger of his being rude to you, and I shouldn’t like that.” At the Jockey Club he had, with a few of his friends, marked a list of two hundred members whom they would never allow to be introduced to them. And in the Comte de Paris’s circle he was known by the nickname of ‘The Prince’ because of his distinction and his pride

   Saint-Loup told me about his uncle’s early life, now a long time ago. Every day he used to take women to a bachelor establishment which he shared with two of his friends, as good-looking as himself, on account of which they were known as ‘The Three Graces.’

    “One day, a man who just now is very much in the eye, as Balzac would say, of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but who at a rather awkward period of his early life displayed odd tastes, asked my uncle to let him come to this place. But no sooner had he arrived than it was not to the ladies but to my uncle Palamède that he began to make overtures. My uncle pretended not to understand, made an excuse to send for his two friends; they appeared on the scene, seized the offender, stripped him, thrashed him till he bled, and then with twenty degrees of frost outside kicked him into the street where he was found more dead than alive; so much so that the police started an inquiry which the poor devil had the greatest difficulty in getting them to abandon. My uncle would never go in for such drastic methods now, in fact you can’t conceive the number of men of humble position that he, who is so haughty with people in society, has shewn his affection, taken under his wing, even if he is paid for it with ingratitude. It may be a servant who has looked after him in a hotel, for whom he will find a place in Paris, or a farm-labourer whom he will pay to have taught a trade. That is really the rather nice side of his character, in contrast to his social side.” Saint-Loup indeed belonged to that type of young men of fashion, situated at an altitude at which it has been possible to cultivate such expressions as: “What is really rather nice about him,” “His rather nice side,” precious seeds which produce very rapidly a way of looking at things in which one counts oneself as nothing and the ‘people’ as everything; the exact opposite, in a word, of plebeian pride. “It seems, it is quite impossible to imagine how he set the tone, how he laid down the law for the whole of society when he was a young man. He acted entirely for himself; in any circumstances he did what seemed pleasing to himself, what was most convenient, but at once the snobs would start copying him. If he felt thirsty at the play, and sent out from his box for a drink, the little sitting-rooms behind all the boxes would be filled, a week later, with refreshments. One wet summer, when he had a touch of rheumatism, he ordered an ulster of a loose but warm vicuna wool, which is used only for travelling rugs, and kept the blue and orange stripes shewing. The big tailors at once received orders from all their customers for blue and orange ulsters of rough wool. If he had some reason for wishing to keep every trace of ceremony out of a dinner in a country house where he was spending the day, and to point the distinction had come without evening clothes and sat down to table in the suit he had been wearing that afternoon, it became the fashion, when you were dining in the country, not to dress. If he was eating some special sweet and instead of taking his spoon used a knife, or a special implement of his own invention which he had had made for him by a silversmith, or his fingers, it at once became wrong to eat it in any other way. He wanted once to hear some Beethoven quartets again (for with all his preposterous ideas he is no fool, mind, he has great gifts) and arranged for some musicians to come and play them to him and a few friends once a week. The ultra-fashionable thing that season was to give quite small parties, with chamber music. I should say he’s not done at all badly out of life. With his looks, he must have had any number of women! I can’t tell you exactly whom, for he is very discreet. But I do know that he was thoroughly unfaithful to my poor aunt. Not that that prevented his being always perfectly charming to her, and her adoring him; he was in mourning for her for years. When he is in Paris, he still goes to the cemetery nearly every day.”

   The morning after Robert had told me all these things about his uncle, while he waited for him (and waited, as it happened, in vain), as I was coming by myself past the Casino on my way back to the hotel, I had the sensation of being watched by somebody who was not far off. I turned my head and saw a man of about forty, very tall and rather stout, with a very dark moustache, who, nervously slapping the leg of his trousers with a switch, kept fastened upon me a pair of eyes dilated with observation. Every now and then those eyes were shot through by a look of intense activity such as the sight of a person whom they do not know excites only in men to whom, for whatever reason, it suggests thoughts that would not occur to anyone else — madmen, for instance, or spies. He trained upon me a supreme stare at once bold, prudent, rapid and profound, like a last shot which one fires at an enemy at the moment when one turns to flee, and, after first looking all round him, suddenly adopting an absent and lofty air, by an abrupt revolution of his whole body turned to examine a playbill on the wall in the reading of which he became absorbed, while he hummed a tune and fingered the moss-rose in his buttonhole. He drew from his pocket a note-book in which he appeared to be taking down the title of the performance that was announced, looked two or three times at his watch, pulled down over his eyes a black straw hat the brim of which he extended with his hand held out over it like a visor, as though to see whether some one were at last coming, made the perfunctory gesture of annoyance by which people mean to shew that they have waited long enough, although they never make it when they are really waiting, then pushing back his hat and exposing a scalp cropped close except at the sides where he allowed a pair of waved ‘pigeon’s-wings’ to grow quite long, he emitted the loud panting breath that people give who are not feeling too hot but would like it to be thought that they were. He gave me the impression of a ‘hotel crook’ who had been watching my grandmother and myself for some days, and while he was planning to rob us had just discovered that I had surprised him in the act of spying; to put me off the scent, perhaps he was seeking only, by his new attitude, to express boredom and detachment, but it was with an exaggeration so aggressive that his object appeared to be — at least as much as the dissipating of the suspicions that I must have had of him — to avenge a humiliation which quite unconsciously I must have inflicted on him, to give me the idea not so much that he had not seen me as that I was an object of too little importance to attract his attention. He threw back his shoulders with an air of bravado, bit his lips, pushed up his moustache, and in the lens of his eyes made an adjustment of something that was indifferent, harsh, almost insulting. So effectively that the singularity of his expression made me take him at one moment for a thief and at another for a lunatic. And yet his scrupulously ordered attire was far more sober and far more simple than that of any of the summer visitors I saw at Balbec, and gave a reassurance to my own suit, so often humiliated by the dazzling and commonplace whiteness of their holiday garb. But my grandmother was coming towards me, we took a turn together, and I was waiting for her, an hour later, outside the hotel into which she had gone for a moment, when I saw emerge from it Mme. de Villeparisis with Robert de Saint-Loup and the stranger who had stared at me so intently outside the Casino. Swift as a lightning-flash his look shot through me, just as at the moment when I first noticed him, and returned, as though he had not seen me, to hover, slightly lowered, before his eyes, dulled, like the neutral look which feigns to see nothing without and is incapable of reporting anything to the mind within, the look which expresses merely the satisfaction of feeling round it the eyelids which it cleaves apart with its sanctimonious roundness, the devout, the steeped look that we see on the faces of certain hypocrites, the smug look on those of certain fools. I saw that he had changed his clothes. The suit he was wearing was darker even than the other; and no doubt this was because the true distinction in dress lies nearer to simplicity than the false; but there was something more; when one came near him one felt that if colour was almost entirely absent from these garments it was not because he who had banished it from them was indifferent to it but rather because for some reason he forbade himself the enjoyment of it. And the sobriety which they displayed seemed to be of the kind that comes from obedience to a rule of diet rather than from want of appetite. A dark green thread harmonised, in the stuff of his trousers, with the clock on his socks, with a refinement which betrayed the vivacity of a taste that was everywhere else conquered, to which this single concession had been made out of tolerance for such a weakness, while a spot of red on his necktie was imperceptible, like a liberty which one dares not take

    “How are you? Let me introduce my nephew, the Baron de Guermantes,” Mme. de Villeparisis greeted me, while the stranger without looking at me, muttering a vague “Charmed!” which he followed with a “H’m, h’m, h’m” to give his affability an air of having been forced, and doubling back his little finger, forefinger and thumb, held out to me his middle and ring fingers, the latter bare of any ring, which I clasped through his suede glove; then, without lifting his eyes to my face, he turned towards Mme. de Villeparisis

    “Good gracious; I shall be forgetting my own name next!” she exclaimed. “Here am I calling you Baron de Guermantes. Let me introduce the Baron de Charlus. After all, it’s not a very serious mistake,” she went on, “for you’re a thorough Guermantes whatever else you are.”

   By this time my grandmother had reappeared, and we all set out together. Saint-Loup’s uncle declined to honour me not only with a word, with so much as a look, even, in my direction. If he stared strangers out of countenance (and during this short excursion he two or three times hurled his terrible and searching scrutiny like a sounding lead at insignificant people of obviously humble extraction who happened to pass), to make up for that he never for a moment, if I was to judge by myself, looked at the people whom he did know, just as a detective on special duty might except his personal friends from his professional vigilance. Leaving them — my grandmother, Mme. de Villeparisis and him — to talk to one another, I fell behind with Saint-Loup

    “Tell me, am I right in thinking I heard Mme. de Villeparisis say just now to your uncle that he was a Guermantes?”

    “Of course he is; Palamède de Guermantes.”

    “Not the same Guermantes who have a place near Combray, and claim descent from Geneviève de Brabant?”

    “Most certainly: my uncle, who is the very last word in heraldry and all that sort of thing, would tell you that our ‘cry,’ our war-cry, that is to say, which was changed afterwards to ‘Passavant’ was originally ‘Combraysis,’” he said, smiling so as not to appear to be priding himself on this prerogative of a ‘cry,’ which only the semi-royal houses, the great chiefs of feudal bands enjoyed. “It’s his brother who has the place now.”

   And so she was indeed related, and quite closely, to the Guermantes, this Mme. de Villeparisis who had so long been for me the lady who had given me a duck filled with chocolates, when I was little, more remote then from the Guermantes way than if she had been shut up somewhere on the Méséglise, less brilliant, less highly placed by me than was the Combray optician, and who now suddenly went through one of those fantastic rises in value, parallel to the depreciations, no less unforeseen, of other objects in our possession, which — rise and fall alike — introduce in our youth and in those periods of our life in which a trace of youth persists changes as numerous as the Metamorphoses of Ovid

    “Haven’t they got, down there, the busts of all the old lords of Guermantes?”

    “Yes; and a lovely sight they are!” Saint-Loup was ironical. “Between you and me, I look on all that sort of thing as rather a joke. But they have got at Guermantes, what is a little more interesting, and, that is quite a touching portrait of my aunt by Carrière. It’s as fine as Whistler or Velasquez,” went on Saint-Loup, who in his neophyte zeal was not always very exact about degrees of greatness. “There are also some moving pictures by Gustave Moreau. My aunt is the niece of your friend Mme. de Ville-parisis; she was brought up by her, and married her cousin, who was a nephew, too, of my aunt Villeparisis, the present Duc de Guermantes.”

    “Then who is this uncle?”

    “He bears the title of Baron de Charlus. Properly speaking, when my great-uncle died, my uncle Palamède ought to have taken the title of Prince des Laumes, which his brother used before he became Duc de Guermantes, for in that family they change their names as you’d change your shirt. But my uncle has peculiar ideas about all that sort of thing. And as he feels that people are rather apt to overdo the Italian Prince and Grandee of Spain business nowadays, though he had half-a-dozen titles of ‘Prince’ to choose from, he has remained Baron de Charlus, as a protest, and with an apparent simplicity which really covers a good deal of pride. ‘In these days,’ he says, ‘everybody is Prince something-or-other; one really must have a title that will distinguish one; I shall call myself Prince when I wish to travel incognito.’ According to him there is no older title than the Charlus barony; to prove to you that it is earlier than the Montmorency title, though they used to claim, quite wrongly, to be the premier barons of France when they were only premier in the He de France, where their fief was, my uncle will explain to you for hours on end and enjoy doing it, because, although he’s a most intelligent man, really gifted, he regards that sort of thing as quite a live topic of conversation,” Saint-Loup smiled again. “But as I am not like him, you mustn’t ask me to talk pedigrees; I know nothing more deadly, more perishing; really, life is not long enough.”

   I now recognised in the hard look which had made me turn round that morning outside the Casino the same that I had seen fixed on me at Tan-sonville, at the moment when Mme. Swann called Gilberte away

    “But, I say, all those mistresses that, you told me, your uncle M. de Charlus had had, wasn’t Mme. Swann one of them?”

    “Good lord, no! That is to say, my uncle’s a great friend of Swann, and has always stood up for him. But no one has ever suggested that he was his wife’s lover. You would make a great sensation in Paris society if people thought you believed that.”

   I dared not reply that it would have caused an even greater sensation in Combray society if people had thought that I did not believe it

   My grandmother was delighted with M. de Charlus. No doubt he attached an extreme importance to all questions of birth and social position, and my grandmother had remarked this, but without any trace of that severity which as a rule embodies a secret envy and the annoyance of seeing some one else enjoy an advantage which one would like but cannot oneself possess. As on the other hand my grandmother, content with her lot and never for a moment regretting that she did not move in a more brilliant sphere, employed only her intellect in observing the eccentricities of M. de Charlus, she spoke of Saint-Loup’s uncle with that detached, smiling, almost affectionate kindness with which we reward the object of our disinterested study for the pleasure that it has given us, all the more that this time the object was a person with regard to whom she found that his if not legitimate, at any rate picturesque pretensions shewed him in vivid contrast to the people whom she generally had occasion to see. But it was especially in consideration of his intelligence and sensibility, qualities which it was easy to see that M. de Charlus, unlike so many of the people in society whom Saint-Loup derided, possessed in a marked degree, that my grandmother had so readily forgiven him his aristocratic prejudice. And yet this had not been sacrificed by the uncle, as it was by the nephew, to higher qualities. Rather, M. de Charlus had reconciled it with them. Possessing, by virtue of his descent from the Ducs de Nemours and Princes de Lamballe, documents, furniture, tapestries, portraits painted for his ancestors by Raphael, Velasquez, Boucher, justified in saying that he was visiting a museum and a matchless library when he was merely turning over his family relics at home, he placed in the rank from which his nephew had degraded it the whole heritage of the aristocracy. Perhaps also, being less metaphysical than Saint-Loup, less satisfied with words, more of a realist in his study of men, he did not care to neglect a factor that was essential to his prestige in their eyes and, if it gave certain disinterested pleasures to his imagination, could often be a powerfully effective aid to his utilitarian activities. No agreement can ever be reached between men of his sort and those who obey the ideal within them which urges them to strip themselves bare of such advantages so that they may seek only to realise that ideal, similar in that respect to the painters, the writers who renounce their virtuosity, the artistic peoples who modernise themselves, warrior peoples who take the initiative in a move for universal disarmament, absolute governments which turn democratic and repeal their harsh laws, though as often as not the sequel fails to reward their noble effort; for the men lose their talent, the nations their secular predominance; ‘pacificism’ often multiplies wars and indulgence criminality. If Saint-Loup’s efforts towards sincerity and emancipation were only to be commended as most noble, to judge by their visible result, one could still be thankful that they had failed to bear fruit in M. de Charlus, who had transferred to his own home much of the admirable panelling from the Guermantes house, instead of substituting, like his nephew, a ‘modern style’ of decoration, employing Lebourg or Guillaumin. It was none the less true that M. de Charlus’s ideal was highly artificial, and, if the epithet can be applied to the word ideal, as much social as artistic. In certain women of great beauty and rare culture whose ancestresses, two centuries earlier, had shared in all the glory and grace of the old order, he found a distinction which made him take pleasure only in their society, and no doubt the admiration for them which he had protested was sincere, but countless reminiscences; historical and artistic, called forth by their names, entered into and formed a great part of it, just as suggestions of classical antiquity are one of the reasons for the pleasure which a booklover finds in reading an Ode of Horace that is perhaps inferior to poems of our own day which would leave the same booklover cold. Any of these women by the side of a pretty commoner was for him what are, hanging beside a contemporary canvas representing a procession or a wedding, those old pictures the history of which we know, from the Pope or King who ordered them, through the hands of people whose acquisition of them, by gift, purchase, conquest or inheritance, recalls to us some event or at least some alliance of historic interest, and consequently some knowledge that we ourselves have acquired, gives it a fresh utility, increases our sense of the richness of the possessions of our memory or of our erudition. M. de Charlus might be thankful that a prejudice similar to his own, by preventing these several great ladies from mixing with women whose blood was less pure, presented them for his veneration unspoiled, in their unaltered nobility, like an eighteenth-century house-front supported on its flat columns of pink marble, in which the passage of time has wrought no change

   M. de Charlus praised the true ‘nobility’ of mind and heart which characterised these women, playing upon the word in a double sense by which he himself was taken in, and in which lay the falsehood of this bastard conception, of this medley of aristocracy, generosity and art, but also its seductiveness, dangerous to people like my grandmother, to whom the less refined but more innocent prejudice of a nobleman who cared only about quarterings and took no thought for anything besides would have appeared too silly for words, whereas she was defenceless as soon as a thing presented itself under the externals of a mental superiority, so much so, indeed, that she regarded Princes as enviable above all other men because they were able to have a Labruyère, a Fénelon as their tutors. Outside the Grand Hotel the three Guermantes left us; they were going to luncheon with the Princesse de Luxembourg. While my grandmother was saying good-bye to Mme. de Villcparisis and Saint-Loup to my grandmother, M. de Charlus who, so far, had not uttered a word to me, drew back a little way from the group and, when he reached my side, said: “I shall be taking tea this evening after dinner in my aunt Villeparisis’s room; I hope that you will give me the pleasure of seeing you there, and your grandmother.” With which he rejoined the Marquise

   Although it was Sunday there were no more carriages waiting outside the hotel now than at the beginning of the season. The solicitor’s wife, in particular, had decided that it was not worth the expense of hiring one every time simply because she was not going to the Cambremers’, and contented herself with staying in her room

    “Is Mme. Blandais not well?” her husband was asked. “We haven’t seen her all day.”

    “She has a slight headache; it’s the heat, there’s thunder coming. The least thing upsets her; but I expect you will see her this evening; I’ve told her she ought to come down. It can’t do her any harm.”

   I had supposed that in thus inviting us to take tea with his aunt, whom I never doubted that he would have warned that we were coming, M. de Charlus wished to make amends for the impoliteness which he had shewn me during our walk that morning. But when, on our entering Mme. de Villeparisis’s room, I attempted to greet her nephew, even although I walked right round him, while in shrill accents he was telling a somewhat spiteful story about one of his relatives, I did not succeed in catching his eye; I decided to say “Good evening” to him, and fairly loud, to warn him of my presence; but I realised that he had observed it, for before ever a word had passed my lips, just as I began to bow to him, I saw his two fingers stretched out for me to shake without his having turned to look at me or paused in his story. He had evidently seen me, without letting it appear that he had, and I noticed then that his eyes, which were never fixed on the person to whom he was speaking, strayed perpetually in all directions, like those of certain animals when they are frightened, or those of street hawkers who, while they are bawling their patter and displaying their illicit merchandise, keep a sharp look-out, though without turning their heads, on the different points of the horizon from any of which may appear, suddenly, the police. At the same time I was a little surprised to find that Mme. de Villeparisis, while glad to see us, did not seem to have been expecting us, and I was still more surprised to hear M. de Charlus say to my grandmother: “Ah! that was a capital idea of yours to come and pay us a visit; charming of them, is it not, my dear aunt?” No doubt he had noticed his aunt’s surprise at our entry and thought, as a man accustomed to set the tone, to strike the right note, that it would be enough to transform that surprise into joy were he to shew that he himself felt it, that it was indeed the feeling which our arrival there ought to have prompted. In which he calculated wisely; for Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a high opinion of her nephew and knew how difficult it was to please him, appeared suddenly to have found new attractions in my grandmother and continued to make much of her. But I failed to understand how M. de Charlus could, in the space of a few hours, have forgotten the invitation — so curt but apparently so intentional, so premeditated — which he had addressed to me that same morning, or why he called a ‘capital idea’ on my grandmother’s part an idea that had been entirely his own. With a scruple of accuracy which I retained until I had reached the age at which I realised that it is not by asking him questions that one learns the truth of what another man has had in his mind, and that the risk of a misunderstanding which will probably pass unobserved is less than that which may come from a purblind insistence: “But, sir,” I reminded him, “you remember, surely, that it was you who asked me if we would come in this evening?” Not a sound, not a movement betrayed that M. de Charlus had so much as heard my question. Seeing which I repeated it, like a diplomat, or like young men after a misunderstanding who endeavour, with untiring and unrewarded zeal, to obtain an explanation which their adversary is determined not to give them. Still M. de Charlus answered me not a word. I seemed to see hovering upon his lips the smile of those who from a great height pass judgment on the characters and breeding of their inferiors

   Since he refused to give any explanation, I tried to provide one for myself, but succeeded only in hesitating between several, none of which could be the right one. Perhaps he did not remember, or perhaps it was I who had failed to understand what he had said to me that morning. . . . More probably, in his pride, he did not wish to appear to have sought to attract people whom he despised, and preferred to cast upon them the responsibility for their intrusion. But then, if he despised us, why had he been so anxious that we should come, or rather that my grandmother should come, for of the two of us it was to her alone that he spoke that evening, and never once to me. Talking with the utmost animation to her, as also to Mme. de Villeparisis, hiding, so to speak, behind them, as though he were seated at the back of a theatre-box, he contented himself, turning from them every now and then the exploring gaze of his penetrating eyes, with fastening it on my face, with the same gravity, the same air of preoccupation as if my face had been a manuscript difficult to decipher

   No doubt, if he had not had those eyes, the face of M. de Charlus would have been similar to the faces of many good-looking men. And when Saint-Loup, speaking to me of various other Guermantes, on a later occasion, said: “Gad, they’ve not got that thoroughbred air, of being gentlemen to their finger-tips, that uncle Palamède has!” confirming my suspicion that a thoroughbred air and aristocratic distinction were not anything mysterious and new but consisted in elements which I had recognised without difficulty and without receiving any particular impression from them, I was to feel that another of my illusions had been shattered. But that face, to which a faint layer of powder gave almost the appearance of a face on the stage, in vain might M. de Charlus hermetically seal its expression; his eyes were like two crevices, two loopholes which alone he had failed to stop, and through which, according to where one stood or sat in relation to him, one felt suddenly flash across one the glow of some internal engine which seemed to offer no reassurance even to him who without being altogether master of it must carry it inside him, at an unstable equilibrium and always on the point of explosion; and the circumspect and unceasingly restless expression of those eyes, with all the signs of exhaustion which, extending from them to a pair of dark rings quite low down upon his cheeks, were stamped on his face, however carefully he might compose and regulate it, made one think of some incognito, some disguise assumed by a powerful mam in danger, or merely by a dangerous — but tragic — person. I should have liked to divine what was this secret which other men did not carry in their breasts and which had already made M. de Charlus’s gaze so enigmatic to me when I had seen him that morning outside the Casino. But with what I now knew of his family I could no longer believe that they were the eyes of a thief, nor, after what I had heard of his conversation, could I say that they were those of a madman. If he was cold with me, while making himself agreeable to my grandmother, that arose perhaps not from a personal antipathy for, generally speaking, just as he was kindly disposed towards women, of whose faults he used to speak without, as a rule, any narrowing of the broadest tolerance, so he shewed with regard to men, and especially young men, a hatred so violent as to suggest that of certain extreme misogynists for women. Two or three ‘carpet-knights,’ relatives or intimate friends of Saint-Loup who happened to mention their names, M. de Charlus, with an almost ferocious expression, in sharp contrast to his usual coldness, called: “Little cads!” I gathered that the particular fault which he found in the young men of the period was their extreme effeminacy. “They’re absolute women,” he said with scorn. But what life would not have appeared effeminate beside that which he expected a man to lead, and never found energetic or virile enough? (He himself, when he walked across country, after long hours on the road would plunge his heated body into frozen streams.) He would not even allow a man to wear a single ring. But this profession of virility did not prevent his having also the most delicate sensibilities. When Mme. de Villeparisis asked him to describe to my grandmother some country house in which Mme. de Sévigné had stayed, adding that she could not help feeling that there was something rather ‘literary’ about that lady’s distress at being parted from “that tiresome Mme. de Grignan”:

    “On the contrary,” he retorted, “I can think of nothing more true. Besides, it was a time in which feelings of that sort were thoroughly understood. The inhabitant of Lafontaine’s Monomotapa, running to see his friend who had appeared to him in a dream, and had looked sad, the pigeon finding that the greatest of evils is the absence of the other pigeon, seem to you perhaps, my dear aunt, as exaggerated as Mme. de Sévigné‘s impatience for the moment when she will be alone with her daughter. It is so fine what she says when she leaves her: ‘This parting gives a pain to my soul which I feel like an ache in my body. In absence one is liberal with the hours. One anticipates a time for which one is longing.’” My grandmother was in ecstasies at hearing the Letters thus spoken of, exactly as she would have spoken of them herself. She was astonished that a man could understand them so thoroughly. She found in M. de Charlus a delicacy, a sensibility that were quite feminine. We said to each other afterwards, when we were by ourselves and began to discuss him together, that he must have come under the strong influence of a woman, his mother, or in later life his daughter if he had any children. “A mistress, perhaps,” I thought to myself, remembering the influence that Saint-Loup’s seemed to have had over him, which enabled me to realise the point to which men can be refined by the women with whom they live

    “Once she was with her daughter, ^he had probably nothing to say to her,” put in Mme. de Villeparisis

    “Most certainly she had: if it was only what she calls ‘things so slight that nobody else would notice them but you and me.’ And anyhow she was with her. And Labruyère tells us that that is everything. ‘To be with the people one loves, to speak to them, not to speak to them, it is all the same.’ He is right; that is the only form of happiness,” added M. de Charlus in a mournful voice, “and that happiness — alas, life is so ill arranged that one very rarely tastes it; Mme. de Sévigné was after all less to be pitied than most of us. She spent a great part of her life with the person whom she loved.”

    “You forget that it was not ‘love’ in her case; the person was her daughter.”

    “But what matters in life is not whom or what one loves,” he went on, in a judicial, peremptory, almost a cutting tone; “it is the fact of loving. What Mme. de Sévigné felt for her daughter has a far better claim to rank with the passion that Racine described in Andromaque or Phèdre than the commonplace relations young Sévigné had with his mistresses. It’s the same with a mystic’s love for his God. The hard and fast lines with which we circumscribe love arise solely from our complete ignorance of life.”

    “You think all that of Andromaque and Phèdre, do you?” Saint-Loup asked his uncle in a faintly contemptuous tone. “There is more truth in a single tragedy of Racine than in all the dramatic works of Monsieur Victor Hugo,” replied M. de Charlus. “People really are overwhelming,” Saint-Loup murmured in my ear. “Preferring Racine to Victor, you may say what you like, it’s epoch-making!” He was genuinely distressed by his uncle’s words, but the satisfaction of saying “you may say what you like” and, better still, “epoch-making” consoled him

   In these reflexions upon the sadness of having to live apart from the person whom one loves (which were to lead my grandmother to say to me that Mme. de Villeparisis’s nephew understood certain things quite as well as his aunt, but in a different way, and moreover had something about him that set him far above the average clubman) M. de Charlus not only allowed a refinement of feeling to appear such as men rarely shew; his voice itself, like certain contralto voices which have not been properly trained to the right pitch, so that when they sing it sounds like a duet between a young man and a woman, singing alternately, mounted, when he expressed these delicate sentiments, to its higher notes, took on an unexpected sweetness and seemed to be embodying choirs of betrothed maidens, of sisters, who poured out the treasures of their love. But the bevy of young girls, whom M. de Charlus in his horror of every kind of effeminacy would have been so distressed to learn that he gave the impression of sheltering thus within his voice, did not confine themselves to the interpretation, the modulation of scraps of sentiment. Often while M. de Charlus was talking one could hear their laughter, shrill, fresh laughter of school-girls or coquettes quizzing their partners with all the archness of clever tongues and pretty wits

   He told us how a house that had belonged to his family, in which Marie Antoinette had slept, with a park laid out by Lenôtre, was now in the hands of the Israels, the wealthy financiers, who had bought it. “Israel — at least that is the name these people go by, which seems to me a generic, a racial term rather than a proper name. One cannot tell; possibly people of that sort do not have names, and are designated only by the collective title of the tribe to which they belong. It is of no importance! But fancy, after being a home of the Guermantes, to belong to Israels!!!” His voice rose. “It reminds me of a room in the Château of Blois where the caretaker who was shewing me over said: ‘This is where Mary Stuart used to say her prayers; I use it to keep my brooms in.’ Naturally I wish to know nothing more of this house that has let itself be dishonoured, any more than of my cousin Clara de Chimay after she left her husband. But I keep a photograph of the house, when it was still unspoiled, just as I keep one of the Princess before her large eyes had learned to gaze on anyone but my cousin. A photograph acquires something of the dignity which it ordinarily lacks when it ceases to be a reproduction of reality and shews us things that no longer exist. I could give you a copy, since you are interested in that style of architecture,” he said to my grandmother. At that moment, noticing that the embroidered handkerchief which he had in his pocket was shewing some coloured threads, he thrust it sharply down out of sight with the scandalised air of a prudish but far from innocent lady concealing attractions which, by an excess of scrupulosity, she regards as indecent. “Would you believe,” he went on, “that the first thing the creatures did was to destroy Lenôtre’s park, which is as bad as slashing a picture by Poussin? For that alone, these Israels ought to be in prison. It is true,” he added with a smile, after a moment’s silence, “that there are probably plenty of other reasons why they should be there! In any case, you can imagine the effect, with that architecture behind it, of an English garden.”

    “But the house is in the same style as the Petit Trianon,” said Mme. de Villeparisis, “and Marie-Antoinette had an English garden laid out there.”

    “Which, all the same, ruins Gabriel’s front,” replied M. de Charlus. “Obviously, it would be an act of vandalism now to destroy the Hameau. But whatever may be the spirit of the age, I doubt, all the same, whether, in that respect, a whim of Mme. Israel has the same importance as the memory of the Queen.”

   Meanwhile my grandmother had been making signs to me to go up to bed, in spite of the urgent appeals of Saint-Loup who, to my utter confusion, had alluded in front of M. de Charlus to the depression that used often to come upon me at night before I went to sleep, which his uncle must regard as betokening a sad want of virility. I lingered a few moments still, then went upstairs, and was greatly surprised when, a little later, having heard a knock at my bedroom door and asked who was there, I heard the voice of M. de Charlus saying dryly:

    “It is Charlus. May I come in, sir? Sir,” he began again in the same tone as soon as he had shut the door, “my nephew was saying just now that you were apt to be worried at night before going to sleep, and also that you were an admirer of Bergotte’s books. As I had one here in my luggage which you probably do not know, I have brought it to help you to while away these moments in which you are not comfortable.”

   I thanked M. de Charlus with some warmth and told him that, on the contrary, I had been afraid that what Saint-Loup had said to him about my discomfort when night came would have made me appear in his eyes more stupid even than I was

    “No; why?” he answered, in a gentler voice. “You have not, perhaps, any personal merit; so few of us have! But for a time at least you have youth, and that is always a charm. Besides, sir, the greatest folly of all is to laugh at or to condemn in others what one does not happen oneself to feel. I love the night, and you tell me that you are afraid of it. I love the scent of roses, and I have a friend whom it throws into a fever. Do you suppose that I think, for that reason, that he is inferior to me? I try to understand everything and I take care to condemn nothing. After all, you must not be too sorry for yourself; I do not say that these moods of depression are not painful, I know that one can be made to suffer by things which the world would not understand. But at least you have placed your affection wisely, in your grandmother. You see a great deal of her. And besides, that is a legitimate affection, I mean one that is repaid. There are so many of which one cannot say that.”

   He began walking up and down the room, looking at one thing, taking up another. I had the impression that he had something to tell me, and could not find the right words to express it

    “I have another volume of Bergotte here; I will fetch it for you,” he went on, and rang the bell. Presently a page came. “Go and find me your head waiter. He is the only person here who is capable of obeying an order intelligently,” said M. de Charlus stiffly. “Monsieur Aimé, sir?” asked the page. “I cannot tell you his name; yes, I remember now, I did hear him called Aimé. Run along, I am in a hurry.” “He won’t be a minute, sir, I saw him downstairs just now,” said the page, anxious to appear efficient. There was an interval of silence. The page returned. “Sir, M. Aimé has gone to bed. But I can take your message.” “No, you have only to get him out of bed.” “But I can’t do that, sir; he doesn’t sleep here.” “Then you can leave us alone.” “But, sir,” I said when the page had gone, “you are too kind; one volume of Bergotte will be quite enough.” “That is just what I was thinking.” M. de Charlus walked up and down the room. Several minutes passed in this way, then after a prolonged hesitation, and several false starts, he swung sharply round and, his voice once more stinging, flung at me: “Good night, sir!” and left the room. After all the lofty sentiments which I had heard him express that evening, next day, which was the day of his departure, on the beach, before noon, when I was on my way down to bathe, and M. de Charlus had come across to tell me that my grandmother was waiting for me to join her as soon as I left the water, I was greatly surprised to hear him say, pinching my neck as he spoke, with a familiarity and a laugh that were frankly vulgar:

    “But he doesn’t give a damn for his old grandmother, does he, eh? Little rascal!”

    “What, sir! I adore her!”

    “Sir,” he said, stepping back a pace, and with a glacial air, “you are still young; you should profit by your youth to learn two things; first, to refrain from expressing sentiments that are too natural not to be taken for granted; and secondly not to dash into speech to reply to things that are said to you before you have penetrated their meaning. If you had taken this precaution a moment ago you would have saved yourself the appearance of speaking at cross-purposes like a deaf man, thereby adding a second absurdity to that of having anchors embroidered on your bathing-dress. I have lent you a book by Bergotte which I require. See that it is brought to me within the next hour by that head waiter with the silly and inappropriate name, who, I suppose, is not in bed at this time of day. You make me see that I was premature in speaking to you last night of the charms of youth; I should have done you a better service had I pointed out to you its thoughtlessness, its inconsequence, and its want of comprehension. I hope, sir, that this little douche will be no less salutary to you than your bathe. But don’t let me keep you standing: you may catch cold. Good day, sir.”

   No doubt he was sorry afterwards for this speech, for some time later I received — in a morocco binding on the front of which was inlaid a panel of tooled leather representing in demi-relief a spray of forget-me-nots — the book which he had lent me, and I had sent back to him, not by Aimé who was apparently ‘off duty,’ but by the lift-boy

   M. de Charlus having gone, Robert and I were free at last to dine with Bloch. And I realised during this little party that the stories too readily admitted by our friend as funny were favourite stories of M. Bloch senior, and that the son’s ‘really remarkable person’ was always one of his father’s friends whom he had so classified. There are a certain number of people whom we admire in our boyhood, a father with better brains than the rest of the family, a teacher who acquires credit in our eyes from the philosophy he reveals to us, a schoolfellow more advanced than we are (which was what Bloch had been to me), who despises the Musset of the Espoir en Dieu when we still admire it, and when we have reached Le-conte or Claudel will be in ecstasies only over:

                         A Saint-Biaise, à la Zuecca
                          Vous étiez, vous étiez bien aise:

With which he will include:

                          Padoue est un fort bel endroit
                          Où de très grands docteurs en droit
                          Mais j’aime mieux la polenta
                          Passe dans mon domino noir
                          La Toppatelle

And of all the Nuits will remember only:

                          Au Havre, devant l’Atlantique
                          A Venise, à l’affreux Lido
                          Où vient sur l’herbe d’un tombeau
                          Mourir la pâle Adriatique

   So, whenever we confidently admire anyone, we collect from him, we quote with admiration sayings vastly inferior to the sort which, left to our own judgment, we would sternly reject, just as the writer of a novel puts into it, on the pretext that they are true, things which people have actually said, which in the living context are like a dead weight, form the dull part of the work. Saint-Simon’s portraits composed by himself (and very likely without his admiring them himself) are admirable, whereas what he cites as the charming wit of his clever friends is frankly dull where it has not become meaningless. He would have scorned to invent what he reports as so pointed or so coloured when said by Mme. Cornuel or Louis XIV, a point which is to be remarked also in many other writers, and is capable of various interpretations, of which it is enough to note but one for the present: namely, that in the state of mind in which we ‘observe’ we are a long way below the level to which we rise when we create

   There was, then, embedded in my friend Bloch a father Bloch who lagged forty years behind his son, told impossible stories and laughed as loudly at them from the heart of my friend as did’ the separate, visible and authentic father Bloch, since to the laugh which the latter emitted, not without several times repeating the last word so that his public might taste the full flavour of the story, was added the braying laugh with which the son never failed, at table, to greet his father’s anecdotes. Thus it came about that after saying the most intelligent things young Bloch, to indicate the portion that he had inherited from his family, would tell us for the thirtieth time some of the gems which father Bloch brought out only (with his swallow-tail coat) on the solemn occasions on which young Bloch brought someone to the house on whom it was worth while making an impression; one of his masters, a ‘chum’ who had taken all the prizes, or, this evening, Saint-Loup and myself. For instance: “A military critic of great insight, who had brilliantly worked out, supporting them with proofs, the reasons for which, in the Russo-Japanese war, the Japanese must inevitably be beaten and the Russians victorious,” or else: “He is an eminent gentleman who passes for a great financier in political circles and for a great politician among financiers.” These stories were interchangeable with one about Baron de Rothschild and one about Sir Rufus Israels, who were brought into the conversation in an equivocal manner which might let it be supposed that M. Bloch knew them personally

   I was myself taken in, and from the way in which M. Bloch spoke of Bergotte I assumed that he too was an old friend. But with him as with all famous people, M. Bloch knew them only ‘without actually knowing them,’ from having seen them at a distance in the theatre or in the street. He imagined, moreover, that his appearance, his name, his personality were not unknown to them, and that when they caught sight of him they had often to repress a stealthy inclination to bow. People in society, because they know men of talent, original characters, and have them to dine in their houses, do not on that account understand them any better. But when one has lived to some extent in society, the silliness of its inhabitants makes one too anxious to live, suppose too high a standard of intelligence in the obscure circles in which people know only ‘without actually knowing.’ I was to discover this when I introduced the topic of Bergotte. M. Bloch was not the only one who was a social success at home. My friend was even more so with his sisters, whom he continually questioned in a hectoring tone, burying his face in his plate, all of which made them laugh until they cried. They had adopted their brother’s language, and spoke it fluently, as if it had been obligatory and the only form of speech that people of intelligence might use. When we arrived, the eldest sister said to one of the younger ones: “Go, tell our sage father and our venerable mother!” “Puppies,” said Bloch, “I present to you the cavalier Saint-Loup, hurler of javelins, who is come for a few days from Doncières to the dwellings of polished stone, fruitful in horses.” And, since he was as vulgar as he was literary, his speech ended as a rule in some pleasantry of a less Homeric kind: “See, draw closer your pepla with fair clasps, what is all that that I see? Does your mother know you’re out?” And the Misses Bloch subsided in a tempest of laughter. I told their brother how much pleasure he had given me by recommending me to read Bergotte, whose books I had loved

   M. Bloch senior, who knew Bergotte only by sight, and Bergotte’s life only from what was common gossip, had a manner quite as indirect of making the acquaintance of his books, by the help of criticisms that were apparently literary. He lived in the world of ‘very nearlies,’ where people salute the empty air and arrive at wrong judgments. Inexactitude, incompetence do not modify their assurance; quite the contrary. It is the propitious miracle of self-esteem that, since few of us are in a position to enjoy the society of distinguished people, or to form intellectual friendships, those to whom they are denied still believe themselves to be the best endowed of men, because the optics of our social perspective make every grade of society seem the best to him who occupies it, and beholds as less favoured than himself, less fortunate and therefore to be pitied, the greater men whom he names and calumniates without knowing, judges and — despises without understanding them. Even in cases where the multiplication of his modest personal advantages by his self-esteem would not suffice to assure a man the dose of happiness, superior to that accorded to others, which is essential to him, envy is always there to make up the balance. It is true that if envy finds expression in scornful phrases, we must translate ‘I have no wish to know him’ by ‘I have no means of knowing him.’ That is the intellectual sense. But the emotional sense is indeed, ‘I have no wish to know him.’ The speaker knows that it is not true, but he does not, all the same, say it simply to deceive; he says it because it is what he feels, and that is sufficient to bridge the gulf between them, that is to say to make him happy

   Self-centredness thus enabling every human being to see the universe spread out in a descending scale beneath himself who is its lord, M. Bloch afforded himself the luxury of being pitiless when in the morning, as he drank his chocolate, seeing Bergotte’s signature at the foot of an article in the newspaper which he had scarcely opened, he disdainfully granted the writer an audience soon cut short, pronounced sentence upon him, and gave himself the comforting pleasure of repeating after every mouthful of the scalding brew: “That fellow Bergotte has become unreadable. My word, what a bore the creature can be. I really must stop my subscription. How involved it all is, bread and butter nonsense!” And he helped himself to another slice

   This illusory importance of M. Bloch senior did, moreover, extend some little way beyond the radius of his own perceptions. In the first place his children regarded him as a superior person. Children have always a tendency either to depreciate or to exalt their parents, and to a good son his father is always the best of fathers, quite apart from any objective reason there may be for admiring him. Now, such reasons were not altogether lacking in the case of M. Bloch, who was an educated man, shrewd, affectionate towards his family. In his most intimate circle they were all the more proud of him because, if, in ‘society,’ people are judged by a standard (which is incidentally absurd) and according to false but fixed rules, by comparison with the aggregate of all the other fashionable people, in the subdivisions of middle-class life, on the other hand, the dinners, the family parties all turn upon certain people who are pronounced good company, amusing, and who in ‘society’ would not survive a second evening. Moreover in such an environment where the artificial values of the aristocracy do not exist, their place is taken by distinctions even more stupid. Thus it was that in his family circle, and even among the remotest branches of the tree, an alleged similarity in his way of wearing his moustache and in the bridge of his nose led to M. Bloch’s being called “the Due d’Aumale’s double.” (In the world of club pages, the one who wears his cap on one side and his jacket tightly buttoned, so as to give himself the appearance, he imagines, of a foreign officer, is he not also a personage of a sort to his comrades?)

   The resemblance was the faintest, but you would have said that it conferred a title. When he was mentioned, it would always be: “Bloch? Which one? The Due d’Aumale?” as people say “Princesse Murât? Which one? The Queen (of Naples)?” And there were certain other minute marks which combined to give him, in the eyes of the cousinhood, an acknowledged claim to distinction. Not going the length of having a carriage of his own, M. Bloch used on special occasions to hire an open victoria with a pair of horses from the Company, and would drive through the Bois de Boulogne, his body sprawling limply from side to side, two fingers pressed to his brow, other two supporting his chin, and if people who did not know him concluded that he was an ‘old nuisance,’ they were all convinced, in the family, that for smartness Uncle Solomon could have taught Gramont-Caderousse a thing or two. He was one of those people who when they die, because for years they have shared a table in a restaurant on the boulevard with its news-editor, are described as “well known Paris figures” in the social column of the Radical. M. Bloch told Saint-Loup and me that Bergotte knew so well why he, M. Bloch, always cut him that as soon as he caught sight of him, at the theatre or in the club, he avoided his eye. Saint-Loup blushed, for it had occurred to him that this club could not be the Jockey, of which his father had been chairman. On the other hand it must be a fairly exclusive club, for M. Bloch had said that Bergotte would never have got into it if he had come up now. So it was not without the fear that he might be ‘underrating his adversary’ that Saint-Loup asked whether the club in question were the Rue Royale, which was considered ‘lowering’ by his own family, and to which he knew that certain Israelites had been admitted. “No,” replied M. Bloch in a tone at once careless, proud and ashamed, “it is a small club, but far more pleasant than a big one, the Ganaches. We’re very strict there, don’t you know.” “Isn’t Sir Rufus Israels the chairman?” Bloch junior asked his father, so as to give him the opportunity for a glorious lie, never suspecting that the financier had not the same eminence in Saint-Loup’s eyes as in his. The fact of the matter was that the Ganaches club boasted not Sir Rufus Israels but one of his staff. But as this man was on the best of terms with his employer, he had at his disposal a stock of the financier’s cards, and would give one to M. Bloch whenever he wished to travel on a line of which Sir Rufus was a director, the result of which was that old Bloch would say: “I’m just going round to the Club to ask Sir Rufus for a line to the Company.” And the card enabled him to dazzle the guards on the trains. The Misses Bloch were more interested in Bergotte and, reverting to him rather than pursue the subject of the Ganaches, the youngest asked her brother, in the most serious tone imaginable, for she believed that there existed in the world, for the designation of men of talent, no other terms than those which he was in the habit of using: “Is he really an amazing good egg, this Bergotte? Is he in the category of the great lads, good eggs like Villiers and Catullus?” “I’ve met him several times at dress rehearsals,” said M. Nissim Bernard. “He is an uncouth creature, a sort of Schlemihl.” There was nothing very serious in this allusion to Chamisso’s story but the epithet ‘Schlemihl’ formed part of that dialect, half-German, half-Jewish, the use of which delighted M. Bloch in the family circle, but struck him as vulgar and out of place before strangers. And so he cast a reproving glance at his uncle. “He has talent,” said Bloch. “Ah!” His sister sighed gravely, as though to imply that in that case there was some excuse for me. “All writers have talent,” said M. Bloch scornfully. “In fact it appears,” went on his son, raising his fork, and screwing up his eyes with an air of impish irony, “that he is going to put up for the Academy.” “Go on. He hasn’t enough to shew them,” replied his father, who seemed not to have for the Academy the same contempt as his son and daughters. “He’s not big enough.” “Besides, the Academy is a salon, and Bergotte has no polish,” declared the uncle (whose heiress Mme. Bloch was), a mild and inoffensive person whose surname, Bernard, might perhaps by itself have quickened my grandfather’s powers of diagnosis, but would have appeared too little in harmony with a face which looked as if it had been brought back from Darius’s palace and restored by Mme. Dieulafoy, had not (chosen by some collector desirous of giving a crowning touch of orientalism to this figure from Susa) his first name, Nissim, stretched out above it the pinions of an androcephalous bull from Khorsabad. But M. Bloch never stopped insulting his uncle, whether it was that he was excited by the unresisting good-humour of his butt, or that the rent of the villa being paid by M. Nissim Bernard, the beneficiary wished to shew that he kept his independence, and, more important still, that he was not seeking by flattery to make sure of the rich inheritance to come. What most hurt the old man was being treated so rudely in front of the manservant. He murmured an unintelligible sentence of which all that could be made out was: “when the meschores are in the room.” ‘Meschores,’ in the Bible, means ‘the servant of God.’ In the family circle the Blochs used the word when they referred to their own servants, and were always exhilarated by it, because their certainty of not being understood either by Christians or by the servants themselves enhanced in M. Nissim Bernard and M. Bloch their twofold distinction of being ‘masters’ and at the same time ‘Jews.’ But this latter source of satisfaction became a source of displeasure when there was ‘company.’ At such times M. Bloch, hearing his uncle say ‘meschores,’ felt that he was making his oriental side too prominent, just as a light-of-love who has invited some of her sisters to meet her respectable friends is annoyed if they allude to their profession or use words that do not sound quite nice. Therefore, so far from his uncle’s request’s producing any effect on M. Bloch, he, beside himself with rage, could contain himself no longer. He let no opportunity pass of scarifying his wretched uncle. “Of course, when there is a chance of saying anything stupid, one can be quite certain that you won’t miss it. You would be the first to lick his boots if he were in the room!” shouted M. Bloch, while M. Nissim Bernard in sorrow lowered over his plate the ringleted beard of King Sargon. My friend, when he began to grow his beard, which also was blue-black and crimped, became very like his great-uncle

    “What! Are you the son of the Marquis de Marsantes? Why, I knew him very well,” said M. Nissim Bernard to Saint-Loup. I supposed that he meant the word ‘knew’ in the sense in which Bloch’s father had said that he knew Bergotte, namely by sight. But he went on: “Your father was one of my best friends.” Meanwhile Bloch had turned very red, his father was looking intensely cross, the Misses Bloch were choking with suppressed laughter. The fact was that in M. Nissim Bernard the love of ostentation which in M. Bloch and his children was held in cheek, had engendered the habit of perpetual lying. For instance, if he was staying in an hotel, M. Nissim Bernard, as M. Bloch equally might have done, would have his newspapers brought to him always by his valet in the dining-room, in the middle of luncheon, when everybody was there, so that they should see that he travelled with a valet. But to the people with whom he made friends in the hotel the uncle used to say what the nephew would never have said, that he was a Senator. He might know quite well that they would sooner or later discover that the title was usurped; he could not, at the critical moment, resist the temptation to assume it. M. Bloch suffered acutely from his uncle’s lies and from all the embarrassments that they led to. “Don’t pay any attention to him, he talks a great deal of nonsense,” he whispered to Saint-Loup, whose interest was all the more whetted, for he was curious to explore the psychology of liars. “A greater liar even than the Ithacan Odysseus, albeit Athene called him the greatest liar among mortals,” his son completed the indictment. “Well, upon my word!” cried M. Nissim Bernard, “If I’d only known that I was going to sit down to dinner with my old friend’s son! Why, I have a photograph still of your father at home, in Paris, and any number of letters from him. He used always to call me ‘uncle,’ nobody ever knew why. He was a charming man, sparkling. I remember so well a dinner I gave at Nice; there were Sardou, Labiche, Augier,” “Molière, Racine, Corneille,” M. Bloch added with sarcasm, while his son completed the tale of guests with “Plautus, Menander, Kalidasa.” M. Nissim Bernard, cut to the quick, stopped short in his reminiscence, and, ascetically depriving himself of a great pleasure, remained silent until the end of dinner

    “Saint-Loup with helm of bronze,” said Bloch, “have a piece more of this duck with thighs heavy with fat, over which the illustrious sacrificer of birds has spilled numerous libations of red wine.”

   As a rule, after bringing out from his store for the entertainment of a distinguished guest his anecdotes of Sir Rufus Israels and others, M. Bloch, feeling that he had succeeded in touching and melting his son’s heart, would withdraw, so as not to spoil his effect in the eyes of the ‘big pot.’ If, however, there was an absolutely compelling reason, as for instance on the night when his son won his fellowship, M. Bloch would add to the usual string of anecdotes the following ironical reflexion which he ordinarily reserved for his own personal friends, so that young Bloch was extremely proud to see it produced for his: “The Government have acted unpardonably. They have forgotten to consult M. Coquelin! M. Coquelin has let it be known that he is displeased.” (M. Bloch prided himself on being a reactionary, with a contempt for theatrical people.)

   But the Misses Bloch and their brother reddened to the tips of their ears, so much impressed were they when Bloch senior, to shew that he could be regal to the last in his entertainment of his son’s two ‘chums,’ gave the order for champagne to be served, and announced casually that, as a treat for us, he had taken three stalls for the performance which a company from the Opéra-Comique was giving that evening at the Casino. He was sorry that he had not been able to get a box. They had all been taken. However, he had often been in the boxes, and really one saw and heard better down by the orchestra. All very well, only, if the defect of his son, that is to say the defect which his son believed to be invisible to other people, was coarseness, the father’s was avarice. And so it was in a decanter that we were served with, under the name of champagne, a light sparkling wine, while under that of orchestra stalls he had taken three in the pit, which cost half as much, miraculously persuaded by the divine intervention of his defect that neither at table nor in the theatre (where the boxes were all empty) would the defect be noticed. When M. Bloch had let us moisten our lips in the flat glasses which his son dignified with the style and title of ‘craters with deeply hollowed flanks,’ he made us admire a picture to which he was so much attached that he had brought it with him to Balbec. He told us that it was a Rubens. Saint-Loup asked innocently if it was signed. M. Bloch replied, blushing, that he had had the signature cut off to make it fit the frame, but that it made no difference, as he had no intention of selling the picture. Then he hurriedly bade us good-night, in order to bury himself in the Journal Officiel, back numbers of which littered the house, and which, he informed us, he was obliged to read carefully on account of his ‘parliamentary position’ as to the precise nature of which, however, he gave us no enlightenment. “I shall take a muffler,” said Bloch, “for Zephyrus and Boreas are disputing to which of them shall belong the fish-teeming sea, and should we but tarry a little after the show is over, we shall not be home before the first flush of Eos, the rosy-fingered. By the way,” he asked Saint-Loup when we were outside, and I trembled, for I realised at once that it was of M. de Charlus that Bloch was speaking in that tone of irony, “who was that excellent old card dressed in black that I saw you walking with, the day before yesterday, on the beach?” “That was my uncle.” Saint-Loup was ruffled. Unfortunately, a ‘floater’ was far from seeming to Bloch a thing to be avoided. He shook with laughter. “Heartiest congratulations; I ought to have guessed; he has an excellent style, the most priceless dial of an old ‘gaga’ of the highest lineage.” “You are absolutely mistaken; he is an extremely clever man,” retorted Saint-Loup, now furious. “I am sorry about that; it makes him less complete. All the same, I should like very much to know him, for I flatter myself I could write some highly adequate pieces about old buffers like that. Just to see him go by, he’s killing. But I should leave out of account the caricaturable side, which really is hardly worthy of an artist enamoured of the plastic beauty of phrases, of his mug, which (you’ll forgive me) doubled me up for a moment with joyous laughter, and I should bring into prominence the aristocratic side of your uncle, who after all has a distinct bovine effect, and when one has finished laughing does impress one by his great air of style. But,” he went on, addressing myself this time, “there is also a matter of a very different order about which I have been meaning to question you, and every time we are together, some god, blessed denizen of Olympus, makes me completely forget to ask for a piece of information which might before now have been and is sure some day to be of the greatest use to me. Tell me, who was the lovely lady I saw you with in the Jardin d’Acclimatation accompanied by a gentleman whom I seem to know by sight and a little girl with long hair?” It had been quite plain to me at the time that Mme. Swann did not remember Bloch’s name, since she had spoken of him by another, and had described my friend as being on the staff of some Ministry, as to which I had never since then thought of finding out whether he had joined it. But how came it that Bloch, who, according to what she then told me, had got himself introduced to her, was ignorant of her name? I was so much surprised that I stopped for a moment before answering. “Whoever she is,” he went on, “hearty congratulations; you can’t have been bored with her. I picked her up a few days before that on the Zone railway, where, speaking of zones, she was so kind as to undo hers for the benefit of your humble servant; I have never had such a time in my life, and we were just going to make arrangements to meet again when somebody she knew had the bad taste to get in at the last station but one.” My continued silence did not appear to please Bloch. “I was hoping,” he said, “thanks to you, to learn her address, so as to go there several times a week to taste in her arms the delights of Eros, dear to the gods; but I do not insist since you seem pledged to discretion with respect to a professional who gave herself to me three times running, and in the most refined manner, between Paris and the Point-du-Jour. I am bound to see her again, some night.”

   I called upon Bloch after this dinner; he returned my call, but I was out and he was seen asking for me by Françoise, who, as it happened, albeit he had visited us at Combray, had never set eyes on him until then. So that she knew only that one of ‘the gentlemen’ who were friends of mine had looked in to see me, she did not know ‘with what object,’ dressed in a nondescript way, which had not made any particular impression upon her. Now though I knew quite well that certain of Françoise’s social ideas must for ever remain impenetrable by me, ideas based, perhaps, partly upon confusions between words, between names which she had once and for all time mistaken for one another, I could not restrain myself, who had long since abandoned the quest for enlightenment in such cases, from seeking — and seeking, moreover, in vain — to discover what could be the immense significance that the name of Bloch had for Françoise. For no sooner had I mentioned to her that the young man whom she had seen was M. Bloch than she recoiled several paces, so great were her stupor and disappointment. “What! Is that M. Bloch?” she cried, thunderstruck, as if so portentous a personage ought to have been endowed with an appearance which ‘made you know’ as soon as you saw him that you were in the presence of one of the great ones of the earth; and, like some one who has discovered that an historical character is not ‘up to’ the level of his reputation, she repeated in an impressed tone, in which I could detect latent, for future growth, the seeds of a universal scepticism: “What! Is that M. Bloch? Well, really, you would never think it, to look at him.” She seemed also to bear me a grudge, as if I had always ‘overdone’ the praise of Bloch to her. At the same time she was kind enough to add: “Well, he may be M. Bloch, and all that. I’m sure Master can say he’s every bit as good.”

   She had presently, with respect to Saint-Loup, whom she worshipped, a disillusionment of a different kind and of less severity: she discovered that he was a Republican. Now for all that, when speaking, for instance, of the Queen of Portugal, she would say with that disrespect which is, among the people, the supreme form of respect: “Amélie, Philippe’s sister,” Françoise was a Royalist. But when it came to a Marquis; a Marquis who had dazzled her at first sight, and who was for the Republic, seemed no longer real. And she shewed the same ill-humour as if I had given her a box which she had believed to be made of gold, and had thanked me for it effusively, and then a jeweller had revealed to her that it was only plated. She at once withdrew her esteem from Saint-Loup, but soon afterwards restored it to him, having reflected that he could not, being the Marquis de Saint-Loup, be a Republican, that he was just pretending, in his own interest, for with such a Government as we had it might be a great advantage to him. From that moment her coldness towards him, her resentment towards myself ceased. And when she spoke of Saint-Loup she said: “He is a hypocrite,” with a broad and friendly smile which made it clear that she ‘considered’ him again just as much as when she first knew him, and that she had forgiven him

   As a matter of fact, Saint-Loup was absolutely sincere and disinterested, and it was this intense moral purity which, not being able to find entire satisfaction in a selfish sentiment such as love, nor on the other hand meeting in him the impossibility (which existed in me, for instance) of finding its spiritual nourishment elsewhere than in himself, rendered him truly capable (just as I was incapable) of friendship

   Françoise was no less mistaken about Saint-Loup when she complained that he had that sort of air, as if he did not look down upon the people, but that it was all just a pretence, and you had only to see him when he was in a temper with his groom. It had indeed sometimes happened that Robert would scold his groom with a certain amount of brutality, which proved that he had the sense not so much of the difference as of the equality between classes and masses. “But,” he said in answer to my rebuke of his having treated the man rather harshly, “why should I go out of my way to speak politely to him? Isn’t he my equal? Isn’t he just as near to me as any of my uncles and cousins? You seem to think that I ought to treat him with respect, as an inferior. You talk like an aristocrat!” he added scornfully

   And indeed if there was a class to which he shewed himself prejudiced and hostile, it was the aristocracy, so much so that he found it as hard to believe in the superior qualities of a man in society as he found it easy to believe in those of a man of the people. When I mentioned the Princesse de Luxembourg, whom I had met with his aunt:

    “An old trout,” was his comment. “Like all that lot. She’s a sort of cousin of mine, by the way.”

   Having a strong prejudice against the people who frequented it, he went rarely into ‘Society,’ and the contemptuous or hostile attitude which he adopted towards it served to increase, among all his near relatives, the painful impression made by his intimacy with a woman on the stage, a connexion which, they declared, would be his ruin, blaming it specially for having bred in him that spirit of denigration, that bad spirit, and for having led him astray, after which it was only a matter of time before he would have dropped out altogether. And so, many easy-going men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain were without compunction when they spoke of Robert’s mistress. “Those girls do their job,” they would say, “they are as good as anybody else. But that one; no, thank youl We cannot forgive her. She has done too much harm to a fellow we were fond of.” Of course, he was not the first to be caught in that snare. But the others amused themselves like men of the world, continued to think like men of the world about politics, about everything. As for him, his family found him ‘soured.’ They did not bear in mind that, for many young men of fashion who would otherwise remain uncultivated mentally, rough in their friendships, without gentleness or taste — it is very often their mistress who is their real master, and connexions of this sort the only school of morals in which they are initiated into a superior culture, and learn the value of disinterested relations. Even among the lower orders (who, when it comes to coarseness, so often remind us of the world of fashion) the woman, more sensitive, finer, more leisured, is driven by curiosity to adopt certain refinements, respects certain beauties of sentiment and of art which, though she may fail to understand them, she nevertheless places above what has seemed most desirable to the man, above money or position. Now whether the mistress be a young blood’s (such as Saint-Loup) or a young workman’s (electricians, for instance, must now be included in our truest order of Chivalry) her lover has too much admiration and respect for her not to extend them also to what she herself respects and admires; and for him the scale of values is thereby reversed. Her sex alone makes her weak; she suffers from nervous troubles, inexplicable things which in a man, or even in another woman — a woman whose nephew or cousin he was — would bring a smile to the lips of this stalwart young man. But he cannot bear to see her suffer whom he loves. The young nobleman who, like Saint-Loup, has a mistress acquires the habit, when he takes her out to dine, of carrying in his pocket the valerian ‘drops’ which she may need, of ordering the waiter, firmly and with no hint of sarcasm, to see that he shuts the doors quietly and not to put any damp moss on the table, so as to spare his companion those discomforts which himself he has never felt, which compose for him an occult world in whose reality she has taught him to believe, discomforts for which he now feels pity without in the least needing to understand them, for which he will still feel pity when other women than she shall be the sufferers. Saint-Loup’s mistress — as the first monks of the middle ages taught Christendom — had taught him to be kind to animals, for which she had a passion, never moving without her dog, her canaries, her love-birds; Saint-Loup looked after them with motherly devotion and treated as brutes the people who were not good to dumb creatures. On the other hand, an actress, or so-called actress, like this one who was living with him — whether she were intelligent or not, and as to that I had no knowledge — by making him find the society of fashionable women boring, and look upon having to go out to a party as a painful duty, had saved him from snobbishness and cured him of frivolity. If, thanks to her, his social engagements filled a smaller place in the life of her young lover, at the same time, whereas if he had been simply a drawing-room man, vanity or self-interest would have dictated his choice of friends as rudeness would have characterised his treatment of them, his mistress had taught him to bring nobility and refinement into his friendship. With her feminine instinct, with a keener appreciation in men of certain qualities of sensibility which her lover might perhaps, without her guidance, have misunderstood and laughed at, she had always been swift to distinguish from among the rest of Saint-Loup’s friends, the one who had a real affection for him, and to make that one her favourite. She knew how to make him feel grateful to such a friend, shew his gratitude, notice what things gave his friend pleasure and what pain. And presently Saint-Loup, without any more need of her to prompt him, began to think of all these things by himself, and at Balbec, where she was not with him, for me whom she had never seen, whom he had perhaps not yet so much as mentioned in his letters to her, of his own accord would pull up the window of a carriage in which I was sitting, take out of the room the flowers that made me feel unwell, and when he had to say good-bye to several people at once manage to do so before it was actually time for him to go, so as to be left alone and last with me, to make that distinction between them and me, to treat me differently from the rest. His mistress had opened his mind to the invisible, had brought a serious element into his life, delicacy into his heart, but all this escaped his sorrowing family who repeated: “That creature will be the death of him; meanwhile she’s doing what she can to disgrace him.” It is true that he had succeeded in getting out of her all the good that she was capable of doing him; and that she now caused him only incessant suffering, for she had taken an intense dislike to him and tormented him in every possible way. She had begun, one fine day, to look upon him as stupid and absurd because the friends that she had among the younger writers and actors had assured her that he was, and she duly repeated what they had said with that passion, that want of reserve which we shew whenever we receive from without and adopt as our own opinions or customs of which we previously knew nothing. She readily professed, like her actor friends, that between Saint-Loup and herself there was a great gulf fixed, and not to be crossed, because they were of different races, because she was an intellectual and he, whatever he might pretend, the born enemy of the intellect. This view of him seemed to her profound, and she sought confirmation of it in the most insignificant words, the most trivial actions of her lover. But when the same friends had further convinced her that she was destroying, in company so ill-suited to her, the great hopes which she had, they said, aroused in them, that her lover would leave a mark on her, that by living with him she was spoiling her future as an artist; to her contempt for Saint-Loup was added the same hatred that she would have felt for him if he had insisted upon inoculating her with a deadly germ. She saw him as seldom as possible, at the same time postponing the hour of a definite rupture, which seemed to me a highly improbable event. Saint-Loup made such sacrifices for her that unless she was ravishingly beautiful (but he had always refused to shew me her photograph, saying: “For one thing, she’s not a beauty, and besides she always takes badly. These are only some snapshots that I took myself with my kodak; they would give you a wrong idea of her.”) it would surely be difficult for her to find another man who would consent to anything of the sort. I never reflected that a certain obsession to make a name for oneself, even when one has no talent, that the admiration, no more than the privately expressed admiration of people who are imposing on one, can (although it may not perhaps have been the case with Saint-Loup’s mistress) be, even for a little prostitute, motives more determining than the pleasure of making money. Saint-Loup who, without quite understanding what was going on in the mind of his mistress, did not believe her to be completely sincere either in her unfair reproaches or in her promises of undying love, had all the same at certain moments the feeling that she would break with him whenever she could, and accordingly, impelled no doubt by the instinct of self-preservation which was part of his love, a love more clear-sighted, possibly, than Saint-Loup himself, making use, too, of a practical capacity for business which was compatible in him with the loftiest and blindest flights of the heart, had refused to settle upon her any capital, had borrowed an enormous sum so that she should want nothing, but made it over to her only from day to day. And no doubt, assuming that she really thought of leaving him, she was calmly waiting until she had feathered her nest, a process which, with the money given her by Saint-Loup, would not perhaps take very long, but would all the same require a time which must be conceded to prolong the happiness of my new friend — or his misery

   This dramatic period of their connexion, which had now reached its most acute stage, the most cruel for Saint-Loup, for she had forbidden him to remain in Paris, where his presence exasperated her, and had forced him to spend his leave at Balbec, within easy reach of his regiment — had begun one evening at the house of one of Saint-Loup’s aunts, on whom he had prevailed to allow his friend to come there, before a large party, to recite some of the speeches from a symbolical play in which she had once appeared in an ‘advanced’ theatre, and for which she had made him share the admiration that she herself professed

   But when she appeared in the room, with a large lily in her hand, and wearing a costume copied from the Ancilla Domini, which she had persuaded Saint-Loup was an absolute ‘vision of beauty,’ her entrance had been greeted, in that assemblage of clubmen and duchesses, with smiles which the monotonous tone of her chantings, the oddity of certain words and their frequent recurrence had changed into fits of laughter, stifled at first but presently so uncontrollable that the wretched reciter had been unable to go on. Next day Saint-Loup’s aunt had been universally censured for having allowed so grotesque an actress to appear in her drawing-room. A well-known duke made no bones about telling her that she had only herself to blame if she found herself criticised. “Damn it all, people really don’t come to see ‘turns’ like that! If the woman had talent, even; but she has none and never will have any. ‘Pon my soul, Paris is not such a fool as people make out. Society does not consist exclusively of imbeciles. This little lady evidently believed that she was going to take Paris by surprise. But Paris is not so easily surprised as all that, and there are still some things that they can’t make us swallow.”

   As for the actress, she left the house with Saint-Loup, exclaiming: “What do you mean by letting me in for those geese, those uneducated bitches, those dirty corner-boys? I don’t mind telling you, there wasn’t a man in the room who didn’t make eyes at me or squeeze my foot, and it was because I wouldn’t look at them that they were out for revenge.”

   Words which had changed Robert’s antipathy for people in society into a horror that was at once deep and distressing, and was provoked in him most of all by those who least deserved it, devoted kinsmen who, on behalf of the family, had sought to persuade Saint-Loup’s lady to break with him, a move which she represented to him as inspired by their passion for her. Robert, although he had at once ceased to see them, used to imagine when he was parted from his mistress as he was now, that they or others like them were profiting by his absence to return to the charge and had possibly prevailed over her. And when he spoke of the sensualists who were disloyal to their friends, who sought to seduce their friends’ wives, tried to make them come to houses of assignation, his whole face would glow with suffering and hatred

    “I would kill them with less compunction than I would kill a dog, which is at least a well-behaved beast, and loyal and faithful. There are men who deserve the guillotine if you like, far more than poor wretches who have been led into crime by poverty and by the cruelty of the rich.”

   He spent the greater part of his time in sending letters and telegrams to his mistress. Every time that, while still preventing him from returning to Paris, she found an excuse to quarrel with him by post, I read the news at once in his evident discomposure. Inasmuch as his mistress never told him what fault she found with him, suspecting that possibly if she did not tell him it was because she did not know herself, and simply had had enough of him, he would still have liked an explanation and used to write to her: “Tell me what I have done wrong. I am quite ready to acknowledge my faults,” the grief that overpowered him having the effect of persuading him that he had behaved badly

   But she kept him waiting indefinitely for her answers which, when they did come, were meaningless. And so it was almost always with a furrowed brow, and often with empty hands that I would see Saint-Loup returning from the post office, where, alone in all the hotel, he and Françoise went to fetch or to hand in letters, he from a lover’s impatience, she with a servant’s mistrust of others. (His telegrams obliged him to take a much longer journey.)

   When, some days after our dinner with the Blochs, my grandmother told me with a joyful air that Saint-Loup had just been asking her whether, before he left Balbec, she would not like him to take a photograph of her, and when I saw that she had put on her nicest dress on purpose, and was hesitating between several of her best hats, I felt a little annoyed by this childishness, which surprised me coming from her. I even went the length of asking myself whether I had not been mistaken in my grandmother, whether I did not esteem her too highly, whether she was as unconcerned as I had always supposed in the adornment of her person, whether she had not indeed the very weakness that I believed most alien to her temperament, namely coquetry

   Unfortunately, this displeasure that I derived from the prospect of a photographic ‘sitting,’ and more particularly from the satisfaction with which my grandmother appeared to be looking forward to it, I made so apparent that Françoise remarked it and did her best, unintentionally, to increase it by making me a sentimental, gushing speech, by which I refused to appear moved

    “Oh, Master; my poor Madame will be so pleased at having her likeness taken, she is going to wear the hat that her old Françoise has trimmed for her, you must allow her, Master.”

   I acquired the conviction that I was not cruel in laughing at Françoise’s sensibility, by reminding myself that my mother and grandmother, my models in all things, often did the same. But my grandmother, noticing that I seemed cross, said that if this plan of her sitting for her photograph offended me in any way she would give it up. I would not let her; I assured her that I saw no harm in it, and left her to adorn herself, but, thinking that I shewed my penetration and strength of mind, I added a few stinging words of sarcasm, intended to neutralize the pleasure which she seemed to find in being photographed, so that if I was obliged to see my grandmother’s magnificent hat, I succeeded at least in driving from her face that joyful expression which ought to have made me glad; but alas, it too often happens, while the people we love best are still alive, that such expressions appear to us as the exasperating manifestation of some unworthy freak of fancy rather than as the precious form of the happiness which we should dearly like to procure for them. My ill-humour arose more particularly from the fact that, during the last week, my grandmother had appeared to be avoiding me, and I had not been able to have her to myself for a moment, either by night or day. When I came back in the afternoon to be alone with her for a little I was told that she was not in the hotel; or else she would shut herself up with Françoise for endless confabulations which I was not permitted to interrupt. And when, after being out all evening with Saint-Loup, I had been thinking on the way home of the moment at which I should be able to go to my grandmother and to kiss her, in vain might I wait for her to knock on the partition between us the three little taps which would tell me to go in and say good night to her; I heard nothing; at length I would go to bed, a little resentful of her for depriving me, with an indifference so new and strange in her, of a joy on which I had so much counted, I would lie still for a while, my heart throbbing as in my childhood, listening to the wall which remained silent, until I cried myself to sleep",Marcel Proust,1975,"[64, 39, 45, 50, 66, 17, 7, 3, 4]",9

553,Future Shock,"I was born in '82
'bout the time of the Cold War flu
Born when the world was small
Before we connected the zoo
But look at the way we grew
Dropped the borders, but we kept them walls
The things we made to pull us close push us all
We hear the ring, but we screen the calls

So close we can almost touch
So far we don't speak on the bus
So close I can almost see your breath
So far I can't hear your words
I don't go a day without a button press
The years go by in a blur
The time a-plenty, inbox full
So why do I feel so god damn empty?
But look at how connected we are now
The whole globe at your fingertips
Speed the pace, it's an instant fix
Space age, but I feel boxed in
And it's wide open, and I'm dying to know
Why I feel disconnected
Am I dreaming demons, alienated
Or do I just get what I expected?
They say it's greed that keeps people turnin'
Feeds the lonely and the beasts of burden
East of Eden, but at least we're earnin'
The ice is meltin'
And the trees are burnin'
Reporters say that it's all but lost now
And all we can do is watch
So I walk with my shoulders dropped
Watch these blocks stack up with stores
Is this what we're working for?
Filling that home with goods, what's good
But the chokehold ain't local no more
It's global and closin' its doors
And it ain't about right or wrong, what side you're on
But the things we traded
How many sights for how many sites
How is your life, how is your life?

And I don't mean ""Do you like your life?""
I mean ""What is your life like?""
I ain't tryin' to be deep, believe me
I'm just tryin' to keep my head above water

I was born in '82
But I live in two-thousand and now
All the things I thought I knew
Turns out they were never around
And all the people I met today
Well, they all the same
Fillin' that emptiness
Fill it up with Fendi till the trendiness fades
Then throw that thing away

I want the one with the new features
Till the next one, out there
Bury it a little deeper
Add on to the man made mountain
You can have it all, the campaign toutin'
The cars and the champagne fountain
But that pool's only deep enough to sink
But these fools don't even stop to think

Now they spillin' on you, ain't that lovely?
What a mess since they jumped in

They never met, they never kissed
They will never know what happiness they've missed
'Cause he lived on the morningside of the mountain
And she lived on the twilight side of the hill
Both:
For love's a rose that never grows
Without the kiss of the morning dew
And every Jack must have a Jill
To know the thrill of a dream that comes true
[Donny:]
And you and I are just like they
For all we know our love is just a kiss away

Cause it's you that's got to change

561,Your Bulldog Drinks Champagne,"There was a lady in a window

In the room across the way

From the hotel I was staying in

While on my holiday

I couldn't help but see everything

'Cause I was peeping I confess

Still after dinner every night

She had the strangest guest

She'd retire to her favorite chair

And sit there with a dog

Fill the crystal glasses

While the fire danced on the log

I watched them drink their bubbly brew

Until the fire grew dim

Then I stuck my head out the window

And said why not me instead of him

Oh your bulldog drinks champagne

And I ain't one to complain

What a perfect waste of wine it seems to be

So honey, tell ol' rover that the big dog's coming over

'Cause any woman that would get a bulldog drunk

Would have to be good to me

Fourteen days and fourteen nights

Not one word did I hear

Her with her silk and champagne

Over to me in my shorts with a beer

She just left the curtains wide

And I knew she knew I could see

Her and the pug-nosed mutt

Guzzling wine and teasing me

Oh your bulldog drinks champagne

And I ain't one to complain

What a perfect waste of wine it seems to be

So honey, tell ol' rover that the big dog's coming over

'Cause any woman that would get a bulldog drunk

Would have to be good to me

So I made a bolder move

I went over and rang her bell

I heard growling from inside

And I got scared as hell

Then the bulldog staggered out the door

And he said, how do yo do

But the lady bit me on the leg

And I said r-rouf, I love you too

Oh your bulldog drinks champagne

And I ain't one to complain

What a perfect waste of wine it seems to be

So honey, tell ol' rover that the big dog's coming over

'Cause any woman that would get a bulldog drunk

Would have to be good to me",Jim Stafford,1975,"[73, 36, 24, 25, 30, 38, 46, 58]",8

Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down and pronouced dead at 1:15 this morning
As a result of the ongoing feud between East and West coast
The tragic death of 2Pac Shakur who was gunned down in Las Vegas
Just six months earlier, our prayers go out to the families

Brought you Michel'le, brought you D.O.C., and the list goes on
We definitely gon' miss you Eazy

Picture me rollin in that black B-M-dub, headed to the club
Fresh out the Tyson fight, Beamer all rimmed up
Shinin' with the big homie, five-car caravan
Ridin' shotgun, put that chronic smoke in the air
Me Against the World is what I told my foes
So it's me against the world, 'til they poke them hoes
Leanin' out the window, flickin' ashes off the indo
Throwin' up Westside, I see, some of my kinfolk
Pull that blunt closer to my mouth 'cause only she know
I'm feelin' bad about that nigga we stomped out in that casino
But fuck it it's Death Row, the big homie never told me
That my next blow could be my fuckin' death blow
Tell Kidada I'm not ready, I ain't even let my momma know
I ain't got no kids, I'm only twenty-fo'
Before I can let the smoke out, niggas let twenty go
The thirteen that hit the car was through the passenger do'

Gotta call my nigga Sean, tell him reserve the Dom
Tell him to get the chron' and the teflon
I think they trippin' off the homie gettin' shot
But God bless his soul, Lord know it wasn't Pop
Or the M.A.F.I.A., Kim tell Cease get the fuckin' truck
We 'bout to hit the Wilshire district, get fucked up
Pop mad bottles son, twist up the Phillies
I'm thinkin' 'bout T'yanna, these niggas is lookin' silly
If this was Blooklyn I would up the 9-milli
But fuck it we to the truck, roll the dutch, we out of Phillies
Hop in the front seat, of that dark green Suburban
Heard another car swervin', gunshots close the curtains

But I couldn't hear Cube and Dr. Dre no more at all

And I sat by my record player, playin' every note they played
And I watched them all on TV, makin every move they made

Rock and roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
All the dreamy sunny Sundays, all the moon-lit summer nights
I was so busy in the back room writin' love songs to you
While you were changin' your direction, and you never even knew
That I was always, just one step behind you

'66 seemed like the year I was really goin' somewhere
We were living in San Francisco, with flowers in our hair
Singing songs of kindness so the world would understand
But the guys and me were something more than just another band
And then '69 in LA, came around so soon
We were really making headway and writing lots of tunes
And we must have played the wildest stuff we had ever played
The way the crowds cried out for us, we thought we had it made

Rock and roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
All the crazy lazy young days, all the magic moon-lit nights
I was so busy on the road singin' love songs to you
While you were changin' your direction, and you never even knew
That I was alwyas, just one step behind you

'71 in Soho, when I saw Suzanne
I was trying to go it solo, with someone else's band
And she came up to me later and I took her by the hand
And I told her all my troubles and she seemed to understand
And she followed me through London, through a hundred hotel rooms
Throught a hundred record companies who didn't like my tunes
And she followed me when, finally, I sold my old guitar
And she tried to help me understand, I'd never be a star

Chorus:
Rock and roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
All the dreamy sunny Sundays, all the moon-lit summer nights
And though I never knew the magic of makin' it with you
Thank the Lord for giving me the little bit I knew
And I will always be one step behind you

Rock and roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
Singing out my love songs in the brightly flashing lights
And though I never knew the magic of makin' it with you
Thank the Lord for giving me the little bit I knew

Rock and roll, I gave you all the best years of my life
All the dreamy sunny Sundays, all the moon-lit summer nights
I was so busy in the back room makin' love songs to you
While you were changin' your direction, and you never even knew
That I was always, just one step behind you",Mac Davis,1975,"[46, 22, 15, 16, 16, 20, 25]",7

Roll out the red carpet baby the god has come
No matter who you are or where you from
Check it I stay be repin the street and reppin the slum
And while you co-starrin' this movie I star is the one, listen
You never imagined that I would become one of the most incredible
Until when ever I'm done
Notice the god like meet you from when I was young
Blessed with such immaculate flow and a venomous tongue
How we keep you holla until you collapse on the lung
With the biggest followin' the nigga slackin a nun
Able to move a mountain of niggas havin then sprung
Just check out my women but how be havin then strung ass though
Like how the coke be havin them numb
Run up in the spot like I was holdin and clappin' the gun
Now I'm lose for y'all I'm bringin the proof to y'all
Ballin and speckin the truth to y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
The chorus is singin' the words that I fill in my gut
That's why I always step with a bop and walk with a strut
And I always rep for the block and we all for the bucks
And we always step in the spot and be all for the cut
Vallet block two parkin' spots all for the turck
Bounce to the world when I be tired and be gone for the month
And it's all for the slut flowin' like a force of the water
Keepin' it runin so were the niggas be at
Well they seein me commin'
Summers people keep it clapin' women just give me they lovin'
They way the streets be fillin' the kid they really be buggin'
Like I'm there dearly beloved my soldiers really be thuggin
Or how I really be slugging' the ball out the ball park
Keep them whilin' then ten minutes later then it's sawed off
Create a small spark then down to the levels to make the walls stark
Testin' the God I think he be needin' them all off

Niggas think they rockin' the crowd but ain't rockin' it right
Make the people shout to the sound and rock for the night
Cause I stay in the struggle ready rock for the fight
I stay whipin' the truck and leanin' and rock what I like
And quadruple my money more than the block of the white

571,Bungle In The Jungle,"{Intro}

Walking through forests of palm tree apartments
Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents
Down by the waterhole, drunk every Friday
Eating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday
Lions and tigers who wait in the shadows
They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows

Well, that's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yeah
Well, I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree

Just say a word and the boys will be right there
With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?
Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder
I'll write on your tombstone, and thank you for dinner
This game that we animals play is a winner

Well, that's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
I'm a snake if we disagree, yes

{Bridge}

The rivers are full of crocodile nasties
And he who made kittens put snakes in their grasp
He's a lover of life but a player of pawns
Yes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn
To light up His Jungle as play is resumed
The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune

Well, that's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
And I'm a snake when we disagree, yes

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
Well, I'm a tiger when I want love

572,Changes,"[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Interlude: 2Pac]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
(You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

581,Kung Fu Fighting,"Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There were funky Chinamen from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up and they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip, and kicking from the hip

Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening, hell, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said: ""Here comes the big boss, lets get it on""
We took a bow and made a stand, started swinging with the hand
The sudden motion made me skip now we're into a brand new trip

Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening

582,Angie Baby,"{Intro}

You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock'n'roll radio
And when a young girl
Doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go

Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you outta school
You're a little touched you know
Angie Baby

{Hook}

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door

Angie girl, are you allright
Tell the radio good night
All alone once more
Angie Baby

Angie Baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night through her window blind

""I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today
I'll show you how to have a good time
Angie Baby""

Angie baby
Angie baby

When he walks in her room
He feels confused like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud
It spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way

And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

{Hook}

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover who keeps her satisfied

It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side
Angie Baby

Angie Baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe

584,Cat's In The Cradle,"[Verse 1]
My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you""

When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw"", I said ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him""

Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad

You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 3]
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while""
He shook his head and then said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please""

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

It's always later, ""uh huh"", ""okay, whatever""
As if this time apart between us will make it better
I'm waiting for your call in the late hours of the night
Hopin' you come around, give in and make it right
And when I say a thing you can't help but explode
Why is it when we talk you switch to defensive mode?
We talk about change but the moments yet to come
'Cause when we hit the bottom, we're quick to leave and run
All I want is Love, baby, help us make us grow
We connect on levels that nobody else knows
You lift me to my highest and you bring me to my lows
But that's just hard proof that we grew to be so close
I'm working every day trynna figure how to please you
I even wrote this song hopin' maybe it'll reach you
But for now, I sit here and wait for your call
Grabbin' on my chest and leanin' against the wall

There's a hole in my Heart (8x)

[Verse 2:]
And this song ain't a song to attack you
It isn't all your fault, girl I know that I'm a handful
I could be sensitive, I could have my days
But what's a relationship without a little pain?
At times I drive you crazy, there's times when I'm slow
We tear eachother down, rebuild and then we grow
On a rollercoaster of emotions, going through the motions
Crash and then burn, then we laugh and then learn
We ain't perfect, and I could feel it in my heart
That you're worth it, and I felt it from the start
From the first kiss, so every second you don't call
I feel it hurtin', I know for certain that I'm
Deeply into you
If you're gone one moment, I'm missing you
You're the walking definition of Beautiful
And when I'm with you I'm invincible

I've taken more than moon beams home in a jar

Break of day and I'm feelin' hazy
And she's feelin' good
Milky Way is all in my mind
I have no sense of direction when
Loving you
I lose conception of time
Under the midnight sky baby get next to me
Can you feel it

After the day is done
An invitation to find temptation
Under the midnight sun

Under a midnight sky, baby...get next to me",The Isley Brothers,1975,"[74, 73, 77, 80, 83]",5

596,Let Me Start Tonite,"Do you remember the day
When you walked away
I never had a chance
To tell my story

I'd been out all night
Had too much to drink
And couldn't think

I just lost my job
And thought that I'd been robbed
And feeling lonely was to blame
For the lipstick stains

Just let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby
Lyrics courtesy Top40db
Ooh, wee

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knee
To get you back, baby
Yes, I will

You got me doing time
Going out of my mind
???

Honey, you got the key
Won't you set me free
Girl, have pity on me

I'll make the change
I'll rearrange everything
Cause there's no light without you

I got my head together
I promise never to
Hurt you again, baby

Let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby
Ooh, girl, ooh, honey

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knees
To get you back home, darling
Yes, I will

There's somebody out there lonely tonight
And for one reason or another
You're having trouble with your lover
Well, here's a lesson for free
Already been tested by me

If there's somebody you want bad enough
You won't mind pushing aside your pride
Cause whatever's needed to get over
You shoot your best shot
Give it all you got

It all depends on how much
You want it and how bad
Cause it definitely can be had
That's why I don't mind begging
Oh, yeah, for my lady

Now I want you all to sing along with me
Maybe my baby will feel sorry for me
And come on back home, right here

(Let me start tonight, let me start tonight)
Oh, oh, yeah
(Let me start tonight, let me start tonight)
Think I need to call my lady and tell her

To let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby
Oh, yeah

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knees
To get you back home, darling

You just let me start tonight.....",Lamont Dozier,1975,"[94, 87, 91, 91, 96]",5

Dirty old hole in the side of the road for the man who cleans the streets
Open pub doors where the working class goes at night
Written on walls where the cats never crawl for the glass along the top
Man, I was born there, I'm gonna walk right back

CHORUS:
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I feel so lonely, I've been too long away
Costafine Town, it's a fine town, I'm coming home
I wish I'd never made up my mind to stray

Nobody owns all the dirty old clothes that are lying in the lane
Whistling loud, the four-thirty shift has gone
Little old man with a pole in his hand lighting lamps along the way
Hurry me back there, I wish I'd never gone

602,When A Child Is Born,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny spark lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

It's all a dream, an illusion now
It must come true, sometime soon, somehow

614,Must Of Got Lost,"[Verse 1]
Never thought about tomorrow
Seemed like a long time to come
How could I be so blind, baby
Not to see you were the one

I let ya slip on from me, honey
I let you walk on by
I refused the love you had for me
I refused to love and let it die

[Chorus]
I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Give away the days you were mine

[Verse 2]
Don't know why I let you leave me
Honey, I don’t know
They say it's hard to see love comin'
But babe, you always see it go

[Chorus]
I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
To give away the days you were mine

Love can be a sweet thing
I just don’t understand
I made a game outta lovin' you
And now I hold the losin' hand

[Chorus]
So, I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Give away the days you were mine

I just can't understand it
I just can't understand it
I just don't understand it

I must of got lost, I must of got lost
To give away them days you were mine

[Outro]
I must of got lost, I must of got lost, I must of got lost
Somewhere down the line
I must of got lost, I must of got lost

615,Promised Land,"[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh
And on across Caroline
We stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
We never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling outta the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Riding across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh, when the pilot told me us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten o nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line",Chuck Berry,1975,"[64, 49, 38]",3

I know you remember them times
When I hit it right soon as we got fuckin' home
And although that shit wasn't right
Talking to hoes and doing you fuckin' wrong
Now I'm on my fuckin' own
Shit, I'm o my fuckin' own
Huh, I'm on my fuckin' own you know
It's the God, nah forreal, time to wake the city up
Look, she keep on calling me psycho
Her mama was there, I couldn't hit through the front
So I had to sneak through the side door
I really hate that I broke yo' lil heart
Didn't really think you would cry, though
We break up, then make up, then break up again
Shit, it was a good try, though
But, shit, its goodbye, hoe
It ain't no mufuckin' secret
Breakin' my heart up in pieces
I know the game, I should teach it
'Cause these niggas hate for no mufuckin' reason
Yeah, believe it
Whenever you go, I hate to see you leavin'
Got me regretting and grieving
I like to take my time and beat up the pussy
Don't give a fuck if my phone keep on ringin'

American Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace ""HIS GIRL FRIDAY"" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but –

YOUNG WOMAN
– but you forget about it in a day
or two -

YOUNG MAN
– yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I'm doin' fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier!  Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: ""We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er.""

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl – the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
""Empty out the register,"" and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
""Garcon"" means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I'm ready, let's go, right here,
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS
down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front
seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both
wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long
green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES
WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
– Okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause – get a load of
this – if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it.

VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know
what the funniest thing about Europe
is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there,
they wouldn't know what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What'd they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
Le Big Mac. What do they call a
Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
King.  But you know what they put on
french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
little bit on the side of the plate,
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
Uuccch!

inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I'm not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up there?

JULES
It's possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What's her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What's a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don't watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait
for the elevator.

JULES
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him
Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT
Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call the
brother fat. He's got a weight
problem.  What's the nigger gonna
do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT
I think I know who you mean, what
about him?

JULES
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
good.  And word around the campfire,
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

VINCENT
What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES
No no no no no no no, nothin' that
bad.

VINCENT
Well what then?

JULES
He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT
A foot massage?

Jules nods his head: ""Yes.""

VINCENT
That's all?

Jules nods his head: ""Yes.""

VINCENT
What did Marsellus do?

JULES
Sent a couple of guys over to his
place.  They took him out on the
patio of his apartment, threw his
ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell
four stories. They had this garden
at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
like one of them greenhouses – nigger
fell through that. Since then, he's
kinda developed a speech impediment.

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

VINCENT
That's a damn shame.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
down the hall.

VINCENT
Still I hafta say, play with matches,
ya get burned.

JULES
Whaddya mean?

VINCENT
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES
You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT
Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react like he did, but
he had to expect a reaction.

JULES
It was a foot massage, a foot massage
is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage.

VINCENT
It's laying hands on Marsellus
Wallace's new wife in a familiar
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
– no, but you're in the same fuckin'
ballpark.

Jules stops Vincent.

JULES
Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES
It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES
Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages – I'm the foot fuckin'
master.

VINCENT
Given a lot of 'em?

JULES
Shit yeah. I got my technique down
man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?

Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

JULES
Fuck you.

He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a
little bit behind.

VINCENT
How many?

JULES
Fuck you.

VINCENT
Would you give me a foot massage –
I'm kinda tired.

JULES
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
pissed – this is the door.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered ""49."" They
whisper.

JULES
What time is it?

VINCENT
(checking his watch)
Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
still whispering.

JULES
Look, just because I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage, don't make it
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
way the nigger talks. That ain't
right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT
I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
but you know it and she knows it,
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
have a sense of humor about that
shit.

JULES
That's an interesting point, but
let's get into character.

VINCENT
What's her name again?

JULES
Mia. Why you so interested in big
man's wife?

VINCENT
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
and when he's gone, he wants me to
take care of Mia.

JULES
Take care of her?

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

VINCENT
Not that! Take her out. Show her a
good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
out on a date?

VINCENT
It ain't a date. It's like when you
and your buddy's wife go to a movie
or somethin'. It's just... you know...
good company.

Jules just looks at him.

VINCENT
It's not a date.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

JULES
Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a ""Flock of
Seagulls"" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: ""No.""

JULES
We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

JULES
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?

VINCENT
No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

JULES
You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT
I ain't hungry.

JULES
Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast
food drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: ""Yes.""

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN
It's under the be –

JULES
– I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

ROGER
It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
a black snap briefcase.

VINCENT
Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
just stares at it, transfixed.

JULES
We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

JULES
Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

JULES
We happy?

Closing the case.

VINCENT
We're happy.

BRETT
(to Jules)
Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit.

BRETT
I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions –

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

JULES
(to Brett)
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that.  Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about ""best
intentions.""

Brett can't say a word.

JULES
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
front of an interrogator.

JULES
What country you from!

BRETT
(petrified)
What?

JULES
""What"" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in ""What?""

BRETT
(near heart attack)
What?

JULES
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

BRETT
(out of fear)
What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
cheek.

JULES
Say ""What"" again! C'mon, say ""What""
again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say ""What"" one more
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

JULES
Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

BRETT
Well he's... he's... black –

JULES
– go on!

BRETT
...and he's... he's... bald –

JULES
– does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT
(without thinking)
What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in
the chair.

JULES
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT
(in agony)
No.

JULES
Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!

BRETT
(in spasm)
I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

JULES
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT
(in spasm)
Yes.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you.""

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
Brett.

AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

""VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE""

FADE IN:

MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old
prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue
high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is
everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds
like a cross between a gangster and a king.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I think you're gonna find – when all
this shit is over and done – I think
you're gonna find yourself one smilin'
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right
now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don't last. Now
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of
life, but it's a fact of life your
ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass
aged like wine.  Besides, even if
you went all the way, what would you
be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you
can even get a credit card based on
that.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front
of Butch. Butch picks it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Now the night of the fight, you may
fell a slight sting, that's pride
fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride
only hurts, it never helps. Fight
through that shit. 'Cause a year
from now, when you're kickin' it in
the Caribbean you're gonna say,
""Marsellus Wallace was right.""

BUTCH
I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Butch nods his head: ""yes.""

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Say it!

BUTCH
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964
cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio,
ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus
owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
LeRoy's.

ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door
in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave
crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT
Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE
He's over there, finishing up some
business.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with
his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of
yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go
on over.  In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?

VINCENT
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'
American?

ENGLISH DAVE
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia
out tomorrow?

VINCENT
At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE
Have you met Mia?

VINCENT
Not yet.

English Dave smiles to himself.

VINCENT
What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE
Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit
across a table, chew my food with my
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and
that's all I'm gonna do.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

ENGLISH DAVE
My name's Paul, and this is between
y'all.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his
cup of ""Plain ol' American.""

BUTCH
(to English Dave)
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE
Filters?

BUTCH
Non.

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his
coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

BUTCH
Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT
I ain't your friend, palooka.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

BUTCH
What was that?

VINCENT
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure
that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend
of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays
English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

CLOSEUP – JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of
her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in
her lips, eyebrows and nose.

JODY
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
book on body piercing.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is
at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

TRUDI
You know how they use that gun when
they pierce your ears? They don't
use that when they pierce your
nipples, do they?

JODY
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing. All
of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of 'em done with a
needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One
through my right nostril.  One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
my tongue.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
and out the other, until that last remark.

VINCENT
(interrupting)
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
curious, why would you get a stud in
your tongue?

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
thing in the world.

JODY
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent
to ponder the truth of her statement.

LANCE (O.S.)
Vince, you can come in now!

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly
appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly
personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult
life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and
has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a
""Speed Racer"" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

LANCE
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very
good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce – those are friend
prices – but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went.  Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
madman.

VINCENT
Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam.

LANCE
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No.  You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT
That's a bold statement.

LANCE
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse
to death.

VINCENT
Give me three hundred worth of the
madman.  If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
high?

VINCENT
Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?

LANCE
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the ""faux pas.""

VINCENT
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE
No problem?

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
up).

VINCENT
You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE
Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT
Mucho gracias.

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

LANCE
Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT
You know what some fucker did to it
the other day?

LANCE
What?

VINCENT
Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE
Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days – five days,
and some dickless piece of shit fucks
with it.

LANCE
They should be fuckin' killed. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

As he cooks his heroin...

VINCENT
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck
another man's vehicle.

CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP – BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB

Pushing down on the plunger.

Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle,
and then pours it into a glass.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

Mia sniffs the cocaine.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the
wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record.
The Dusty Springfield song stops.

MIA
Let's go.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an ""Archie"" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: ""Next best thing to a time machine.""

VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?

MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.

VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
the wall

(""ROCK ALL NIGHT,"" ""HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,"" ""ATTACK OF
THE CRAB MONSTER,"" and ""MACHINE GUN KELLY""). The booths that
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
on the wall states, ""No shoes allowed."" Some wannabe beboppers
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting
a big button on his chest that says: ""Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
you please me.""

BUDDY
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
vanilla coke.

BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger –
bloody – and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA
Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar
shake?

MIA
Sure did.

VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA
Uh-huh.

VINCENT
It costs five dollars?

BUDDY
Yep.

VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or
anything?

BUDDY
Nope.

VINCENT
Just checking.

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
fool.

MIA
Whaddya think?

VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse
rate.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him –

MIA
What are you doing?

VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.

MIA
Here?

VINCENT
It's just tobacco.

MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
me one, cowboy?

As he finishes licking it –

VINCENT
You can have this one, cowgirl.

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
hand. He lights it.

MIA
Thanks.

VINCENT
Think nothing of it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

MIA
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam.

VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT
What was it?

MIA
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called ""Fox Force Five.""

VINCENT
What?

MIA
""Fox Force Five."" Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show ""Baton Rouge,"" she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me.  We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
was sex...

VINCENT
What was your specialty?

MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist – when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA
Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT
Tell me.

MIA
No. It's really corny.

VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed.

VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh.

MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know
it.

MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?

VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
much.

VINCENT
What a gyp.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
the straw of her shake.

MIA
Yummy!

VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
tastes like.

MIA
Be my guest.

She slides the shake over to him.

MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA
Kooties I can handle.

He takes a sip.

VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
good milk shake.

MIA
Told ya.

VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
good.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

MIA
Don't you hate that?

VINCENT
What?

MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT
I don't know.

MIA
That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence.

VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
other.

MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
the bathroom and powder my nose,
while you sit here and think of
something to say.

VINCENT
I'll do that.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you?

VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroe's section.

MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn
Monroes.

VINCENT
No there's not.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe...

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

VINCENT
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off.

MIA
Pretty smart.

VINCENT
I have moments.

MIA
Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you.

MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say.

VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get
offended.

MIA
You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.

MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT
Is that a fact?

Mia nods her head: ""Yes.""

MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you
don't have permission.

VINCENT
What do you think about what happened
to Antwan?

MIA
Who's Antwan?

VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA
He fell out of a window.

VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.

MIA
Is that a fact?

VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA
Who told you this?

VINCENT
They.

Mia and Vincent smile.

MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT
They certainly do.

MIA
Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?

Vincent is slow to answer.

MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it
involve the F-word?

VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage.

MIA
And...?

VINCENT
No and, that's it.

MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?

VINCENT
Yeah.

MIA
And you believed that?

VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.

MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you.

MIA
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT
But did it happen?

MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding
– then never again.  The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing
circle.

CUT TO:

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
contest.

Patrons cheer.

Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...Now, who will be our first
contestants?

Mia holds her hand.

MIA
Right here.

Vincent reacts.

MIA
I wanna dance.

VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
believe Marsellus, my husband, your
boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy.

VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.

MIA
So, dance good.

VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first
contestants.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
is your name?

MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can
do. Take it away!

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's ""YOU NEVER CAN TELL"".
They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
ahead.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
face.

MIA
(like you would say
Bingo!)
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
himself in the mirror.

VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.

LIVING ROOM

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
fat line.

CLOSEUP – MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
dialogue with the mirror.

VINCENT
...It's a moral test of yourself,
whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
meaningful.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say ""Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening,"" go home, and
jack off.  And that's all you're
gonna do.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Slack-jawed.

VINCENT
OH Jesus Christ!
Jesus Fuckin Christ
Oh Fuck me

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

VINCENT
(yelling to Mia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on
your feet.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting
like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when
he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag
of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches
a number.

Vincent

Answer
FUCK YOU LANCE ANSWER!

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, ""TAFT,
CALIFORNIA"", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in
an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
Stooges, and they're getting married.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call this late!

LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is?
You're not supposed to be callin' me
this fuckin' late.

BACK TO:

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
conversation.

VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
to your place.

LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
the problem?

VINCENT
You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.

VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's
fuckin'  Doing on me.

LANCE
Don't bring her here!  I'm not even
fuckin' joking with you, don't you
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
to my house!

VINCENT
No choice.

LANCE
She's ODin'?

VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT
Negative.

LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
fucked her up, you deal with it –
are you talkin' to me on a cellular
phone?

VINCENT
Sorry.

LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't
come here, I'm hangin' up.
prank caller, PRANK CALLER!

VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out
of SHATTERS from the impact.

JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front
lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
out.

LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone –

VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!

LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
through the hall into the living room.

JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
out here?

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference
here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

JODY
Who's she?

Lance looks up at Jody.

LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I
have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY
What's wrong with her?

VINCENT
She's ODing on us.

JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY
Don't yell and me!

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking
for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
get a medical book.

VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years
and you never used it?

LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT
Well then get it.

LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
to her.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
""Come on,"" endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.

Jody calls to LANCE.

JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?

LANCE
My black medical book!

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
Jody appears in the doorway.

JODY
Whata're you looking for?

LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY
I never saw a medical book.

LANCE
Trust me, I have one.

JODY
Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?

Lance spins toward her.

LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're
never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling
you to clean this room –

VINCENT (O.S.)
– get your ass in here, fuck the
book!

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
reenters the room.

VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her
the shot!

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt
off and find her heart.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?

LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
her an injection in the heart, so I
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her
heart is, I think it's here.

Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and
nods.

LANCE
That's it.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got
one?

JODY
What?

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
would be great.

JODY
Hold on.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to
do.

VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT
I've never does this before.

LANCE
I've never done this before either,
and I ain't starting now. You brought
'er here, that means you give her
the shot. The day I bring an ODing
bitch to your place, then I gotta
give her the shot.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
marker in her hand.

JODY
Got it.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?

LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce
through that. So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like ""The
Shape"" killing its victims in ""HALLOWEEN"".

VINCENT
I gotta stab her?

LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart, you gotta stab
her hard.

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

VINCENT
What happens after that?

LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it
like –
(snaps his fingers)
– that.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

VINCENT
Count to three.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know
what to expect.

LANCE
One...

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...two...

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...three!

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline
out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck
in her chest – SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of
air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

LANCE
If you're okay, say something.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
relatively normal voice.

MIA
Something.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
shaking from how close to death Mia came.

JODY
Anybody want a beer?

CUT TO:

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says
anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
toward her front door.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
distance between the two.

VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?

MIA
What's yours?

VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident.

Mia smiles.

MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you.

VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.

MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT
Let's shake on it.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
shake and shake they do.

VINCENT
Mum's the word.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

MIA
You still wanna hear my ""FOX FORCE
FIVE"" joke?

Vincent turns around.

VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh.

MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT
I can't wait.

MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him –
(stamps on the ground)
– and says: catch up.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP On the cartoon ""SPEED RACER.""  Speed is giving a
detailed description of all the features on his race car
""The Mac-5,"" which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.

DISSOLVE TO:

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
boy.

MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.

MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
accent.

CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together.  Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.

BUTCH
I'm ready.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him
on with the robe, which says on the back: ""BATTLING BUTCH
COOLIDGE"".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for
Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,
empty locker room.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

""THE GOLD WATCH""

We hear over the black and white title:

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
– Well Dan, that had to be the
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most
brutal fight this city has ever seen.

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
inside.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named
ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,
sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a
white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of
boxing?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundation. But it's of
paramount importance that during the
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

CLICK – Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,
HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through
the rearview mirror:

ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to
pick up?

BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the
guy you're supposed to pick up.

ESMARELDA
Where to?

BUTCH
Outta here.

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?

MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the
dinner.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table –
dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a
cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.

INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
find the roll bar.

BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back
here?

ESMARELDA
I have to do it.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?

BUTCH
(still working on the
glove)
What?

ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio – you're the fighter?

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH
(drying himself with
a gym towel)
I'm him.

ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH
He's dead?

ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.

He finished wiping himself down.

BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?

BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of
them cigarettes, I'll give you an
answer.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

ESMARELDA
Deal!

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in
it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

BUTCH
So...

He looks at her license.

BUTCH
...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that
Mexican?

ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm
Columbian.

BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA
It mean ""Esmarelda of the wolves.""

BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got
there, sister.

ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH
Butch.

ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to
kill a man –

BUTCH
– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know
he was dead 'til you told me he was
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you
wanna know how I feel about it?

Esmarelda nods her head: ""yes.""

BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit
bad.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you
spread it around with?

(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news – I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.

BUTCH
(to himself in French
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.

Handing her the money.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.

BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans.

He gives her the bill.

BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

FABIENNE
Keep the light off.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in
babytalk.

FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH
Uh-huh?

FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and
you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy.

BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you
do.

FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
when she did ""Lucky Star,"" it's not
the same thing.

BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
belly.

FABIENNE
The difference is huge.

BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to
accentuate it.

BUTCH
You think guys would find that
attractive?

FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find
attractive. It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the
same.

BUTCH
If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
it.

FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH
Right in the belly.

FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
right on your face 'til you couldn't
breathe.

BUTCH
You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE
Yes!

BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Yes, I did.

BUTCH
Good job.

FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were
you the winner?

BUTCH
I won alright.

FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?

BUTCH
Sure am.

FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?

BUTCH
Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no
more?!

BUTCH
Not no more.

FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

Butch nods his head: ""yes.""

FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

Butch nods his head: ""yes.""

FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?

Butch nods his head: ""no.""

FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?

Butch nods his head: ""yes.""

FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a
nuisance -

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

FABIENNE
Say it!

BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE
Forever?

BUTCH
...and ever.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

FABIENNE
Do you love me?

BUTCH
Oui.

FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

BUTCH
Will you kiss it?

She nods her head: ""yes.""

FABIENNE
But you first.

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FABIENNE
(in French, with
English subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
head out.

BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.

BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back!  Can I have a towel please,
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
on her head.

BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
back.

She hands him a towel.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE
Butch?

BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?

BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in
Bora Bora?

BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
el zapataria?

FABIENNE
What does that mean?

BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
my little mama ceta in no time.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?

FABIENNE
Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?

FABIENNE
What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
two, then she remember something.

FABIENNE
Butch.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

FABIENNE
Forget it.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film ""THE LOSERS"".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
him.

His start startles Fabienne.

FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have
a bad dream?

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

BUTCH
What are you watching?

FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
name.

BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?

Fabienne enters the room.

FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?

BUTCH
Would you please?

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war.

FABIENNE
What was it about?

BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it.

Fabienne laughs.

FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?

BUTCH
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.

BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
don't remember.

FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
in your sleep?

BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
in my sleep?

FABIENNE
You did last night.

BUTCH
What did I say?

Laying on top of him.

FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand
you.

She kisses Butch.

FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes.

BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

FABIENNE
Satisfied?

BUTCH
Yep.

FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

BUTCH
What time is it?

FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?

BUTCH
Eleven.

FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH
(surprised at her
potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?

Butch is finished dressing.

FABIENNE
(referring to his
clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.

As he goes through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese –

BUTCH
– where's my watch?

FABIENNE
It's there.

BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE
Have you looked?

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

He's now throwing clothes.

BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

FABIENNE
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
–

BUTCH
– on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH
Well it's not here!

FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!

BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
menacing.

BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE
I believe so...

BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE
Then I did.

BUTCH
Are you sure?

FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
mind reader.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

FABIENNE
I'm sorry.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?

BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch.

FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for
you there?

BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split.

Rising from the floor.

FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE
Don't go.

BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say,
blueberry pie.

FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.

BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
Okay?  Okay?

FABIENNE
Okay.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE
Bye.

BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE
Okay.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
fists as he drives down the street.

BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. ""Bedside table – on the
kangaroo."" I said the words: ""Don't
forget my father's watch.""

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.

CUT TO:

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY – DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name ""Teriyaki Donut"" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears
disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of ""Ring Magazine"" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
""MODESTY BLAISE"" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA – DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building.

INT. HONDA – DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
Butch.  They keep underestimatin'
ya.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he
SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: ""Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?""

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

BUTCH
I guess.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
gather around the body.

GAWKER #1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

GAWKER #2
If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
that car.

MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?

GAWKER #2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street, looking a shambles.

MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back
away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
him.

BUTCH
Sacre bleu.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
screaming.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
sign that reads ""MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP"".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
Butch RACES into his world.

MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH
Shut up!

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
next to the door.

MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute
–

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
of his middle finger.

BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch
then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
shield the splatter.

BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught
me –

MAYNARD (O.S.)
– hold it right there, godammit!

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your
business –

MAYNARD
– I'm makin' it my business! Now
toss that gun!

Butch does.

MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to
the counter.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
caught a coupl'a flies.

Marsellus passes out.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are
two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and
a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are
unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in
his belt.

MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.

A BUZZER buzzes.

MAYNARD
That's Zed.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
long time, then says:

ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD
I did.

ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?

Butch makes no reply.

ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
of this place?

MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED
No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.

ZED
Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
up then, won't you?

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises
THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
then backs away.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

MAYNARD
Who's first?

ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent ""Eenie, meany,
miney, moe... "" just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

ZED
Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
room.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
the ceiling.

MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.

The Gimp bows its head: ""yes."" Maynard disappears into
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
in 'em!

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Good, I like to fight!

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it... that's it boy, you're
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
that... that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
hold 'em!

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

THE GIMP
Huhng?

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon ""DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER"" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched
positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden
horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,
which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

BUTCH
You okay?

MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
okay!

Long pause.

BUTCH
What now?

MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what
now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
on homes here with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
ain't through with you by a damn
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
your ass.

BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and
you?

MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
ya what now between me an' you. There
is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH
So we're cool?

MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
ask – two things I ask: Don't tell
nobody about this. This shit's between
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It
ain't nobody else's business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
when you're gone, stay gone.  You've
lost your Los Angeles privileges.
Deal?

BUTCH
Deal.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
bit of a situation.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name ""GRACE"" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a ""Frankie says,
Relax"" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a
BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named ""GRACE.""
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?

BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE
You're hurt?

BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her
hand.

BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?

FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a
little)
It was good –

BUTCH
– did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk –
are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH
It's a chopper.

FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH
Zed's.

FABIENNE
Who's Zed?

BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

""JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF""

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!

JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men...""

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly
CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

JULES (O.S.)
""...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And
you will know I am the Lord when I
lay my vengeance upon you.""

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around
is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his
hand cannon.

FOURTH MAN
Die... die... die... die...!

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion
crosses his face.

TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, ""Are we hit?"" They're
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

FOURTH MAN
I don't understand –

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs
it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your
mind?  Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?

JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.

VINCENT
.357.

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else.

Vincent prepares to leave.

VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.

JULES
That was... divine intervention. You
know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means.
That's exactly what it means! God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

VINCENT
I think we should be going now.

JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do
that!  Don't blow this shit off!
What just happened was a fuckin'
miracle!

VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.

JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen.

VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the
jailhouse with the cops?

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my
friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge
it!

VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we
leave now?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and
Marvin in the back.

VINCENT
...Ever seen that show ""COPS?""  I
was watchin' it once and this cop
was on it who was talkin' about this
time he got into this gun fight with
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on
this guy and he doesn't hit anything.
And these guys were in a hallway.
It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my
eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?

JULES
That's it for me. For here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

JULES
Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules –

JULES
– I said don't do that –

VINCENT
– you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm
through.

VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell
'im why.

JULES
Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off.

JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his
grip.

VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came
down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets?

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES
blood and SHAKES.

JULES
What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT
Aww man, I shot Marvin in the face

JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it
was an accident.

JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in
my time –

VINCENT
– chill out, man, it was an accident,
okay? You hit a bump or somethin'
and the gun went off.

JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'
bump!

VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went
off, don't ask me how!

JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin'
around on a city street in broad
daylight –

VINCENT
– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'
about the splatter.

JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this
car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you're driving a car
drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly
place?

JULES
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley.

VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your
town, Jules.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

VINCENT
Who ya callin'?

JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES
On the other side of the hill, by
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass
ain't home, I don't know what the
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any
other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are
in some serious shit. We're in a car
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I
need to use your garage for a couple
hours.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while
Vincent stands behind him.

JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie's situation. He's
one remark away from kickin' our
asses out the door.

VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made
a couple phone calls. But I never
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's
my friend and you don't bust in your
friend's house and start tellin' 'im
what's what.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at
the sink.

VINCENT
Just tell I'm not to be abusive. He
kinda freaked out back there when he
saw Marvin.

JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's
eight o'clock in the morning. He
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for
this shit. Don't forget who's doin'
who a favor.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta
take shit, he can stick his favor
straight up his ass.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is
stained with red.

JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?

VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.

JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,
I coulda done a better job.

JULES
I used the same soap you did and
when I dried my hands, the towel
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who
cares? But it's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation to a boil.
If he were to come in here and see
that towel like that... I'm tellin'
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie
on account of you... Look, I ain't
threatenin' you, I respect you an'
all, just don't put me in that
position.

JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no
problem. He's your friend, you handle
him.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in
his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
been satisfied with freeze-dried
Tasters Choice. You spring this
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
flavor is this?

JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.

JULES
What?

JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, ""Dead nigger storage?""

Jules starts to ""Jimmie"" him –

JIMMIE
– answer to question. Did you see a
sign out in front of my house that
said, ""Dead nigger storage?""

JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that
sign?

JULES
Why?

JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!

Jules starts to ""Jimmie"" him.

JIMMIE
– I ain't through! Now don't you
understand that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage
counselor, no trial separation –
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced. The last time
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
was gonna be the last time me an'
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I
wanna help ya out Julie, I really
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife
doin' it.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'
you can say that's gonna make me
forget I love my wife. Now she's
workin' the graveyard shift at the
hospital. She'll be comin' home in
less than an hour and a half. Make
your phone calls, talk to your people,
than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna
fuck up your shit. We just need to
call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's
in my bedroom.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy
robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

MARSELLUS
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

JULES
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie
situation is. If she comes home from
a hard day's work and finds a bunch
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'
what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm
doin' is contemplating the ""ifs.""

JULES
I don't wanna hear about no
motherfuckin' ""ifs.""What I wanna
hear from your ass is: ""you ain't
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill
them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be comin'
directly.""

MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in
there, chill them niggers out and
wait for The Wolf, who should be
comin' directly.

JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS
Feel better?

JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to
say.

INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite
into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a
fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in
fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:
Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the
tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka ""THE WOLF"". We also see The
Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules...

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

""1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)
Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)""

THE WOLF
...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

HE WRITES:

""Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)""

THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's
about thirty minutes away. I'll be
there in ten.

He hangs up. We never see his face.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

""NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER""

CUT TO:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at
Jimmie.

THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your
house?

JIMMIE
Yeah.

THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE
Please do.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE
100%.

THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie...
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
that correct?

JIMMIE
Uh-huh.

THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE
She won't at that.

THE WOLF
That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,
circling it.

THE WOLF
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Yes.

THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?

JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?

JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's
cool.

THE WOLF
Positive?  Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
don't work.

JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the
three men the plan of action.

THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and
Vincent)
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?

JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe
down the upholstery – now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up.  But the
windows are a different story.  Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.  Jimmie –
lead the way, boys – get to work.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

VINCENT
(calling after him)
A ""please"" would be nice.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

THE WOLF
Come again?

VINCENT
I said a ""please"" would be nice.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say ""please.""I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
luck gentlemen.

JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
me.

THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he
has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
somethin' –

THE WOLF
– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

JIMMIE
You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore –

THE WOLF
– let me ask you a question, if you
don't mind?

JIMMIE
Sure.

THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?

JIMMIE
No.

THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of
bills)
I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?

JIMMIE
Oak's nice.

INT. GARAGE – MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs
of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

JULES
I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit!

VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?

JULES
Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass.

VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow.

JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm ""SUPERFLY T.N.T,"" I'm the ""GUNS
OF NAVARONE."" I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
nigger's skull.

INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript
vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a
good job they've done.

THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
of this yet.

JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF
Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
clean you two.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.

THE WOLF
Strip.

VINCENT
All the way?

THE WOLF
To your bare ass.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?

THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?

VINCENT
What?

THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag.

JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away.

THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

THE WOLF
Towel 'em.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
across their bodies.

THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
we first met.

THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them.

JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me.  Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
something.

(TO JULES)
What did I say?

JULES
Don't do shit unless –

THE WOLF
– unless what?

JULES
Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
jangling?

VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his
car keys)
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

JULES
We cool?

WINSTON
Like it never happened.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.

RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do ""I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE,"" you guys,
I'd be great.  What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?

VINCENT
Redondo Beach.

JULES
Inglewood.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
""DEAD ZONE"" trance.

WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Winston turns to leave.

JULES
Mr. Wolf.

He turns around.

JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

The Wolf smiles.

WINSTON
Call me Winston.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character.

RAQUEL
I have character.

WINSTON
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

JULES
Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT
You know I could go for some
breakfast.  Want to have breakfast
with me?

JULES
Sure.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
refill for both men,

VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's
nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?

JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT
Are you Jewish?

JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
on swine.

VINCENT
Why not?

JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat
filthy animals.

VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.

JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces.

VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces.

JULES
I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

The two men laugh.

VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?

JULES
The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
a freak occurrence.

JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT
An act of God.

JULES
What's an act of God?

VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
this morning qualifies.

JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved.

VINCENT
But why?

JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
to sleep.

VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really
gonna quit?

JULES
The life, most definitely.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life,
what'll you do?

JULES
That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES
You know, like Caine in ""KUNG FU.""
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures.

VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the
earth?

JULES
Until God puts me where he want me
to be.

VINCENT
What if he never does?

JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait
forever.

VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?

JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no
more, no less.

VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

JULES
Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ –

VINCENT
– what happened was peculiar – no
doubt about it – but it wasn't water
into wine.

JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
scary questions.

VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?!

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
out, COCKING IT.

PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on
the floor.

HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
terrified.

PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
here!  Asta luego!

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all –

Pumpkin heads his way.

PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
Manager's neck.

PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me
a problem?

MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
any problem!

PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
anything you want.

PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
be all over.

MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
soon!

PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
on the ground.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
reads his ""MODESTY BLAISE"" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.

PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
respectful, him manner more on guard.

PUMPKIN
In the bag.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

PUMPKIN
What's in that?

JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES
When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.

JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
thing.

PUMPKIN
Open it up.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
hammer.

PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.

JULES
Yes, you did.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.

HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last.

MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here.

JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
business!

PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Clear? One...

PUMPKIN
...two... three.

JULES
You win.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN
Open it.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
the room, can't see shit.

HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?

Jules nods his head: ""yes.""

PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.

Jules nods his head: ""yes.""

HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!

JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.

JULES
Promise her.

PUMPKIN
I promise.

JULES
Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN
Just chill out.

JULES
What's her name?

PUMPKIN
Yolanda.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
at Pumpkin.

JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.

JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
what' Fonzie like?

No answer.

JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?

JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

Pumpkin looks at him.

JULES
One... two... three.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!

JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool.  When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous.  When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
Yolanda.

JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
cool.

VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT
Check.

JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I.  It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet.

PUMPKIN
Which one is it?

JULES
It's the one that says Bad
Motherfucker on it.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet
with ""Bad Motherfucker"" embroidered on it.

JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
much is there?

PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score.

VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle.

JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN
What?

JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
read the Bible?

PUMPKIN
Not regularly.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you."" I been sayin' that shit for
years.  And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
takes a sip of coffee.

JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.

JULES
That's probably a good idea.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
– wearing UC Santa Cruz and ""I'm with Stupid"" tee-shirts,
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word.

I'm lookin for a place to go so I can be all alone
From thoughts and memories
So that when the music plays I don't go back to the days
When love was you and me

Oh, oh...
Moja droga, ja cię kocham
Means that I love you so
Moja droga, ja cię kocham
More than you'll ever know
Kocham ciebie całym serce
Love you with all my heart
Return to me, and always be

Wish I had a place to hide all my sorrow, all my pride
I just can't get along
'cause the love once so fine keeps on hurtin all the time
Where did I go wrong?

I been, I been looking on the motherfuckin’ internet
And I been seeing a lot of niggas on Gram with fake busted ass things
If you from Philly
And you rep for Meek Milly, make some fuckin’ noise
You don’t wanna see my Philly niggas hanging out the window
Like we’re tryna spot Ricky
And shout out to the niggas that showed me they not with me
Shit, I don’t think it’s bout no rapping, it’s about Nicki
He told us he was first in line but it got tricky
I still wake up with the lady that you said you first in line with
Did five months, came home, that’s perfect timing
To make a sucka nigga look sucka without trying
If Quentin Miller wrote that shit, why were we buying?
Might as well go and get his tape, is he good or is he great?
Niggas turn to hoes, Caitlyn Jenners turn to Drizzy Drakes
Woah shit, we in Philly right?
See I represent the niggas that come from the bottom
If you started from nothing, make some fuckin' noise in this bitch
I said when I first seen my homie sitting in the casket
Is when I first went to get the ratchet
Shit is real, the fuckin' crackers itching to do me like Emmett Till
And I can smell death in the air and you the kill
When you was still out in the field toting them Glocks
Man, he was still with wheelchair Jimmy rolling them blocks
My momma used to hold them Berettas when it was hot
Your momma used to peek out the window and call the cops
And the nerve of y’all niggas, saying y'all started from the bottom
When the real niggas dying, cops killing, metal flying
All that bullshit you selling, real niggas never buy
Uh, I got word from the six, niggas say you testified

Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
'Cause if music and money is the motive, then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin', I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Go, go, go, go-go (Uh), go, go, go, uh
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: RetcH]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', this pill got me open
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke, but tell Butter roll a blunt
'Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own drugs and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try 'em
He'll call me RetcH, but your bitch call me Brian
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm trappin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin' (What?)
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trannies 'cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds and bitches all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine on chill and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in L.A. with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit, Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill nigga shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
Four gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' the shit, so avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to rain
Get love in the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of Hell's Kitchen praying he don't stick to the stove
God got me, illumi-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
Buy 150, let me tell y'all now, I want Nikki
Lift her up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play Problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (What)
Keep fresh just in Margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (Don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (Naw!)
Compton niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
Know once it's almost over tryin' to jerk the wheel
You nervous, like them cutters he'd inject the speed
And you think you mothafucka faking me, my nigga? (What)
Yeah I bet a nigga crawl to the crown
I'm a boss, hire hoes while I bottle out
I see them niggas shaking hands and biting styles
Got her to stay city in 'cause I fired her spouse
'Cause I'm a mad man
Just fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the Sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (Diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more .4 5's and 9's and I ain't talking bout no Js
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter, Chachi-palooza
Riding shotty in the Chevy bitch old as a cougar
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy use the porthole please
Get it good girl, use your knees, I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (For real)
Back on my Compton shit, demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (Huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (What)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(Check!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's two or three and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button (Beep)
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223 (Do, do, do ,do)
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key (Uh-huh)
Bitch we great, bitch we great (Great), fuckin' set (Set)
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get, get, we gotta get, get, we gonna take it first
We jump, said bitch we jump, we gotta make it (Yeah)
Couple racks up on them Wikki stiks
Yo bitch, she smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink 'til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga, all I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga, mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal, NY, them eagles
Fly through, get high too, fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group, come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin, boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun poundin', keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me, me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up, that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up, Hennessy, Louis V
Me and you, me and her, we as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one, freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since eight and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like ""Nigga don't move""
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk butter like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado]
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, ""What's good?""
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, ""What's good?""
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room, legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon? All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack, just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening, now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls, redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up, wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor, burning monks to feel the timbre
Part of the action, retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them, watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo Prada never gonna pile up if you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meechy Darko]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know, niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lecter
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible, I've been on my mind for days
'Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill King
Niggas stay shot, shit stay locked, I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like ""Fuck the rest""
When I need bread, I'm like ""Fuck the rest""
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game, let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, ""no way""
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
A Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real West Side nigga, 4.2 bitch
They might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
Your bitch put me high up on a nigga to-do list
You can do that, fuck nigga do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on gay shit
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's Prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Erik Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz? I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the MAC, truck bulletproofed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of Pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz? My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once, no voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 01 01, hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 01 01, hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Bimmer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Ninas
Instead, I was that nigga puffin' reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
'Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga gripper of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the worst you'll see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome, your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back, cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb and I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man, I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang, I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame, I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride, hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die, pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest, right now chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say ""fuck fate"", if I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to while I'm fine dining on YouTube, bruh
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with a Onyx on, Nefertiti on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing, these rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter, one two, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something, I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable, make sure it ain't sitting on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body, fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up, I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
'Til all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry, in backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are, I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you, then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr. 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger! Y'all got me drunk as hell, uh
Now I been red since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your bitch in the 'Lac, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, and you can roll it, roll it
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see I'm servin' foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody else to eat but her
She be like fuck them bitches, stack the digits
Compliment this Fendi fit, condiment or sentimental
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprint on my golds, they all on the seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe ring, featured by E
Bitches know it's time out
This bitch be fucking me so good, I be like, ""Time out!""
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
And how she stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like, ""Time out!""
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant 'gar, she tall like 'Zilla, I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo of an anaconda
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked, no pajamas
Lil' homie ranned off with lots of lumber
For that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a bean together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growin' wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my thing together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Mykko Montana, my father say I got stamina
I'm cooking the Hannah Montana-na, I bury these hoes like sandals them
I kill every one of my features, I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yellow pages, just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian Mercedes
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing ""daddy's home""
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it and right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh, my nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day one hundred, cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit, you just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out faster than cancer sticks
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar, Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face, hoes like ""he so angry"", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you, real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit, it's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: CUZ Lightyear (a.k.a. SL Jones)]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Looked like Joan, we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes,I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit, pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader, still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa? Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster, World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga, that's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
As far as everyone goes, they can suck and kneel on it
We have another song, gotta fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka, happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social, no, a nigga fan
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh, got those motherfucking custom Roshes, feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit, my Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson, I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic, paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt, three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the Philly
My daughter's neck is chilly, my son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth, ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep, that's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I'm ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, I'm spending
You lames and you fall, I'm like 2 Chainz when I ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
Despite sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
It's horrendous what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all 'til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em, I don't write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched and your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressin'
Scorin' high off the fresh pressses, brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good, I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper and she gave me the sloppy goooood
So you should tip her if you execute, young leisure suit
Larry with no extra loot, my ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', me like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemies
Yo what's up, see me on motherfucker tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum (drum)
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn, no shit, not zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn no shit zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz]
A muthafucka need that work? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need that thing, that thing, then I got it right here
Yeah, motherfucker, I got it right here, I got it right here
A muthafucka need that work? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need that thing, that thing, then I got it right here
Yeah muthafucka, I-- muthafucka I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
I said most of these niggas gon' hate, me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon swing, we all gon catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap, Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase, but I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time, you ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die, I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh, big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending, been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
But to our niggas, we gettin' it with that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a cake to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris, and free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off Rocky, rottweiler just to watch it
Maybachs for the profit, get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers, press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing, no tags, nigga, fuck the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne, and a 3 page spread
I was sleepin' on the flow, just a couple months later
Now I'm purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, gold for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
Target my ankh, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be ending me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A Black Clan king, respect the illustrator
Don't you dare ever try the Elohim, fuck flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up kid, put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, kill this shit
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
Gotta check up, haters still sick
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
And ya bitch came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn, the fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm all but the limousine
Swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene, yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar, like a bleedin' heart beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin' then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like Vans, I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans, go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross for all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get in your ears and the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip and just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork, I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit with a pistol, dro is full of his disorders, I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My broad on da eastside ho nigga
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it, flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it, running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get ""Faith"" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID, game need me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some game
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
Throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', ""Oh well""
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blasted, naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Commander and chief, my sons is Son of Sam with the beef
We get loot, always ran from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know? So much wax in this blunt I'm smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
You think I'm fuckin' mad, I'm too so
I'm out of it, bitch, oh, nah, fuck that
Bring them fuckin' trumpets back
Light a dub sack for my niggas who slung crack
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
Fucker I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch",Noisey,1975,"[67, 51]",2

Just say the word and I'll leave you 'lone
Instead of layin' out cryin' yo' eyes out, baby

627,Longfellow Serenade,"{Intro}

Longfellow Serenade
Such were the plans I'd made
For she was a lady
And I was a dreamer
With only words to trade

You know that I was born
For a night like this
Warmed by a stolen kiss
For I was lonely
And she was lonely

Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make your dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

I'll weave his web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On his winged flight
Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you
My Longfellow serenade

Longfellow serenade
Such were the plans I made
But she was a lady
As deep as the river
And through the night we stayed
And in my way I loved her as none before
Loved her with words and more
For she was lonely and I was lonely

Ride, come on baby, ride
Let me make your dreams come true
I'll sing my song
Let me sing my song
Let me make it warm for you

I'll weave his web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On his winged flight
Then come, and as we lay
Beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you
My Longfellow serenade

Weave your web of rhyme
Upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time
On your winged flight",Neil Diamond,1975,"[79, 61]",2
628,Ms. Grace,"Ooh ooh ooh Miss Grace
Satin and perfume and lace
The minute I saw your face
I knew that I loved you

Hey you, listen to me
I got a lot of truth I want to tell you
I just met a woman who turned me upside down
The rivers turn in their beds
Flowers bloom where she treads
She turns an awful lot of heads
When she comes to town

Miss Grace when you walk by
You're the twinkle in my eye
There's no need to wonder why
I've fallen for you

Ooh ooh ooh Miss Grace
Satin and perfume and lace
The minute I saw your face
I knew that I loved you

Strangest thing of all you see
Is that this could happen to me
Lady Grace she said she'll be so fine
Someday I'll make her mine all mine

Ooh ooh ooh Miss Grace

The minute I saw your face
I knew that I loved you

629,Words (are Impossible),"Words (Are Impossible)

Words without love are just words with no meaning
And the feeling that something has died
I can\'t hide with only words
Lose you, now the last thing I want is to lose you
But it seems like I\'m losin\' myself
I feel like someone else and not myself

Baby, words are impossible
When something\'s died
It\'s not the fame
Give me more (or \""that mean more\"")
When I\'m by your side

Pretending, not part of
At heart of

I feel like someone else
I\'m not myself


Baby, words are impossible
When something\'s died
It\'s not the fame
Give me more (or \""that mean more\"")
When I\'m by your side

Easy, to pretend nothing\'s wrong
Would be easy
But to face it when something is wrong
It\'s the hardest thing I\'ve done
Stronger, I was weak but I\'m growing much stronger
If you give me a little more time
The more I find myself the more I found

Oooh, ooh, oh, words are impossible
When something\'s died
It\'s not the fame
Give me more (or \""that mean more\"")
When I\'m by your side

Words without love have no meaning
I keep pretending
It gets harder
Sooooo, harder
Help me make it
Just a little more time, now
I\'ll get stronger
I\'ll get stronger :)",Margie Joseph,1975,"[95, 91]",2

633,Back Home Again,"[Verse 1]
There's a storm across the valley
Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon is heavy
On your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane
A mile or more away
And the whining of his wheels
Just makes it colder

[Verse 2]
He's an hour away from riding
On your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road
Are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning
Supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes
That makes him warm

[Chorus]
Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

[Verse 3]
There's all the news to tell him
How'd you spend your time
What's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday
Sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday

[Chorus]
Hey, it's good to be back home again, yes it is
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

And all the time that I can lay this tired, old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for
The love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of
Just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

Hey, it's good to be back home again, oh it is
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Hey, it's good to be back home again
I said hey, it's good to be back home again",John Denver,1975,[81],1
634,I Feel Sanctified,"Yeah, I Feel sanctified
Yeah, I Feel sanctified
Yeah, I Feel sanctified

I just left my babys house
And I got the Strength I needed
Knowing that the beast of man
Is very hard to please

I`m so glad the sun is shining
To brighten up the day
Cause behind last night
I see things in a different way

Yeah, I Feel sanctified
(Feel it, feel it my soul, yeah)
Yeah, I Feel sanctified

She led me to the peak of love
And no words could ever describe
Oh, when you get that kind of loving
It`s a blessing to be alive

Ooh, the sacred feeling
Just blows through my soul
Searching for sanctuary
To rested my???

Yeah, I Feel sanctified
Yeah, I Feel sanctified
Yeah, I Feel sanctified

She led me to the peak of love
And no words could ever describe
Oh, when you get that kind of loving
It`s a blessing to be alive

Ooh, the sacred feeling
Just blows through my soul
Searching for sanctuary
To rested my???

Yeah, I Feel sanctified
Yeah, I Feel sanctified
Yeah, I Feel sanctified",Commodores,1975,[86],1
635,I Wouldn't Treat A Dog (The Way You Treated Me),"Well, mm hmm, listen

When I was up
You would always come around
But when I needed a friend
Oh, you could never be found

I got a hole where
My heart used to be
I wouldn't treat a dog, no, no
The way you treated me

When time was good, Lord
All your loving was the same
But when the going got rough
You hardly knew my name

You locked me up and
You threw away the key
I wouldn't treat a dog, oh my Lord
The way you treated me

Got me crying for
A love that I needed
Begging like a dog for a bone

Although I spent all
Of my time pleading
You turned your back
And you leave me

One of these old days
Lord knows, and it's true
Just when you need me the most
I'll walk right out on you

And you'll say as you're
Begging down on your knees
Bobby, I wouldn't treat a dog
No, no, no, the way you treated me
The way you treated me

I wouldn't treat a dog, no, no
I wouldn't do it to you
I wouldn't treat a dog, no, Lord
The way you treated me

Oh, I wouldn't do it
I couldn't do it...",Bobby “Blue” Bland,1975,[93],1
