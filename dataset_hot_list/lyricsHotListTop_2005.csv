0,Don't Forget About Us,"[Intro]
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy

[Verse 1]
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Verse 2]
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Bridge]
And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
So why you act like you don't know how this loving used to be?
I bet she can't do it like me, she'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you, babe
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Outro]
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us",Mariah Carey,2005,"[1, 2, 7, 12, 11, 17, 20, 26, 36, 56, 81]",11

We yell, ""Gang-gang first,"" you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear

I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on, everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, I wasn't there, your Honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to balley, get a brib, I'm ballin'
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, ""Fuck it, no problem, it'll do""
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)

2,Grillz,"[Intro: Paul Wall]
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold

[J.D.]
Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is... So So Def

[Verse 1: Nelly & Brandy]
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 more at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cause when I...
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do baby, it's the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

[Hook]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)

[Verse 3: Ali & Gipp]
[Gipp]
Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
[Ali]
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em, on the top, on the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
[Gipp]
I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry
[Ali]
I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold)

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side

8,Because Of You,"[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

11,One Wish,"Can I talk to you for a minute?

You know, I be thinking to myself
We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
We did everything together

Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)

Use to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days
(One wish, one wish, one wish)

(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
If I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good
(One wish)
One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish

[Intro]
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

[Verse 2]
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part & be buying the bar

You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up

Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but

Close the window, when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo

I just might not bring my own 'cause them niggas there let me smoke for free

The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at

15,When I'm Gone,"[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Of what used to be
That's the reason

And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it

And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own

Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump

Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'tel you in
Crack braggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn’t know you, 'cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips ‘cause I don’t have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here, ’cause baby

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together

Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

Singing to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""

So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin' tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me

Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet

Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?

He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind

Let herself go on a singles cruise
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu

She poured her heart and soul into their three-bedroom ranch
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironing his pants
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go

Let herself go on her first blind date
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake
Let herself go buy a brand new car
Drove it down to the beach he always said was too far
Sand sure felt good between her toes

What I see in your eyes words can't come close
No matter what your father says I just want you to know
That you're a beautiful person, and I want you to grow
The way he talks to you's just so inappro
I hope that you're strong, when he's doing you wrong
And I hope you find comfort in the words of these songs
Now sing along and while I tell you this story just listen closely
I know you like my music but look, you don't really know me
See I live outside the city where there's nothing going on
I just look around for meaning while I'm sitting on my lawn
One day I met this girl and she was beautiful too
I look closely at her eyes, a nice light shade of blue
She was still in high school, I was one year removed
We're both a little older from the things we've been through
Pretty soon I started seeing all the things he would do
She wasn't black and blue but emotionally bruised
It made me so mad I didn't know what to do
Told her no matter what, I'mma be there for you
But as things became more hectic in my life I started fadin' out
Began to lie to her, I wasn't fair to her, I hate it now
I hope that you can understand my honesty
I really fuckin' wanna knock that dude out honestly
You don't have to believe it but I think about you every day
I sing about you every way cause you're the perfect melody
I know the world ain't perfect but to me you were my everything
My little light of sunshine I'm holdin' on for better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

[Verse 2]
I wanna go back where we were sittin' at that ice cream shop
I'm lookin' at you in your eyes I'm feelin' like my heart has stopped
You laugh at me for gettin' soy peanut butter
Back then I thought (shit, nah)
I don't need no other person in my life and nothing else don't even matter to me
Maybe I'm so numb that nothin' bad can ever happen to me
Maybe I'm so evil I attract all of these tragedies
Maybe we're so graceful we create all of these masterpieces
So facetious we would laugh about it
Nobody can reach us for a half an hour sleepin' in my half-apartment we don't have to watch the news
I never felt more comfortable my face so close to you
And I'mma break it down for you
I think about you every day I sing about you every way cause you're the perfect melody
I know the world ain't perfect but to me you were my everything
My little light of sunshine I'm holdin' on for better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

[Verse 3]
What does it mean if I don't know what love feels like
My parents got divorced when I was young so I just feel like
Examples that I have to look upon are probably not great
Knowing you're in a similar position doesn't make it O.K
I'm feeling like my goal is to make these blue skies turn grey
But in the blink of an eye it could go away
So even if it's just for ten minutes I wanna drive around with you
And think about our life in the present these are our better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

I am the visual, the inspiration

I'm the spark that makes your idea bright
The same spark that lights the dark

58,Good Ride Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
From the hills to Kaycee, Wyoming
Where life's wooly and wild
Came an Air Force brat
In a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile
And from bucking broncs
To honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy's song
We were much too young
Having too much fun
As we all sang along

[Chorus]
(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

[Verse 2]
From gold buckles to gold records
Well, once again he was spinning 'round
Took the whole world on
And he turned us on
To that Western Underground
And from ""Bareback Jack""
To ""This Cowboy's Hat""
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down
From town to town
Like children running through the rain

[Chorus]
(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

59,Soul Meets Body,"[Verse 1]
I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And bathe my skin in water, cool and cleansing and feel
Feel what it's like to be new
'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
Where they're far more suited than here

[Verse 2]
Well, I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

[Chorus]
I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So, brown eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

[Bridge]
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body

[Chorus]
And I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So, brown eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

60,Don't Bother,"[Verse 1]
She's got the kind of look that defies gravity
She's the greatest cook
And she's fat free (Fat free, fat free, fat free)
She's been to private school
And she speaks perfect French
She's got her perfect friends
Oh, isn't she cool?
She practices Tai Chi
She'd never lose her nerve
She's more than you deserve
She's just far better than me
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry
And don't bother, I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

[Verse 2]
I'm sure she doesn't know
How to touch you like I would
I beat her at that one good
Don't you think so?
She's almost six feet tall
She must think I'm a flea
I'm really a cat, you see
And it's not my last life at all
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry
Don't bother, I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

[Bridge]
For you, I'd give up all I own
And move to a communist country
If you came with me, of course
And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you
And lose those pounds, learn about football
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Promise you won't ever see me cry
And after all, I'm glad that I'm not your type
Promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't bother
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Promise you won't ever see me cry
And after all, I'm glad that I'm not your type

61,When I Get Where I'm Going,"[Verse 1]
When I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain

[Chorus]
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna walk with my grand daddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
So much work to do

[Verse 5]
But when I get where I'm going
And I see my maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of his amazing grace
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Hallelujah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm going
Yeah when I get where I'm going",Brad Paisley,2005,"[62, 72, 71, 81, 81]",5

Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment (Uh-uh)

I go on and on and on and
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""But I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
I threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

I've gotta go...

Woke up intoxicated from the night before (Night before)
Got so fucking faded I slept on the floor (On the floor)
Don't know whose house this is or where I'm at
Don't know how I made it, gotta find the door
Uh, I'm making bad decisions frequently
Tuesdays I'm exactly the same person that's the weekend me
And recently my girl's friends had told her who they see me with
But it's no secret, baby, cause we both know I'm a piece of shit
Uh, you see the FOMO is forever real
Try to take it easy truth be told but I could never chill
I be out with party girls who all be off of hella pills
And after shows they all just want to come to my hotel and chill
I walk to the bathroom and she follow (And she follow)
We do it all tonight and then regret it all tomorrow (It all tomorrow)
Yeah, see it's the lifestyles of the young and dumb
Get fucked up too often I think I might be becoming numb

When in New Orleans that's just how it goes
In the city where the bars don't ever close
Yeah, everything is justified inside
When you're still out drunk at five and on the ride
Yeah, uh, I'm waving at the morning joggers
I'm just leaving the bar, stumbling off a dozen lagers
Too much whiskey, too much white, think I might call it a night
The sun is up I'll take her home, tomorrow's not goin' feel alright
Nope, nope
When you realize what you did
And the guilt makes your stomach turn now you just feel so stupid
So you have a beer for breakfast and a blunt gets included
Try forget that you slept with your ex, you can't dispute it
Nope, nope
Nothing like coming down while waking up
Drinking beers while cooking bacon up
That first half hour on your feet will have you shaken up
Just wash down the stress with two Dos Equis then you're straightened up
Yeah, yeah

70,Shake,"[JACQUES]
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

Just to make sure I ain't forgot that
She's gone

[Verse 3]
You know my psychiatrist said, ""Tell me what do you see
When you look at these ink spots of reds and yellows and green?""
You know, I looked at them all, but all they looked to me like
Big blue notes

[Chorus]
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing that's left to do for me

[Verse 4]
Is stand high on this cliff overlooking the sea
With my big blue note paper airplane that I just set free
And I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes
And if it don't come back to me
You guessed it
She's gone

77,Bat Country,"[Intro]
He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man

[Verse 1]
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

[Verse 2]
As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

[Post-Chorus]
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

[Bridge]
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

[Hook]
I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)

My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)

So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

I got miles of trouble spreading far and wide
Bills on the table getting higher and higher
They just keep on coming, there ain't no end in sight
I'm just holding on tight
I've got someone who loves me more then words can say
And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still it's hard to find faith

[Chorus]
But if you can look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me believe

It's just day to day trying to make ends meet
What I'd give for an address out on easy street
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind

What's the deal with my brain?
Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain
There's the pitch, slow and straight
All I have to do is swing
And I'm a hero, but I'm a zero

[Verse 2]
Hungry nights, once again
Now it's getting unbelievable
Cause I could not have it better
But I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto
And I just pass through

Get your hands off the girl

And I don't appreciate this excess company
Though, I can't satisfy all the needs she has
And so she starts to wander
Can you blame her?

Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs (lean!)
I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera

Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out, Giussepe steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats

All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me ""Your Majesty""

My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit

I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows

I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain

Light of God dimming weak
Nothing's wrong go back to sleep
Lost the will at infancy
Drown them in charity
Lend them comfort for sorrow
Enthusiasm they borrow
I can clean impurity
Wash away with kerosene

Can't offend my modesty
Thank you for defiling me
Language pure as binary
Instruct with dishonesty
In nature there's no tragedy
Bandage them in tapestry
Trade comfort for identity
Drown me in kerosene

Strictly presidential (get money), yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas givin' orders now
The gold Presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walkin' on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceilin'
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feelin'
Got my seats on the wood, playas givin' me dap
Lyor like how I move, Warner right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentionin' Meek
Went and bought a new crib, week of Wale release
Bitches, the king comin', Billie Jean thumpin'
I need to hear the trumpets, meanin' machine gunnin'
I ain't missin' nothin', got her sippin' somethin'
I could ship her somethin', you know that December comin'

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's (get money) who we are, baby (get money)
All I ever need is girls and green (get money)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Ugh, may see me leanin' in some new shit
Now it's gold Presidentials for the crew shit
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talkin' foolish
I was skippin' the classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a prophet stuffin' my pockets, you niggas starvin'
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wang
Gold Presidential VS when I change the game

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty

Ugh, she wanna roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My nigga's up the road come and get it now
60-40 no we split it up the middle now
Shawty's said the word, I was talkin' that talk
Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
3rd floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers 'til the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Ugh! Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat: wet wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
(I love you..) white tee, gold Rolex

Music to my ear, you my melody
Late nights, feeling sick, you my remedy
I remember every moment, every memory
Sippin' on you, fuck sippin' on the Hennessy
Have you livin' in the hills out in Beverly
Yeah, we coulda been forever, been a legacy
But you tryna fight, claimin' that we enemies
Thinking 'bout the jealousy, forgettin' all the chemistry, yeah

[Verse]
Whatever happened to ""Together 'til we seventy""?
We moved apart, girl, now we livin' separately
I remember you, can't you remember me?
Loving you, my speciality, you my secret recipe
You helped me find myself, a part of my identity
My love, my oxygen, to me you a necessity
I hope this reaches you, if not, it's my serenity
Bars on my mind like I'm convicted for a felony
And ahh, that was a hard time
It's been a while since we talked, it's been a long time
I've been on my phone, checkin' if you online
Stalkin' up your page, wonder if you're on mine
Been a couple years, thought that I'd be over you
Still hold the tears when I think of holding you
You left and disappeared, I can't get a hold of you
I can't believe you'd do me wrong, was someone else controlling you?
'Cause after all the times, everything we been through
Every time you lie, I'd always defend you
And when I saw you cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple
So tell me, did you love me or did you pretend to?
Everytime you touched me, was it even special?
Was I a priority or squeezed into the schedule?
Baby, you an angel, same time you the devil
After all the times, everything we been through
Every time you lie, I'd always defend you
And every time you'd cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple

And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt

There are just too many
Times that people
Have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you
And I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I’ve
Held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind
Afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you’ve said about me when I’m not around
You think having the upper hand
Means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I’ve had too many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

Watch it drop)

Missed your shot)
Making your heart stop

So many people like me
Put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think
To just say what we feel inside
So many people like me
Walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want
Is to feel like I’m not stepped on
There are so many things you say
That make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall
And I’m counting down the time

It’s about as much as I can stand
So I’m waiting until the upper hand is mine

When I woke up this morning and the haters were up on me
I just told 'em stay up outta my way
Because I got a real bad temper, it's the middle of September
I don't think you wanna catch my case
Man, if you do so much as touch me, then it's bound to get ugly
Where police gon' end up all in my face

How could I know what it's like?
(How could I know what it's like?)
How could I know other life?
Know a lotta artists who don't like to bring it to light
And I'm included in that, I ain't sayin' it's right
But it's been pushed out the news
Don't look like change will happen soon
Donald Trump is all that they talk about, I'm tired of it too
They only talkin' 'bout racism when a city's burning up
When cops are gettin' shot, and when the shooters gettin' caught
Peaceful protest rarely get a mention, y'all demented
This could be prevented
Y'all sensationalize the violence just to get a check in
What's the message?
Only gettin' heard when you draw the weapon
You wonder why these people gettin' hurt
You ain't learned your lesson
Interview yourselves, goddamn it, that might answer questions
Look at how you rep it, what's projected, fuck you Fox News!
Y'all won't ever get it, so I gotta step in

Word to RoZe, I'll never relate to that
Might get pulled over, they check my ID and hit the gas
All these divisions, race, religion, economic class
How are we free till realities can overlap?
I've known what it's like to live 'round dollars on dollars
And I know what's it like to see that money get smaller
And I know what it's like to live with and without God
But I'll never know life at systematical odds
Fucked how the system has played with all of our minds
Wish that we could see each other through a child's eyes
No prejudice instilled, manipulation of the wheel
One world, under one sun
Over one race that is human
We fight amongst ourselves, like, what the hell are we doing?

And if you want a little bang in your ying yang come along

Well we flew through Cincinnati
And we all got really happy
Grabbed a bowl of that Skyline Chili along the way
Then we rolled on into Canton
Scared the hell out of Marilyn Manson
And the party started happenin
Hey hey hey

Then in the middle of a Charleston night
We ran into Jesco White
And a little moonshine got us right plum smacked insane

[Chorus]

Well we broke down in Greenville
In the middle of a hayfield
But a Bud Light truck pulled up and helped us out

So we then headed up to Philly
Partied down like real hillbillies
Brought the Music Mafia
And rocked it out

And Chippewa's where we go
When we're up in Buffalo
Don't you know those yankees drink enough to DROWN

[Chorus]

Listen up
Now LA's got the freaks
At Pink's and 15 dollar drinks
And San Antonio was a wild wild rodeo

And then Phoenix, Arizona
We drank way too much Corona
And we woke up by the river
In Jeff City, MO

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah
We're comin to your city
We're gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song
We'll all be flyin higher than a jet air liner
And if you want a little bang in your ying yang
If you wanna little zing in your zang zang
If you wanna little ting in your tang tang
Come along, come along, come along, come along

And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

[Verso 1]
Tu eres la tristeza de mis ojos
Que lloran en silencio por tu amor
Me miro en el espejo y veo en mi rostro
El tiempo que he sufrido por tu adiós

Obligo a que te olvide el pensamiento
Pues siempre estoy pensando en el ayer
Prefiero estar dormida que despierta
De tanto que me duele que no estés

[Coro]
Como quisiera, ay
Que tú vivieras
Que tus ojitos jamás se hubieran cerrado nunca
Y estar mirándolos

Amor eterno
E inolvidable
Tarde o temprano estaré contigo para seguir...
Amándonos

[Verso 2]
Yo he sufrido tanto por tu ausencia
Que desde ese día hasta hoy no soy feliz
Y aunque tengo tranquila mi conciencia
Sé que pude haber yo hecho mas por ti

Obscura soledad estoy viviendo
La misma soledad de tu sepulcro
Tú eres el amor del cual yo tengo
El más triste recuerdo de Acapulco

[Coro]
Como quisiera, ay
Que tú vivieras
Que tus ojitos jamas se hubieran cerrado nunca
Y estar mirándolos

Amor eterno
E inolvidable
Tarde o temprano estaré contigo para seguir...
Amándonos

You're drifting over the line, line, yeah
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me, can you read the signs?

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And dreaming of the other side
Save your tears and laughter
Because it doesn't matter what you find

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you need it
Here's the place to feed it
But it ain't pretty

When everything that you do is wrong
And you feel like you can barely survive, yeah
When those around you are crumbling downwards
Buried in the sunset alive

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And screaming like you're back from hell
Save your dreams and occupations
'Cause it doesn't matter what you sell

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you want it
Here's the place to get it
But it ain't pretty

The party's over and you're moving on
The party's over and the road is long

If you think you want it
Then just come out and say it

Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me, can you read the signs?

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty

Save your tears and laughter
Because this is the ride
And this is the show

Yes, Sir... let's do it
Yes, Sir... hot... yo

On and on and, my nuts I'm palmin'
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and
Fly, I'm like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream, ""Cheers!""
Get your two-step 'cause this the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, two for a pair
Officially announcing, ""This is warfare,"" 'cause
Back in the day, my clouds was grey
And it seemed liked my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin-ass jets, but now
Man, my vision so clear out the window of the Lear
And I'm talkin' on my celly all the shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now
Hello? Can you hear me now?

On and on and, this beat is on and
I control their mind from straight over the phone
And let 'em explore the words, something like a tourist
And never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious (Yes, Sir)
From Louisville to Jimmy Choos, he's real
She know the time, she sees the Richard Mille
Plat-double skeletal, Tourbillion
It's just like her body, move, it turns her on
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See, I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool it like New Edition unless you hot as you say
I get it, okay, let it boil away
But please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong
And I got something right for them right after this song

On and on and, the temperature is warm and
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nauseous
Bright as a bitch, so analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice, bet a hundred that you vomit
And should I mention the fact the Transition is the track?
No incision to the vision just to get me where I’m at, huh
Little Skateboard, he too grown (Come on)
Ridin' up and down Collins in that that new Two-Tone
It's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh)
I don't smoke but I bet the sense a mil' of it
Totally intensifies the vivid-ass appeal of it
You can be jealous, and grit your teeth (Uh huh)
But all these little niggas got somethin' in reach
So, you want heat? These niggas can front heat

Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz

Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin

So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms

That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country (Uh-huh)
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)
Oh, you know I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

108,Skin (Sarabeth),"Sarah Beth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And the bruise, it just won't go away

So she sits and she waits, with her mother and dad
And flips through an old magazine
Till a nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
And says, 'Will you please come with me?'

Sarah Beth is scared to death
'Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you

Six chances in ten, it won't come back again
With the therapy we're gonna try
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
I think we caught it in time

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

Sarah Beth is scared to death
As she sits, holding her mom
Says it would be a mistake
For someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom

For just this morning, right there on her pillow
Was the cruelest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

It's quarter to seven, that boy is at the door
Her Daddy ushers him in
When he takes off his cap, they all start to cry
'Cause this morning where his hair had been
Softly, she touches just skin

They go dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first, true love is holding her close
And for a moment, she isn't scared",Rascal Flatts,2005,"[98, 81, 68, 53, 50, 44, 46, 42, 46, 58, 65, 75, 79, 86]",14

110,Something To Be Proud Of,"[Verse 1]
There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening
In a conversation, 'bout the way things used to be
I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
Hanging onto every word
Man, the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war
Yea your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

[Verse 2]
Son graduating college, that was momma's dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen
Cause when you got a fast car, and think you got everything
I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage
I fell in love next thing I know
Babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said let me tell you right now

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
No need to make a million just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of

[Pre-Chorus]
And if all you ever really do is the best you can...
Well, you did it man

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of

Baby, envíame tu location
Pero que sea con discretion
Que tu novio no se me entere
Que tú estabas hablando conmigo
Porque si fantasmea se muere

Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chingas conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
Que no te esté llamando (no), dile que lo estoy buscando
Si lo pillo por ahí le mando (brrrr)

[Verso 1: Bryant Myers]

Siempre volvemo' a verno'
Tú pegándole cuerno'
Chingábamos to'a las veces que te dejaba sola
En las noches de invierno
Me cura cuando me enfermo
Pero tenemos que esconderno'
Yo quiero que tú me bailes como bailan
To'as las putas en el infierno, ah
Entro a la cabaña
Tú quieres champaña
Terminamos de hacerlo y me pide chingar
Otra vez cada vez que se baña
Una santa con él y conmigo se daña
Yo sé que to'as las cadenas él las baña
Dile a ese cabrón que tumbe la actitud
Y que deje las miradas extrañas

Siempre estoy online en WhatsApp
Esperando que un culo me escriba
Ella tiene un canal de YouTube
Modelando las nalgas pa' que me suscriba
Echamos tres polvos como las tres líneas de la combi Adidas
No quiere amarrarse (no)
Pero chicha conmigo y mañana se olvida, baby (wuh)
Tu marido anda a pie
Por eso me llama y me pide una ride
Enrola que tengo una moña más verde
Que Linterna Verde y botellas de Sprite
A tu jevo le pongo un checkmark en la cara
Con la 23 le hago el signo de Nike
Tengo a las putas de ustedes
Metidas en Instagram dándome like
Pónme el condón con la boca
Es má', no me lo pongas ya (no quiero)
Me dice que no me da el culo
Si no es en hoteles o en el Gran Meliá (cabrona)
Tengo muchas prepago'
Tengo chapiadoras que maman por trago
Y yo que les compro botellas
Imagínate, mi herma, to' lo que les hago (Almighty)

Que esta noche ella está dispuesta a pegarle cuernos al marío'
Y me digo en la cara del bobo 'e tu esposo
Si yo me lo encuentro
""Lo bueno de estar con mujeres casadas
Es que yo me les vengo adentro""
Me he chingado a modelos cabronas, pero sigo discreto
No me gusta decir quiénes son
Pero dando candela, saben, no es secreto
Con muchas mujeres hermosas siempre me han vinculado

Me he tirado a cinco Miss Universe porque estoy en la mía
Y hasta he puesto a mujeres famosas
A chuparse, lamberse y hasta a hacer orgías
Me le vengo en la boca, se pasa mi leche
Y me mira con cara 'e bellaca
La mando a Colombia, se hace las tetas
Yo soy el que leche le saca
No me importa si está mordío'

Si él quiere problemas andamos bien aborrecíos'

Fumando puré tú me mamas el bicho
Y te exploto la boca a la vez (a la vez)
Mi pistola es fulete y mis peines son todos de dos dedos

Chíngame como si yo voy a morirme mañana, diablita, otra vez

Body like, ""Woah"", made my heart want stop
Is what they say 'cause you look so hot
And I picked you, girl, 'cause of what you got

Have to come near and take it all off
Two glass of wine and off comes the watch
When I get you home it's a whine and cotch
Dress cool, cool, but your hot like coals
I'm tryna bubble and vibe real low

Pretty face, eyes, and smile to match
Didn't wanna rush or go too fast

Didn't wanna come on strong
Or be the fool
So I sat back and just kicked it
Steady flow conversation for a couple minutes
I smiled, she laughed
Minutes turn to hours as they rolled past

She took my heart and gave it life for a night
Didn't know it then but the timing was right
The clock struck 12 and she left in the night, yeah

Got a message Mrs. M saying we should meet again

Let me tell you somethin', baby girl, you frontin'
A girl who talks about it but you never really done it
You're lost in the moment from the moment that you spun it
A spiders web for the men to just come and get stuck in
We are just friends and friends just stay friendly
A flirtatious mind but, girl, don't tempt me
Uh, 'cause I'm a man at the end of the day
So let's just keep it cool 'cause rules I like to break
I ain't breaking any if you keeping it calm
Last chance for you to dance and get up in my arms
Our arms are linked but not tied at the heart
It's hard 'cause your heart just wants to be charmed
Charms are dark parts until they get a spark and
Girl, you’re in the dark but, please, don’t be daft
I just need the dance that I wanted from the start
And I really want to start to get to know you from this mark

My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Sqwad and gangsta
Been bangin' the underground since ninety-five, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence, you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out

I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see, they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me, but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it being my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fucks with us

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love

You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one

She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doing
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after

[Chorus]
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

[Verse 2]
She can't keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on 100 proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me
The more I adore her
What can I do?
I'd do anything for her

[Chorus]
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

[Bridge]
And when she sees it's me
On her caller ID
She won't pick up the phone
She'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
'Cause every word she's ever said
Is still ringing in my head
Still ringing in my head
She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doing
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

[Chorus]
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
Oh, I keep coming back for more

Ay payita mia, guardate la poesia
Guardate la alegria pa'ti

[Estrofa 1: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos
Y hablando de ella
Ay amor me duele tanto (Me duele tanto)
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay amor fue una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adios

[Estrofa 2: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas
Ay amor me duele tanto, me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay, amor, es una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adios

[Estrofa 3: Alejandro Sanz]
No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye negrita mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mi que es mejor
Oye mi negra no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera sin ti no tengo paz
Yo solo soy un hombre muy arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido

Yo se que no he sido un santo
Es que no estoy hecho de carton
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I'm just brutal. It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it

[Chorus: Roxette]
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah

I'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We've built a love but that love falls apart

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash on 'em, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous

Baby, I want you, now-now

Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys

Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite

127,Probably Wouldn't Be This Way,"[Verse 1]
Got a date a week from Friday
With the preacher's son
Everybody says he's crazy
I'll have to see
I finally moved to Jackson
When the summer came
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
I'm probably going on and on
It seems I'm doing more of that these days

[Chorus]
I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky
To have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way

[Verse 2]
Mama says that I just shouldn't speak to you
Susan says that I should just move on
You oughta see the way these people look at me
When they see me 'round here talking to this stone
Everybody thinks I've lost my mind
But I just take it day by day

[Chorus]
I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky
To have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way
Probably wouldn't be this way

Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you

[Intro - over Sample]
Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this

[Verse 1]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in ""New Jack,"" I holla ""Cancel that bitch!""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 3]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty ""BS"" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, ""Look at Niggaraci"" - hello

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life

Hes hurting bad, but hes feeling great

But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar

140,Somebody's Hero,"She's never pulled anybody from a burning building
She's never rocked Central Park
To a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game

She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon
Ride around the world
No, she's just your everyday average girl
(But)

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs

The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

She didn't get a check
Every week like a nine-to-fiver
But she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition

But now her baby's moving on
And she'll soon be missing her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest

It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughter's staring at
All the photographs of her mother
And she wishes she could be like that
Oh but she already is

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home

She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero",Jamie O’Neal,2005,"[89, 78, 60, 59, 54, 51, 53, 59, 61, 72, 78, 82, 85, 92, 90, 90, 99]",17

They've finally come true

City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

[Duet: Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone]
A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling

And ""you'll be alright""

Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart

Hear the dogs howling out of key

Hear the drum pounding out of time

Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

Uh, now, they lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease

Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus

Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion, let's get it

Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though

Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm a original see but they trace like stencil
A stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
'Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine

On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit

Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
(Niggas feelings) And still chillin on Simpson in Center Hillin'
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

[Verse Two: Lil Scrappy]
I'm the prince shorty don't get it twisted
Been callin shots since before my flows existed
And still find birds in my momma kitchen
You might see me burnin purple in the subdivision
I got soldiers on deck, babyface pimpin
Whatchu' know 'bout dat, I get a bad Brenda
With that vert' top back, my jeans feelin tight
Cause my pockets stay fat, playa better know that
My neck got so much shit, danglin
Big dick, big chain, we just keep on hangin
Got a Hollywood ho, and a broad that be sangin
They be hatin cause I'm famous {?} what I was thankin
And this for every don nigga thankin he passed me
Y'all just thank that you gone and the shit'll be nasty
I'mma stay ballin, ballin off my old school classic
Lil Scrap got big bank, now see if you can match it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: P$C]
Shorty I'm down with the kings, so call me the greatest
Number one hustler, I keep the street blazin
If the grapes don't sell, I dry 'em up and sell raisins
While y'all cherry pickin hustlers out here slavin
That king shit nigga runs deep in my veins
Pump through my heart, live in my bone marrow mayne
That's pimpin! My gas is premium like octane
Cain't tell me nuttin 'bout stackin these Benja-maynes
I'm the king of the Dirty, see me seated in the throne
Overruled other dudes like Caesar did in Rome
With a prince that's so demandin and an aura so strong
The South ain't been represented like this in so long
I'm an emperor, you best be glad I'm workin on my temper
Otherwise I'd cock a pistol, send some missiles to your temple
Disrespect us I'mma blick 'em 'til I get you plain and simple
Brass knuckles to your dentals blast suckers in they dimples

[Verso 1]
O-O-O-Oh shit, no sé si te mentí
Pero si lo pienso voy a decir que sí
Cada vez que me fui
Si fue por mi forma de alejarme de todo lo que vi
Hace frío en abril, ponele fin (en abril)
Que ya no me agrada a últimamente fingir
Campera de cuero, camino por la street
Como si supiese de qué trata vivir
Porque sé que es morir mientras viví'
Y no quiero nunca más estar así
Dale, come with me; son seventeen
De esa mierda mala mucho más aprendí
¿Cómo-Cómo decís? ¿cómo decís?
No vale la pena pelear por esta shit

161,All Jacked Up,"[Verse 1:]
Five of the PM rolls around
There's a little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ears

The next you know
The bartenders pouring
Shots are flowing
Got me stoning
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment

[Chorus:]
I'm all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies
When you're all jacked up

[Verse 2:]
It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
What the hell
I have one more shot

Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far
Cause a big 'ol girl walked outta the blue

Ten foot, two
With a bad attitude
Stepped right up
And knocked out my tooth
Guess I had it coming I deserved the due

[Chorus:]
Cause I was all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up

[Bridge:]
Don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
That's what they said when I got my last beer

[Verse 3:]
Oh my God, it's 2:00
I can't find my keys and my trucks locked
So I grabbed a tire tool
And I broke my window

Hurt my elbow
Got me in though
Two foot later
Backed into the light pole
All the town folk got a good show

[Chorus:]
All jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your truck
When you're all jacked up

Jacked up
(All jacked up, all jacked up)
Ooh, oooh, oooooh

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your car
Don't start no stuff in no bar
Hell
I wouldn't even tell anybody where you are
When you're all jacked up

All jacked up

All jacked up

162,Must Be Nice,"[Verse 1]
Wishin' I could say goodbye to being broke, and say hello to bread
But I'm broke and my grass looks yellow and dead
But the jello is red, and it's green in my bag
So i'll chill out and roll a cigarillo instead
I been waitin' for a minute
Feelin' as though I been comin' with it ever since the television was invented
I been looking thru the glass I just wanna get up in it
Seein' rappers on and they don't even know the business, like...
Like I'm knowin' that I'm better than you
Seein what these rappers gettin' to do
Going crazy
I ain't got much weed left, but my brethren do
Need some tree, need some whiskey an excedrin too
Man I'm stressed out... but it's looking up and thats a start
Might not be on the radio but this is art
I just wanna get by that's the biggest part
I'm in my 20s still feeling like a kid at heart
Lost in this young world, I'm just tryna navigate
See the pie sliced I'm just tryna grab a plate
We see commercials we infatuate
Wishing I was born rich with a fat estate

Must be nice
To wake up to a beautiful view
Must be nice
To be a one-per-center in the chosen few
Must be nice
To live a life of luxury
Must be nice
Must be nice

[Verse 2]
And when we fast forward to the good life's a hell of a trip
Except now-a-days its like my whole perspective is flipped
Used to wish that I would have shows
Now I tour 6 months out the year and its nothin now to bag ho's
Blowin kush when I wake up yeah the scent is strong
Then I'm pulling these balenciaga denims on
One leg at a time just like you
Except I'm making gold records from a nice view
Tryna stay humble while I get cashed out
Racks on racks, credit cards never maxed out
Making more then my parents did
That ain't saying much, but its still a mind fuck, yeah
Eating out, reading menus slow
Back then my wallet would decide what I chose
Now its white table cloths wearing nice clothes
Flying out for shows and my whole team goes

All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine
But I'mma start it at home
When I see a girl I like
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Hey girl how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange (heyy)
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got, people to meet and many places to see (heyy)
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
Cause I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffc jam booty heads pausin' so fast (heyy)
I would'nt trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors cordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV
Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the Autobahn, swervin drivin
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me (heyy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardi Gras all the women tryna show me they chest (heyy)
I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mashatuck
I had, sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan (heyy)
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh)
Oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil

The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real

Pimpin' pimpin' pimpin'
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Could we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Now ladies look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga ""put your hands down""
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please ""put your hands down""
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say ""put your hands down""
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin
If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass

Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from

She said, ""I've seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Bridge]
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff

[Intro - Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

La, la, la la

Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?

You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, ""Back in my day""
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Verse 2]
Oh, I forgot the things I knew
It was I who'd abandoned you
Forgive me, I was lost in doubt
You had never left my side
Picked me up when I thought I might die
You held me and I was found

I'll keep my hair fixed, keep rockin' the hottest outfits

On a blanket lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain

Cotton fields remember when
Flash 'a lightnin' drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was poundin' more
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in, the storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
All the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing
Except for the Georgia rain

Screen door flappin' in the wind
Same ol' house I grew up in
Can't believe I'm back again
After all these years away
You fixed your Daddy's house up nice
I saw it yesterday when I drove by
Looks like you've made youself a real good life
What else can I say

On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away

178,Wake Up,"[Verse 1]
'Cause we've been driving so long
I can't remember how we got here
Or how we survived so long
Out trying to run from our pride
'Till you set fire to my atmosphere
And I remember how I spent the twenty-third
Feeling six feet under
When I'm thirty-thousand feet in the air
Chasing that sundown
So far east I'm westbound
Feeling like the edge of this world is near

[Pre-Chorus]
But you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to god I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
This is more than just a phase, love
Shooting stars all break up
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things will be better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

[Chorus]
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million, anyway?

[Verse 2]
'Cause you see only what you want to
Your tunnel vision owns you
And you can't see what's wrong
When you keep sleeping through the PM
Eyes wide open when you're dreaming
You’re sleepwalking, just keep talking
Maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
No B-plan in your system
Just tell me what you're thinking
I'm scared that you might fall
But you're not
But you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Taking off your makeup
Sun always seems to wash our fears away
And it's always shining somewhere
I just gotta get there
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things are better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

[Chorus]
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million?

[Bridge]
You’re so much better than that
You’re so much better than that
You’re so much better than that
Stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million anyway?

[Outro]
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to God, I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say:

179,Best Of You,"[Intro]
I've got another confession to make, I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?

[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 1]
Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have, but had no use
I was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again, but I break loose
My head is giving me life or death, but I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Bridge]
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess

[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 2]
I've got another confession, my friend, I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best

180,Something More,"So I saw you while I was walking past the coffee shop
Had to stop and look I mean you haven't been around a lot
And I guess that I was caught up when you waved me inside
And I'll tell you what was going on inside of my mind
I was like ""trust me, love me, hold me, or say
That you'll cherish and embarrass me and miss me everyday""
But I had to reevaluate my plate, I was thinking all ahead
I had to ask you on a date, I was home base
But screw the references and let me swing a pitch too
Swear that there ain't no other guys that can compare to this dude
I got notes up on my phone filled with millions of sentences
To copy, paste, and post when you're not feeling what you're dealing with
Trust me, ain't nobody ready like me
You say you keep up all ya guards but to me it's a squeeze
And I'll slip through all the cracks, hope it's comfy in ya feelings fort
And it may be make believe but maybe

[paper latte &Love-sadKiD]
We could be something more

[paper latte]
Something more than smiles out the door
Something more than shy finger tips on eyelids
Darling I can't find this anywhere else
You open through
The color of your eyes, as if you knew
There's so much more than this
So did you read the Greeks yesterday
Because there's an ancient spark in you and I can't look away
God
Do you feel grace, or do you walk with such love
That I don't know how you carry it all by yourself
It's incredible, what you do, I just need to talk to you

[Verse 3- Tony Yayo]
I put the g in g-unit
Baby I got game

And I dunno your name
Is it the wheels on the hot car
Meals from the shot bar
Or you just wanna quickie with a rap star
Ladies tell the truth, you know I'm cute
But what really turns you on is the rims on my coupe
Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
Going to the tele and your getting popped off
I can't stop thinking of the things you do
When you freaking me and I'm freaking you
I said the ice on my neck make the shorties stick

Stop, slow down baby

It's the People's Champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppa Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Hoes that diss me in the club, the same hoes in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T. Farris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm with that Gu U on 5-9-double-O
In the Tahoe on 24's I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Coota Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say ""cheese"" and show my fronts, it's more karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm...

What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gangbangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Tryna find some Honey Love, my macking game is top rank
These hoes peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, tryna figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm

Everyday I need an ounce and a half, S.P
The only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes, I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

I'mma smoke till my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)

188,How To Deal,"1st Verse:
Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesnt wanna do
Do i live my life with you as my wife?
Or do i go on and pursue my lifetime dream?
I gotta do this for me
Cuz if I dont I'll probably regret it
But if I do I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

CHORUS:
How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And theres nothin you can do about it
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it though its heart-breakin'
Its somethin that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live..
How do I deal without you

2nd Verse:
Its killing me to know
That your heart's with me
But you're with him cuz I chose to be
In this industry
Money, shows and hoes come along with
Luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it
But this is the life
That I was given
So i have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime
Without you

[Chorus]
SOLO:
How do you deal when
You can't be with the one you love
And the one that you love is with somebody else
(I don't know, I don't know)
And what do you do
When you know she don't love him
And she loves me but she just can't stand loving you far away
(I guess I'm gonna have to just)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want to have to live with it)

190,Diamonds From Sierra Leone,"[Produced by Kanye West, Devo Springsteen and Jon Brion]

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)

Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night
Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

[Chorus]
I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

[Verse 2: AJ]
All the doors are closing I'm trying to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me

I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that

Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me

When we love

I'm gonna be here for you baby, I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard

I want to sleep with you forever, I want to die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

I'm gonna love you, like nobody loves you
I'll win your trust making memories of us
I want to honor your mother, I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw

I want to stand out in a crowd to you, a man among men
I want to make your world better than it's ever been

I want to love you, like nobody loves you
I'll win your trust making memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow, wherever before winds blow
There'lll be a new day coming your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on, this you'll know somehow
You've been stretched to the limit, but it's all right now

I'm gonna make you a promise, if there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm wet kiss

I'm gonna love you, like nobody loves you
I'll win your trust making memories of us

I'm gonna love you, like nobody loves you

I breathe in slow to compose myself
But the bleeding heart I left on the shelf
Started speeding 'round, beating half to death

So I press my lips down into your neck
And I stay there and I reconnect
Bravery I've been trying to perfect
It can wait for a while

Scared of the hope in my head
It's been making me sweat, but it turns out
You're here with your head on my chest

The world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete

[Verse 2]
I breathe out now and we fall back in
Just like before we can re-begin
Let your lungs push slow up against my skin
Let it all feel just fine

Gone is the emptiness
We just take what's best and we move on
All of the hurt gets left

212,Untitled (How Can This Happen To Me?),"Q : You wanted good performance from the side and you got one. You must be happy?

PDC : You are very generous. No, in terms of discipline, desire, commitment, nothing to say. I really think you know that they gave everything

I told them, obviously, Bale once again - unfortunately - made the difference but you can appreciate the goal he scored. It’s obvious that they [Tottenham] should score even before

They deserved to stay 1-0 up early but in terms of commitment, desire to only say thanks to the players but that should be normal. It’s obvious my frustration is because, we didn’t cause more problem to the opponent but in general today, yes. I'm happy

Very happy. Because, after what’s happened during the week, it wasn’t easy. Coming here with 11 adults, six, seven adults, some young on the field starting eleven and six kids on the bench wasn’t easy. Until the end we were nearly able to pick a point. That is one of the only good things that happened today


Q : Can you give us your thoughts on the pictures of Phil Bardsley?

PDC : You know more than me. I discover... I saw the picture on a website, the moment later, of the night that they spent out so what do I have to tell you?

He’s out of my squad. It’s obvious. How I can play a player that probably is blurry for three, four days after what’s happened? More importantly I want to deliver a very clear message that I have wanted to deliver since the beginning - that there is no excuse to behave like he did, because Wigan lost the game

Now we stay up, otherwise every time we are going to beat Man United what are we going to do? Or after every Newcastle game?

What are we going to do, spend two nights out because we are happy? I can understand if we win a Champions League or maybe an FA Cup. Even can have two glass of red wine I can understand because I know it is a different culture

It can happen also to me. Celebrate a Uefa Cup with Juventus, more in the night, more drink but I can imagine because I don’t want to change the culture of the people

But I told them, from the day before: 'From now I will be more strict because I will judge you more carefully because *now* we have to improve our professionalism. We have to respect the dignity of the club, the fans because they still follow us [3,000 people at Spurs] and the rules of the sport because, like we were happy when Swansea won against Wigan, we have to make sure we give everything to make difficult for Tottenham

For Arsenal, obviously for ourselves, but also for the others. The most important thing is for us but also for the sport in general. [The players] have to care what is going on around us. But, if you don’t respect yourself, how can you respect the others?

Q: Does it affect his [Bardsley's] future?

PDC : I will think really carefully. Always I give a second chance to the people. We are talking about 31 years of age, not a kid, with a family at home. I’m not here to be a priest, to convince the people to be different but to talk about my club and my team. We have a fantastic academy. We have young players that they have the changing room next to the adult

If we don't punish this kind of behaviour, what are we talking about, a fantastic academy? They are going to sprint down, get the boots and ""good morning"" to everybody? They're very educated people, but if we don't punish this kind of behaviour, how do they grow up? Thinking they can laugh about what they saw on the website picture? Maybe they think it's fantastic, to be like a gangster. But what mentality are we going to deliver?

Sometimes I discovered here at Sunderland - and at many other places, unfortunately - there is always a fantastic Christmas box. Then inside...oh, nothing. There is a piece of chocolate that's open already. We have to put something in this box, otherwise we're always talking and we close our eyes and we're never going to change. In the future I will be very clear with the players

It's not an English culture, just a different culture. I don't want to change the culture because I love England. When you decide to work in an environment there is positive and negative. I know this part. I was speaking with Andre [Villas Boas] before and it's normal, but not often and not at the wrong time. There is time and time

Tonight I can imagine [the players will go out because we won], even after the Newcastle game [ which we won], I can imagine. But not like we saw [on Tuesday night]. That is something really wrong

It's disgusting me even to see the image for the club. It's not about going out with your friend and getting back at two o'clock or three o'clock, which is late. But you can close one eye. But not full of alcohol and walking like this. They have to behave well

It takes three or four days [to recover]. I realised in the morning because I didn't see the picture, to be honest, I told my assistant manager: 'I don't play Phil Sunday or today.'

Q : Why?

PDC : Look. I speak to him and he look in the sky. He can't listen what I'm going to tell him. He's blurry: 'I don't know what's happened.'

The day after I discovered what had happened and, obviously, I ring my player and I discovered it was a really, really bad situation. I discovered that out with him were other players, but the others left the two guys before, to get into the casino and stay there until early in the morning, which is completely different

Obviously, Tuesday night they went out together, had dinner and watched the game. They are allowed to do this. They had a drink, celebrated and they were happy. I can imagine. Ten o'clock, 11 o'clock, MIDNIGHT...but not exaggerate. What I saw is not acceptable for my club and for my squad. That is not acceptable

Talking about mentality it's not only the manager. All my staff, we have to make sure that when we bring in players they are good professionals because they have to influence each other. The dressing room is their kingdom. I can't put the strict rules to help them to understand we have to behave in a different way. We need to bring in six or seven players who know how to behave ad have a professional ethic and then they can help each other. Otherwise, for me, it's difficult

We are talking about profession or the job we want to deliver or rules. I go mad because, I’m telling you this. What happened to Bardsley is a … pass for what’s happened the last three days. In a week I give in 7 players hands, 7 fines. Even then four players are half an hour late...

Q : [Interruption] Will there be another fine for the sending off?

PDC : It’s clear it was a silly, silly, challenge. You have to be punished in some way because in here [points to his head] there was the mentality that he already got punished.He got the three match ban. Of course he says sorry but we live in life

I drive [too] fast two months ago. I say sorry but I get fine. Probably they are going to give me 6 points. I was wrong. There is a picture but maybe that wasn’t Paolo Di Canio. Maybe I should send other maybe information!

Paolo DI Canio was guilty and I have to pay the price otherwise I’m never going to have self-discipline. So we have to help the people to understands to take their responsibility

This week, 7 fines. And this morning, THIS MORNING, once again - even if they didn’t care about what is happening at the Academy of LighT - one player who could not be involved in my squad for different reasons today, they decide ‘I don’t train today’

They make the diagnosis themselves. One player didn’t go to the academy of light because he said ‘yesterday I had a food poisoning.’ Sorry ‘are you the doctor?’

The doctor tried to contact him and three hours he switched off the telephone. This is the situation at Sunderland. This is why I tell you we made a miracle. We made a miracle

Previously, eight games, three points. With Di Canio seven games, eight points. That is the miracle we made. Without the strikers. Because before there was Fletcher available. Stephane available. Craig available. 3 top strikers

That is the miracle we made. But we can’t make a miracle forever so we have to change lots of things. Or maybe I’m going to tell you this and tonight they are going to sack me

But of you want to change something you have to follow me otherwise it’s difficult to get better results than what they got in the last few games


Q : Are you going to speak to the owner? Do you have his support?

PDC : He knows. I will get the chance when I meet him. We are going to sit at the table and go through but he knows many things

I spoke to him before by telephone and he told me we are going to change many things. This is what he told me before

Relax, don’t worry because we are going to change many things. So it sounds like he supports me completely. We will see in the future

Have you fined the players for similar offences to Phil Bardsley

No. Different reasons. They haven’t broken my rules but the rules you have in e very club. Because if you are injured and no that you have plans in the morning and have treatment in the afternoon you have to go in the pool

And [yet you] you leave [at] lunchtime and switch off the telephone and nobody can contact you for all day then you have to get fined

This is not Paolo Di Canio. When I gave the fine in his hand the day after he was surprised. He thought it was normal to leave the training ground, switch off the phone and I don’t go through the job I have to do

I don’t care to have argument with my players but they have to go through the rules. This is one and the others. If you think after Aston Villa we lost 6-1. We gave the (meeting) point as four o'clock in the afternoon

Someone arrived at 4.20. I didn’t get the appointment to them. If I did I can understand and you don’t sleep. But at 4.20 and you don’t arrive, what sense of responsibility have they got? They live 5 minutes from the academy of light

Three, four players arrived by [motions as if strolling in leisurely]. If you are late I can imagine you are late, you are running, ‘ I’m sorry.’ This was the behaviour at a club in the Premier League. That spends millions and millions

Its not acceptable. I thought it was only at Swindon, League Two, that they were arrogant, ignorant ­footballers because they’ve not had many chances to stay at the top level

I have to tell you ­unfortunately I found a worse environment in terms of discipline in this club. This Is what I’ve found in the last few weeks so we have to change completely

It will be hard if I don’t receive the maximum support from the board because I know every time you know that the player will go to the PFA, the PFA will call then you have to let them speak and try to explain why

They excuse people that behave like Phil Bardsley. You can’t fine them but have to let them speak and explain why?

Why do they need to speak? They get fined. They are under a private club. The PFA don’t pay them, it’s a private club that pays them

They have to now try and understand because for our player we already received a phone call. It was a clear misconduct. But the club pay them, not you. Now we have to be more sensible but it’s very difficult to change

Q : Will those players be at Sunderland next year if you can control that decision?

PDC : (Pauses) No. Not under me

Q : Do you have financial backing from the owner?

PDC : I know that there is a plan. The picture is clear before me. I have told about it already. I am head coach, the others have to handle the financial situation. I have said we need this player, this quality, in this position, show me the player we can go and I tell them yes this player is ok

Q : What about holidays? Have you cut their holiday time?

PDC : For the players? The next few days we will be in together because previously once again the people you see organised during the week to go from London to Hawaii, Miami

They was thinking 4 or 5 days ago: 'We will organise the bags, my wife, my girlfriend and we go together.'

Not possible. Today we fly back to Sunderland, our city, as a team. *WE* stay tomorrow together with the kit sponsors as we have a job to do with this. Then the players have international football. The others will stay together. We will enjoy it and then they can go on holiday.'",Paolo Di Canio,2005,"[80, 75, 67, 65, 56, 56, 49, 50, 53, 55, 57, 57, 53, 63, 73, 95]",16

Hop in the Track and I burn out the wheels (Skrrt)
I fuck with the gangsters, don't fuck with my peers
Fresh out of Jeffrey's, I hop on the Lear

Flawless the diamonds, I boog out the ear

I fell in love with the game and I married it (Trappin')

Pushin' that bitch through the 'jects like a chariot (Yeah)

217,Nada Es Para Siempre,"[Letra de ""Nada Es Para Siempre""]

[Verso 1]
Sin querer te lastimé
Sin querer te abandoné
Sólo sé que yo no sé
Cuidarte de mi amor

Necesito tu perdón
Necesito verte hoy
Sólo sé que yo no sé
Cuidarte de mi amor

[Pre-Estribillo]
Si al final siempre el tiempo se va
Donde caen los días
Si al final abrazarse al dolor
No nos deja brillar

Dime qué será, qué será de los dos
Cuando pase la vida
Algo ocurrirá, tengo una sensación
Una carta guardada, un buen signo del sol

[Estribillo]
Nada es para siempre, nada es para siempre
No me digas, mi amor
Que te falta valor
Porque nada es para siempre

[Verso 2]
Si pudieramos hablar
Si pudieramos dejarlo
Vos sabés que yo no sé
Cuidarte de mi amor

Otra vez me equivoqué
Otra vez te abandoné
Vos sabés que yo no sé
Cuidarte de mi amor

[Pre-Estribillo]
El azar nos permite cambiar
Nuestro incierto destino
El temor que nos puede vencer
Sin mirar más allá

Yo creo que al final, nunca sé dónde voy
Pero sigo un camino
Algo ocurrirá, tengo la sensación
Una carta marcada, un buen signo del sol

[Estribillo]
Nada es para siempre, nada es para siempre
No me digas, mi amor
Que te falta valor
Porque nada es para siempre

Nada es para siempre, nada es para siempre
Si tu risa escapó
Si no escuchas mi voz
Sabes, nada es para siempre

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)

You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)

Up in the club where they get real naughty

I'd really like to know her
The way she runs her
Body up and down, she got me heated up
I can't front, I really wanna beat it up
Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes
Got that red coupe matchin' the chrome
Put that body in motion, motion
And watch it wave like a ocean, ocean
Now break it down and worm it, worm it
Now bring it up, now shake it, shake it

Still in the hood, one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in the tongue
Compton, R. Kelly found her in the slumps
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me, I have your girl yellin', uhh
Kellz, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to you just how you like it, girl

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Girl, you're on a mission
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
The way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close, handle your business
Now make your booty go (Boom boom boom boom)
Break it down now (Boom boom boom boom boom)
Bring it up now (Boom boom boom boom)
Push it back, girl
(Kellz, you crazy for this one)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out the club, in the coupe to the mansion
We gon' get bent up 'til the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl, bump and grind it
We gon' do it 'til we drop, until the party stop
We gon' keep it hot, oh

Will you chew until it bleeds?

A charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood
Which we dine

Will you chew until it bleeds?

Apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention
Is my one last shot at redemption
'Cause I know to live, you must give your life away

And I’ve been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I’ve been locked inside that house
All the while you hold the key
And I’ve been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though there’s no way of knowing where to go
I promise I’m going because

[Chorus]
I gotta get outta here
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you
I’m begging you to be my escape

[Verse 2]
I'm giving up on doing this alone now
'Cause I've failed and I’m ready to be shown how
You've told me the way and I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence that I'm serving
I admit that I'm every bit deserving
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair

'Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I've been locked inside that house, all the while you hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me

Promise I'm going because

I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you
I'm begging you to be my escape

I am a hostage to my own humanity
Self-detained and forced to live in this mess I've made
And all I'm asking is for you to do what you can with me
But I can't ask you to give what you already gave

224,Trapped In The Closet,"[Verse]
Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretching and yawning
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darling"" from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face like what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here 'til the morning sun?
Must have lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, ""Woman, move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs
""Shh, shh, quiet, hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound, or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the fifth floor""
""Shit, think, shit, think, shit, quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
And he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says ""Honey I'm in the room""
He walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him and says ""I've cooked and ran your bathwater""
I'm telling you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed and starts to snatching her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it, but things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, ""There’s a mystery going on
And I'm going to solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet""
He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch, say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed (bed)
Then under the dresser (dresser)
He looks at the closet (closet)
I pull out my Beretta (Beretta)

Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now we're going round in circles
Tell me, will this deja vu never end? Oh

Now you tell me that you've fallen in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, ay

229,Go!,"[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part

230,Goodbye Time,"[Verse 1]
It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep starin' at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore

[Chorus]
If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

[Verse 2]
If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway

If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind

232,Keg In The Closet,"[Verse 1]
We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

[Verse 2]
This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday

There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm going to settle down
I've got news for you

[Chorus 1]
I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Verse 2]
And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you

[Chorus 1]
Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Chorus 2]
I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose

[Chorus 1]
Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do

[Verse 3]
Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two

I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy

238,My Sister,"[Pre-Chorus]
Have you seen my sister Evelyn?
Dang she's gone and wandered off again
I've been looking high and low
Where oh where'd my sister go?

[Chorus]
She's been known to spend some time
With a sailor friend of mine
I called him up and what'd he say?
""I ain't seen that girl today.""

So if you see my sister Evelyn
Tell that girl to hurry home again
Where oh where'd my sister Evelyn go?

[Verse 1]
Is she with the doctor or the plumber
Or the dentist or the handyman?
Did she go to India or Africa
Or Wichita or Pakistan?
Did she go join the Navy, or go completely crazy
Or is she playing a trick on me?

Did she run off with the barber, the professor
Or the banker, or the clergyman?
Is it possible that she could be in Timbuktu
Or Katmandu or Vegas or Uzbekistan?
She learning how to do-do
The Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Oh golly where could that girl be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you seen my sister Evelyn?
Dang she's gone and wandered off again
I've been looking high and low
Where oh where'd my sister go?

[Chorus]
She's been known to jump a train
With a gal we know from down the lane
I looked her up and wha'd she say?
""I ain't seen that girl in days.""

So if you see my sister Evelyn
Tell that girl to hurry home again
Where oh where'd my sister Evelyn go?

[Verse 2]
Is my floozy sister with the doctor
Or the drummer
Or the dentist or the handyman?
Did that ho-bag quit her job and run off
With that dick-head Mike
To Indio, Guantanamo
Or Panama or Disneyland?

Is she studying Kabbalah?
Did she win a million dollars?
Or is she dead in a ditch somewhere?

[Chorus]
So if you see my sister Evelyn
Tell that girl to hurry home again

A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?

A door behind a door

I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song

I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?

In that video, she sings, ""Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!"" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze"" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, ""freeze""? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word ""pee-pee""
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down!

Thank God they caught it fast

But if something should happen
Stop in sometime and say hello to Katherine
You and Mary Anne could always keep her laughing
She's going to need a lot of that
Take her out to a movie
Its going to take some time before she's back on her feet

But there's always that chance
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

Little Nathan's growing up so fast
This November he'll turn 10
He wants to play quarterback
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall
But I may not get to after all
He's going to need someone to catch a pass
And to throw it back

If something should happen
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out camping
Throw a line out in that water every now and then
Answer any question that he has
Maybe once he gets older
You can sit and have that first cold beer together
And tell him a couple stories on his father
He's always known you were my best friend
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

I hope I live until I'm 80
And I get to see my son get married
And have babies
And make a million more memories with my wife
Yeah buddy I pray alright
But if its my time to leave
Would you watch over them for me?

Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana
Because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated

Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated

French Vanilla's a hell of a flavor for me
With strawberries, two cherries and whipped cream
The best things are the wet dreams
And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene
Orally, I speak the truth
Cuz the blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
Cuz, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches
When they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin'

I came for it
I got a thing for ya
That I can't ignore

She put that sugar on my tongue, tongue
Yippie Yippie, Yum Yum
Goodie goodie gum drop
Put me in a tongue lock
Did it till my body went numb, numb
Laid her on her back, back
Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack
She's a woman from the block with the best of weave
But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my size was just right
Cuz she wanted a man with a little sec-ur-ity
Said I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly
Said she wanted it all night
So put the bubbles in the tub and Luda-christen me

So delicious and so damn edible
All I need is some honey or syrup
With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
Cuz I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

253,The Talkin' Song Repair Blues,"The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, ""This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done, shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all.""

""The torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck""
He said, ""I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks.""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
Then he said, ""Ain't you that songwriter guy?""
I said, ""Yes, I am,"" he said, ""So am I.""

And he sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
And he said, ""What do you think? Now don't hold nothin' back.""

Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look
And I said, ""This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut-rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs have backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak.""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
And I said, ""Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news

But your whole melodic structure's worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you.""

And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over there and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for eig...nine hundred bucks.""

Said I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Verse 2]
He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it

I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu

Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you
When you show me what you working, baby, no problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh-huh)

It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'

All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on

Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for you

[Pre-Chorus]
(I know your sick about) the way I found you out

You should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me

[Bridge]
Girl I tried to give you everything
Can't believe the ways you repaid me
Girl you had it all
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you
Baby I've accepted it
And I ain't gone trip
Girl I'm moving on
Sometimes I can't help but think that another man's gonna get the one I made for me

[Chorus]

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?

How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra??",Mario,2005,"[76, 70, 66, 53, 58, 57, 54, 54, 52, 54, 55, 59, 69, 72, 79, 80, 93]",17

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

Wasn't worth never having you

But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

But it's not my scene

Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down

Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

[Verse 3]
Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long

But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel

Ain't so easy to do

Pero antojao'

Tengo la camisa negra
Hoy mi amor está de luto
Hoy tengo en el alma una pena
Y es por culpa de tu embrujo
Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres
Y eso es lo que más me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y una pena que me duele

Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qué maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo

Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

Y debajo tengo el difunto

I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar and said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a livin'
Country music mixed with a little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry but I've never been crazy
'Bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said

'Cause it's songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean if you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try
Then later on when we finished our songs
About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there right next to the stage
And he shouted, man you were right it was like you sang those

Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God

Every single morning
Wake up in the afternoon
Cover up the mirror
Just to get a better view
Been around the world and never even left the room
And I, I can't figure out
Why? So I just scream and shout

[Chorus: Robbie Williams]
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Everybody's looking at me, but I don't see them
Living for the weekend, caught in the deep end
Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter
Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter
Tryin'a get high off a quarter
I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker
Star, pop bottles, date top models
Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle
Where's the love though?
Nobody cares about that, where's the club? Where's the drugs though? Front row
Follow the flow, Megaupload
Feel the adrenaline rush, who's the mug though? I don't know

[Pre-Chorus 2: Robbie Williams]
I
I can't figure out
Why?

I believe I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Living in a bubble, my life is a puzzle
I'm caught in the rubble, now pass me a shovel
Now pass me a shot, and make it a double
I'm a whole lot of trouble and I don't do subtle
It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle
No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle
I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game
Going insane, 150 in the slow lane
Getting ahead of myself
My God, already thinking how can I better myself
Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself?
My car's a rocket, and if I get too carried away, I wouldn't know when to stop it

[Pre-Chorus 2: Robbie Williams]
I
I can't figure out
Why?

274,Anything But Mine,"[Verse 1]
Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells, ski ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

[Chorus]
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Verse 2]
There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

[Chorus]
But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland

Yo, Frankie J, obsession

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
Well, it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin' 'bout you, baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin' turning in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

[Verse 2: Frankie J]
Now, I know you're not my lady
But I'm just tryna make this right
I don't know what to do, I'm going out of my mind
So baby, if you let me
Kick it witchu, well then maybe
We could ride together, we could do this all night
Now I don't care if you got a man
Baby, I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning

Hold up, let me dream
Shorty got me feelin' serene
Where my candy, where my cream?
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up, wait a minute
Baby, you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got a lot of money, and I love to spend it
And that's what's up and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin'

Imma keep it saucy 'cause my ma know how I do
We go rendezvous
Mi corazon belongs to you

276,That's What I Love About Sunday,"[Verse 1]
Raymond's in his Sunday best, he's usually up to his chest
In oil and grease
There's the Martin's walking in, with that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me

[Chorus 1]
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday

[Verse 2]
I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out

[Chorus 2]
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
And steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

Ooh, new believers getting baptized

Yeah, let's take 'em back

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
'91 I stepped in this game
After 'Whats The 411?' things ain't been the same
And I can't complain but with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here and my music's still sincere
Let's get back to the story all of this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I been through

Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops

And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Then I came with 'Share My World' but at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way, then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that it's just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt but my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them and I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that week, it was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops

And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen

You remind me of a real love (you don't have to worry)

When everything is life and death
You may feel like there's nothing left
Instead of love and trust and laughter

Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, ""Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!""
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned did reppin harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar

281,Karma,"[Verse 1]
I held you down for the longest
And I was there through all of your darkest moments
Feels just like yesterday when we were homeless
Gotchu some bread and start treating me bogus
Talking 'bout you wanted something new (something new)
Like I wasn't good enough for you (good for you)
Guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
Maybe you should take a look in your rear view
'Cause obviously you forgot all the times that I held you when you cried
And don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong I stood by your side?
No I guess not, I guess not, 'cause you let them thots take my spot
Congratulations to you, what you wanted is what you got now (you got now babe)

[Chorus]
So you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (fun now)
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry 'bout me (don't gotta worry, baby)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (you're unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)
Just remember what goes around, comes around

[Verse 2]
I remember when you said that you could have somebody better
And I can't even lie to you it really messed my head up
Had me lookin' in the mirror disgusted with myself
Wishin' that I looked like someone else
Like the girls you liked on Instagram (damn)
And you really had the nerve to call me insecure
Maybe it wasn't you
Maybe it's true I didn't know my worth (didn't know my worth)
Maybe, maybe I should've loved me first (loved me first)
Maybe, maybe I should've loved me first

[Chorus]
So you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry 'bout me (you don't gotta worry, no)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now, yeah)

Cut you up like you ain't been cut

This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eyeing you all day in the mall miss lady
You looking good, I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could
But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious
You delirious, or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like almond joys and kisses

Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Bend you over and I""ll follow you straight to the room
Where it goes down lovely in the Legion of Doom

Shit, you know the deal before a nigga even stepped
Damn that ass hot, seems like it's gone melt
You know I give it to you til you run out of breath
Then bust a nut all over yourself
The first time I called, you were juggling on my balls
In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
From the back then to the side to the front
Turn around,you got me right
I smack them thighs, anyway that you want me
So gone see about a pimp and that monkey
And that's fo' sho'

What's the buiseness baby, can I get in them drawes
I like the way your hands rub against my balls
Cause you the one, a nigga met at south dekalb mall
With your pretty brown skin, thick thighs and all
135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, You a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'mma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill
And I feel, you love to fuck up on a hill
Suck dick from behind, and take nut in your grill
So bitch chill, and shut your mouth just for a second
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy

286,Look What You've Done,"[Produced by Chase N. Cashe and Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we, do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

[Verse 1: The Game]
Fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Chrome hydraulics, 808, drums
You don't want, none, nigga better, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk
Come get, some, pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
It's red-rum, ready, here it come
Compton, uhh, Dre found me in the slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin' ""Uhhhh!""
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, uhh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna stunt

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I put Lamborghini doors on that Escalade
Low pro, so look like I'm ridin' on blades
In one year mayne, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (ahh!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good, cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
This, is, how, we, do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we, do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we, do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

[Verse 3: The Game & 50 Cent]
I put gold Daytonas on that cherry six-fo'
White walls so clean, look like I'm ridin' on Vogues
Hit one switch mayne, that ass so low
Cali got niggas in New York ridin' on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Four pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (ahh!)
50, uhh, Bentley, uhh
Em came and got a nigga fresh out the slum
Automatic, gun, fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up your punk ass, stunt and you done
Homie, it's Game time! You ready? Here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months, but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, ""Huh?""
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass, slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head, lumped
50 got a, gun! Ready? Here it come
Got a sick ven-detta to get this, cheddar

The club isn't the best place to find a lover

And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 1]
I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh
And now Bush can't stop the hit
I predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas
Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Yeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 3]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The Penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather I'd be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

It's gettin' better all the time

This ol' job is all that I got left
And no one even noticed I'd been crying
But at least I don't have whiskey on my breath
Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it
'Cause God won't make a mountain I can't climb
It's gettin' better all the time
It's gettin' better all the time

God I hope you're happy
Girl I wish you well
I just might get over you
You can't ever tell

I always thought that I'd do something crazy
If I ever saw you out with someone else
But when the moment came last night, I couldn't say a word
I stood there in the dark all by myself

See me coming to town with my soul
Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holding onto the devil I know
All my troubles will hang on your trigger
Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth if you know where you're aiming
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you

See me kicking the door with my boots
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handing out a confection of venom
Heaven's drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight

Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're passed the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we've both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

[Hook]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

[Verse 2]
This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go

Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay
Maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow
We'll never know

Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine

My grandmother owned a nightclub on the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
Momma put me on a greyhound, and I went
To stay with her in the summertime
I'd box up those empty long necks and stack'em in the back and make
A hand
Then at night she'd let me sneak out of the kitchen and sit in with the band
Yes, I have sacked some quarterbacks and broke my share of bones along the way
I knew it wouldn't
Last forever, semi-pro always means semi-paid
I started climbing' drilling' rig, I'm oil field trash and
Proud as I can be
Then I took my songs and guitar and sang'em to a man from Tennessee

I've played every beer joint tavern from New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out every basketball arena

[Verse 2]
A star can't burn forever, and the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
But the glass won't
Ever be half empty in my optimistic mind
I'll still have a song to sing and a band to turn it up and
Play it loud
As long as there's a bar room with a corner stage and a honkytonk crowd

Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it

This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion

Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations

Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain

He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me

[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya.

309,Class Reunion (That Used To Be Us),"[Verse 1]
Well I rolled into town
With the ragtop down
I was looking for that homecoming queen
That three-by-nine lit hotel sign read
Welcome back class of '83
There were football guys twice their size
Cheerleaders hiding the grey in their hair
The names were the same but the faces had changed
I didn't recognize anyone there

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh, that used to be us

[Verse 2]
I had a drink with some buds
Played a lot of catch up
Danced with my date from the prom
But as hard as I tried until I closed my eyes
Everybody I knew was gone
There was Mr. Finch, he taught English and French
He was dancing with a couple of canes
And that homecoming queen, yeah the girl of my dreams
She didn't even remember my name

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us

[Bridge]
As I stand here and look around
I can't help but wonder
Who will we be ten years from now

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go

310,So Much More,"[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Intro]
I do It
For the city, man

[Verse 1]
Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free-throwed in ice
Debating with the Reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I've lived a couple lives
Like why? Cause I stunt? Bag the tree like it's fall?
The girls that was out of my league trying to play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard, and when my mama cried a river
They never gave us a bridge, they gave us a bridge card
Nigga riding low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said ""Me and your grandma proud""
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me to get a job, save up for 401(K)
Man, I'd rather be young as shit counting 401k
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs

[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Verse 2]
But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch, I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred I deserve
Throwing West side up like Pac up
Where they pop your block up, b-blocka big poppa flock off
You holy lil' whoaty holy kenobi chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I bet you that you won't find it
Rockin' Louis and MCM, I guess I'm clothes-minded
I'm in the Obama suite, you one below up in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chilling where all your hoes hiding?
20k for the fit because it's 24 carats
I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-town repping
Making all these niggas who second-guessed regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
At least I realize now how much I love Ashley Marie
And when it's all said and done, I'll probably get on my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man, she almost cried when she see me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy! Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy

[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Verse 3]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day's a Friday and every night's a sex scene
Every week is Fashion Week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's angel, I even got red wings
Headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
It's prom night, and guess who's the prom king?
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring
Tell me that wasn't the verse of the year
Man, that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints be overstuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up! Man, I turn impossible possible
And what these niggas could barely see into optimal
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do
Said I'm throwing my life away, if I drop out of school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
After I went down the road they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex: I should feed her fossil fuels
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules, lil' hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man they wanna see me dead, but I gave 'em dedication
And I'm yelling fuck 'em all with a hundred exclamations
Cause I'ma be the man til my fucking expiration

[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Outro]
BIG, I do it, this goes out to my muthafucking city of Detroit
Westside to be exact, right over there on Northlawn

Nothing but good things are coming my way
If you are going, please let me stay
You bring me down when I'm getting high
You turn me on, I amplify

1-2-3, times you've broken me (broken me)
1-2-3 (three) 1-2-3

I won't bleed like this forever
I'm down to ride but my wings are severed
Blindside blitz- evacuation
I'm stuck in hell, you're on vacation

1-2-3, times you've broken me (broken me)
1-2-3 (three) 1-2-3

I've been waiting
Waiting for the day
I've been waiting
Waiting for the day
I'm still waiting for tomorrow
Tired of living in yesterday
I've been waiting
Waiting for the day I'd be over you

Oceans, devotions, these notions run dry
Floating away and I don't know why
Spend all my days in a bottle thinking
You're like an anchor - got me sinking

1-2-3, times you've broken me (broken me)
1-2-3 (three) 1-2-3

Say goodbye now and mean it forever
Got to move on and keep it together
Forget the things that you've said and you've done
That's in the past, here comes the sun

1-2-3 times you've broken me (broken me)
1-2-3 (three) 1-2-3

I've been waiting
Waiting for the day
I've been waiting
Waiting for the day
I'm still waiting for tomorrow
Tired of living in yesterday
I've been waiting
Waiting for the day I'd be over you

Hello tomorrow and goodbye to yesterday
We've been waiting for this moment
And we still don't know what to say
We may never find the answers
Or know the reason why
Why we both decided we should say goodbye

I've been waiting
Waiting for the day
I've been waiting
Waiting for the day
I'm still waiting for tomorrow
Tired of living in yesterday
I've been waiting
Waiting for the day I'd be over you

317,God's Will,"[Verse one: AKA]
Lord give me solid gold
Give me endless knowledge and wisdom
Friend or foe? How do we go?
Who knows the difference?
Madiba notes, designer clothes, we on a mission
I’m on the road to riches
You on patrol for bitches
So control your ho, we step in the building
I turned it from a broken home into a family business
Coca Cola Dome went toe-to-toe with Grammy winners
Now there ain’t no brand proposal that don’t have me in it
We winnin’, survival of the fittest
I pray the bible guide me to the finish
Stack the paper higher by the minute
When it comes to desire, they say the sky is the limit
When it comes to lines of design, messiah image
Big dreams, tunnel vision is pristine
Analyse the paradigm shift to six feet
Now realise life is a chip so dig deep
This is God’s will ’till I’m buried in six feet

[Chorus: KO]
Life as a leader (a leader)
Some people wanna bury you
But if you a believer (believer)
Baba, your faith will carry you
Yehlis’umoya, ‘hlis’umoya, ‘hlis’umoya
Bade this is God’s will, nothing you can do about it
Yehlis’umoya, ‘hlis’umoya, ‘hlis’umoya
Budde this is God’s doing, and you can’t do nothing about it

[Verse two: KO]
Why you mad at me? It’s my time to blow
I’d like to know why i-life i-so
It’s my destiny, they try fight it though
My type of flow on the mic like a pro
You can’t fill my shoes o-size my babo
Nothing you can do on this mic that I ain’t done already
‘zob’omunye wale zi’naai that I wanna bury’
Never met a chick in my life that I wanna marry
From rags to riches that’s my itinerary
Cash-flow so perfect – heavy current
See I even got your ho surfing
I’m busy googling myself, you know soul-searching
If money talks, Nelson Mandela is my spokesperson
As we fight for survival and as we fight for the title
I am never scared I look straight into the eyes of a rival
On the mic I’m a psycho and I write what I like so
I’m here dropping verses like I’m reciting the bible
I am better than ever before true hard work
I draw my weapon and leave them in all true art work
You can’t stop my shine, I’m the naked truth
In my birthday suit by God’s design
I get my hustle on mfanakithi that’s right
And if you talking more money, baba let’s ride
And I told you before I’m part of the best five

319,How Do You Get That Lonely,"It was just another story printed on the second page, underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on his bedroom floor
There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home, then out on Mooresville Highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone

How do you get that lonely?
How do you hurt that bad to make you
Make the call that having no life at all is better than the life that you had?
How do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?
How do you get that lonely and nobody know?

Did his girlfriend break up with him?
Did he buy or steal that gun?
Did his mom and daddy forget to say ""I love you, son?""
Did no one see the writing on the wall?

I'm not blamin' anybody
We all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20
But I still don't understand

How do you get that lonely?
How do you hurt that bad to make you
Make the call that having no life at all was better than the life that you had?
How do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?
How do you get that lonely and nobody know?

I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river, and it made me complete

I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in

You're in deep water now pal don't foul out Pau
Pow pow down south how now brown cow
Loud mouth shout shout had to knock him out, Ciao
Bail him out now just put it on my Loud account
Steve Riff needs this, never will I back down
Sleep this, breathe this, never wear me out, clown
Read lips, she licks, tryna pull my trous' down
Weed lit, need Clipse playin' in the background
How how, I don't get it, should've got em out already
Little Greg Maddux mixed in with Roy Halladay
Andale, andale, arriba, arriba
Ash- Roth coming through your speakers
Yippeeya yeeah, about time we re'ed up
I was in the out crowd playing with some D cups
Ah now gee shucks, didn't mean to keep ya
They just need a little TLC every 3 months

[Chorus: Asher Roth]
Me and Chuck, we made this in the kitchen
I'm not bullshittin, really made this in the kitchen
Hook the mic up, MPC on the table
Wrote a couple rhymes, so check what I'm saying
Me and Chuck, we made this in the kitchen
I'm not bullshittin, really made this in the kitchen
Hook the mic up, MPC on the table
Wrote a couple rhymes, so check what I'm saying

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
Now I got my feet up without any sneakers
But if I did, they'd probably be some beat Chucks
Beat Chucks, beats up, beats up the knees bump
Bass be mean, make you lean like the Pisa
Meet the Grim Reaper, killin em in FIFA
Kick it in the back yard, sip a margarita
Eat the dark meat, pepper on the paprika
Could've kept East, but I had to see the sea cuz
Fievel knows freedom, kiddo don't be dumb
Me won't leave 215 in my green bud
Need bud, need bud, please only live once
Read a couple books while I'm soaking up the heat sun
We've only begun, beguns are beguns
Speak on you sheep, the Dos Equis He Man
Recon in Sweden, la vie European
Get up out of bed, turn my chi on

329,I May Hate Myself In The Morning,"Ain't it just like one of us
To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks
And say how you been, I've been wondering if
Maybe you've been thinkin about me
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Everyone's known someone that they
Just can't help but want
Even though we just can't make it work out
The want to, lingers on
So once again, we wind up in each other's arms
Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad
I guess that's what it is all lonely
Late night calls like this, that we try to find
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I may hate msyelf in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight",Lee Ann Womack,2005,"[98, 84, 67, 66, 66, 67, 70, 68, 70, 70, 72, 72, 73]",13

Hey, sister, why you all alone?
I'm standing out your window
Hey, little sister, can I come inside, dear?
I want to show you all my love
I want to be the only one
I know you like nobody ever, baby

[Chorus 1]
Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow
Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow

[Verse 2]
You whisper secrets in my ear
Slowly dancing cheek to cheek
Such a sweet thing when you open up, baby
They say I'll only do you wrong
Come together 'cause I understand
Just who you really are, yeah, baby

331,Soldier,"[Intro]
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealing
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealing
Willing to stick out my neck for respect, if it meant
Life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissing you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pouring salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 3]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rocking to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

332,Bring Em Out,"[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Tour bus looking like a brothel
Catching more bodies than Hostel
Flatbush Zombies put money in my pocket
If it's war against them, I'ma pop it
Word like apostles
Kid from the ghetto listening to heavy metal, rock rolled in my sock
I ain't never been afraid, renegade got bars like mess halls
Locked three meals in the cot, nigga, what?
Pussy at noon got me feeling brand new
When the sun come down, I'm leavin'
Fuck I look like? A fool?
Throwing shade like cool, bitch don't wake me up, I'm dreamin'
Puff, puff, pass, that's old school
I'm getting yesterday's paper, that's old news
The way I'm programmed, I never hold hands
Straight business, first class, never the coach
I'ma handle the game the way I handle the coke
Hand to hand on Instagram, picture the post
Nigga, picture me broke, I got a pitcher of Henny
I know my liver be ready for adios, but I'm stuck like
I'm a sure thing, I don't close call
I mean we all kings, but there's one god
There's one Allah, there's one Jah, bless

[Hook: Bodega Bamz]
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out
All them pussy ass niggas, bring 'em out, bring 'em out

All them lying ass niggas, bring 'em out, bring 'em out
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out
All them lying ass niggas, bring 'em out, bring 'em out

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
Now I pose for pictures, can't fuck with you, be more specific
Cross me like when you beg forgiveness
I didn't like your vibe so I kept my distance
Niggas do it all for the paper
Institution was made then strewn to little girls and boys
But now ""the world is yours,"" my nigga please
I done gross over a hundred G's
That's a lot of of money, still I'm screaming, ""Fuck the police!""
In my motions I can't pretend that I'm different than you
But nigga listen and pay attention when I make a move
Vision blurred, I don't see no deterrence
But seeing the same niggas then saying the same words
Cycling that nature, puffing the same flavor
My niggas is Tanboys, original delegators
We ripping the floor panel and all
With a matter of force we go and handle you boys
We only family of course

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Nobody ever gave a fuck about us, you never believed
Can't believe they fucking doubted, now they can see
Child of the corn, Darko, freak off the leash
Rather unique, who art thou Van Gogh?
Randy Savage on beats, I bark proud, pitbull
If you break in my house he bark wild, fuck you talking 'bout?!
Lil nigga I spark proud, pop a band
Throw up bread, you should learned it by now
Make 'em say, ""ugh,"" then examine her mouth
Then it's get to stepping, I'm kicking Pamela out (Get to stepping!)
That Tommy hold a lot of slugs might be a hundred rounds
Them Flatbush niggas a shmurda ya, rusty tre pounds
Shoot you and throw it in the air, like a cap and gown
I demand the throne and the crown, tell 'em I want it now (Ha!)
Hair swinging when I'm shooting like O-Dog in that movie
Zombie gang fully lucid, Bathing Ape, fully draped
GG Allin lucky I ain't get to shit on his grave
Knuckle it behind bars like a prisoner in cage
Johnny Cage, black shades, hit off half yo face
My orange box-cutter make the world rotate
My orange box-cutter make the world rotate
On its axis, acid, sheets that ain't for the mattress, bastard

[Verse 4: Zombie Juice]
I need a honor roll for this shit, I need a honor roll for this shit
Thank the Lord it's lit, thank the Lord it's lit
Hopping out a bodega, need a pack, never later, later
Flatbush, Tanboy stylin' (WHOO!)
All my niggas get lit like a chalice, all my niggas get lit like a chalice
Cookies in my blunt, liquor in my gut, most you niggas suck
I'm on top of the world like Brandy said
So high, so high like Michel'le
Feeling unstoppable every bone and my particles
In the cut blowing tropicals
And they said it's impossible for a black young man to kill this shit
For a tan young man to kill this shit
So, more or less I do my thing
No stress, no crane, progression, mane
More or less we do our thing
No stress, no crane, progression, mane

But I don't know who to trust
When I look into your eyes
There's just devils and dust
We're a long, long way from home, Bobbie
Home's a long, long way from us
I feel a dirty wind blowing
Devils and dust

[Chorus]
I got God on my side
And I'm just trying to survive
What if what you do to survive
Kills the things you love
Fear's a powerful thing, baby
It can turn your heart black you can trust
It'll take your God filled soul
And fill it with devils and dust

[Verse 2]
Well I dreamed of you last night
In a field of blood and stone
The blood began to dry
The smell began to rise
Well I dreamed of you last night, Bobbie
In a field of mud and bone
Your blood began to dry
And the smell began to rise

[Chorus]
We've got God on our side
We're just trying to survive
What if what you do to survive
Kills the things you love
Fear's a powerful thing
It'll turn your heart black you can trust
It'll take your God filled soul
Fill it with devils and dust
It'll take your God filled soul
Fill it with devils and dust

[Verse 3]
Now every woman and every man
They want to take a righteous stand
Find the love that God wills
And the faith that He commands
I've got my finger on the trigger
And tonight faith just ain't enough
When I look inside my heart
There's just devils and dust

[Chorus]
Well I've got God on my side
And I'm just trying to survive
What if what you do to survive
Kills the things you love
Fear's a dangerous thing
It can turn your heart black you can trust
It'll take your God filled soul
Fill it with devils and dust
Yeah it'll take your God filled soul
Fill it with devils and dust",Bruce Springsteen,2005,[72],1
334,Mud On The Tires,"[Verse 1]
I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]
Cause it's a good night
To be out there soaking up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight

[Chorus]
And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half

[Verse 2]
They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
Because when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count on you to help me win
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters

[Verse 1]
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man

Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Get 'em Jay!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]
Encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Outro: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]

341,Let Them Be Little,"[Verse 1]
I can remember when you fit in the palm of my hand
Felt so good in it, no bigger than a minute
How it amazes me, you're changing with every blink
Faster than a flower blooms they grow up all too soon

[Chorus]
So let them be little cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give them praise, give them love every day
Let them cry, let them giggle, let them sleep in the middle
Oh just let them be little

[Verse 2]
I've never felt so much in one little tender touch
I live for those kisses, prayers and your wishes
Now that you're teaching me things only a child can see
Every night while we're on our knees all I ask is please

Let them be little cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give them praise, give them love every day
Let them cry, let them giggle, let them sleep in the middle
Oh just let them be little

So innocent, a precious soul, you turn around
It's time to let them go

342,Like Toy Soldiers,"[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, ‘cause—

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, ‘cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated — it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, ‘cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience ‘cause—

343,So What The Fuss,"[Verse 1]
If i'm caught at a dance party without my dancing shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet
Shame on me
If i'm minding my business just doing the right thing
And you try to front me off in the street
Shame on you
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to
Come their way
But they ain't trying to get on their knees and pray
Shame on them
And if we live in a time where every nation's fighting
Around the world
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way
Shame on us

Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

If i gotta get up early in the morning for a job
Interview
And i forget to set the stupid alarm
Shame on me
If my children are playing outside like little children do
And you come around there trying to bring them some harm
Shame on you
Should i be driving thru a klantown, find a restaurant
To get me some food
And someone says ""hey boy, we don't serve your kind""
Shame on them
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your
Power to vote
Knowing some would like to turn back the hands of time
Shame on us

Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

[Verse 3]
If I'm hooked on a habit knowing damn well it could
Cost me my life
Yet i keep doing what i should do without
Shame on me
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half
Just gives you abuse
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Shame on you
If we're jamming the music and somebody's got the
Audacity
To say that they can jam it better than us
Shame on them
And should there be just a handful that believe that
We are totally free
And there's no need to fight for equality
Shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

351,Trying To Find Atlantis,"I hear he's out there
Somewhere
Been looking for him everywhere
From Roswell to Timbuktu
I thought I found him once at a Jiffy Lube
But it turned in
To a dead end
So I got my oil changed and I tried again
He was a major in archaeology
I was digging on him but he wasn't on me
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

I met a mystic down in Memphis
We stood at the foot of the pyramid
He had me looking east
He had me looking west
Then he sold me a map and said I wish you the best
There was Elvis
Not the real one
When he told me goodbye he called me hon'
Just another shot in the dark
Like El Dorado or Noah's Ark
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

Oh yeah it is
It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

I said a girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis
Trying to find Atlantis
Yeah
Oh I'm still trying to find Atlantis
Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when

Made of clove splintered shards

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Must I hide? 'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone

Look at how they flock to him
From an isle of open sores
He knows that the taste is such
Such to die for
And I hear him every night on every street
The scales that do slither deliver me from

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Then I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone

Oh lord, said I'm, said I'm, said I'm
Said I'm, bloodshot for sure
Pale runs the ghost, said I'm, said I'm
Swollen on the shore, swollen on the shore
In every night, in every pore
The scales that do slither deliver me from

Then I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone
Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Let me die, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone

355,"Awful, Beautiful Life","I woke up early this morning with a pounding in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wondering what i did
I said lord please forgive me for my sins
My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first
You're going if i have to drag your butt to church

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it throught the sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
My poor mother sat between them both all night

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

We said a prayer for cousin micheal in iraq
We're all aware he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he wanted to be a soldier more than most

I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life was like a rollercoaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or i might live on for years

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic

But I can't close the lid

The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it

Is nowhere to be found

And laid it in the ground

And I'm sure you've made it there

361,I'm Not Okay (I Promise),"[Verse 1]
Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay, now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

362,Nothin 'Bout Love Makes Sense,"[Verse 1]
Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky
Ice shouldn't burn or a bumble bee fly
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense
Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense

[Chorus]
Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'
You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'
I can't figure it out
Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation
Nothin' short of amazin'
Wish I could explain it
But I don't know how

[Verse 2]
The way that we dance
The reason we dream
That big Italian tower
Oh, how does it lean
Somethin' so strong
Shouldn't make me this weak
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense

[Repeat Chorus:]
Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'
You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'
I can't figure it out
Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation
Nothin' short of amazin'
Wish I could explain it
But I don't know how

[Bridge]
Like the lights of Las Vegas glowin' out of the sand
A jumbo shrimp or a baby grand
How you touch my heart when you hold my hand
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense

Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh

[Verse 1]
Hold up, stop ma, let me get a look at'cha
Damn girl, I ain't seen you since prom
Come to think about it, can't believe it's been that long
I heard your man locked down now, how long he gone?
Oh that long? How the hell'd he get time like that
Three strikes with possession - aw he ain't coming back
He left you with two kids and bills all around
Plus you found out he had another chick 'cross town
It's always the darkest, ah-right before the sun rising
And you gotta stay strong, for the kids in they eyes and
And please don't despise, and go against all brothers
And have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another
I hate to sound 2Pac-ish lil' mama, but keep ya head up
But you gon' make it, I promise - you keep your head up
And that that don't kill you only makes you stronger
And the will to succeed'll only feed the hunger, f'real
F'real, f'real, hey

[Verse 2]
I was at the gas station when a man walked past
With a sign ""will work for food, clothes or cash""
And he asked if he could pump my gas - so I let him
Clean the windshield and throw out the trash - so I let him
Hey, I even asked the brother his name
Where he was from, got kids man and what's they age
He kinda sturred for a second, he kinda looked surprise
That anyone would even take an interest in his life
He said, ""Young brother dem the only wurrds, I done hurrd, in the last yurr
That wasn't low or get the fuck away from hurr""
How could something so simple as general conversation
Mean much more than general conversation? Hey
You could tell life had beaten him down
Like he was in a title fight and this might be his last round
Sometimes the easiest things we take for granted
Until they gone, to realize we even had it, f'real
F'real, f'real, hey

Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh

[Verse 3]
I used to think that life had a plan for me
Until I realized, life had to be planned by me
See that's the key, I only deal with what I can see
'Cause over history, mystery brought us nutting but misery
Man mo' people done died, in the name of the Lord
Than in any natural disaster, disease or gang war
Before guns there was swords, and they was killing each other
Ain't much changed since the days, we still killing each other
Killing our brothers while another mother cries for help
Man, we need to help a brother find himself
Feed him, life, ah-one-twoooo, three
Hey, that's something e'ry brother should see, and that's f'real
And that's f'real, and that's f'real, hey

[Chorus]

My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And it's a wrap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there (Put a car right there)
I'm the truth
And I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
'Cause they seen me do it (They seen me do it)

On her back, picking out baskets of fruit
I love you, boo
Yeah, Freaky Petey love you too, ha-ha
You know how I do it (That goodie goodie)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ciara]
You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl

Sexy, independent, gotta spend-it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not being too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

Hey shorty, you don't play the game (Wait a minute)
You think you bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom, bada bam bam bam (I'm Bad)

You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy, are not

Just respect the play I'm callin'!

365,Some Beach,"[Verse 1]
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

[Chorus]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 2]
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

[Chorus 2]
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 3]
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

[Chorus 3]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere

Damn, I don't know who I am
I just know who I wanna be
No lookin' back, everything is in front of me
I never act like they puttin' a gun to me
I ain't stuck up, same motherfucker that I've always been
You must got me fucked up, think I changed when I got that all white Benz?
Never that though
Been on my job, sayin' I'm different now
Say I don't listen now
I don't got time to pick up the phone to hear what you bitchin' 'bout
I'm on a mission, feel like I'm missin' now
Bitch, you ain't in my position now
You never walked a mile in my shoes
I'm feeling so distant now

Gotta keep prayin' (Prayin')

Livin' on the edge, I'm bound to fall (Fall)
But I stay movin', stay climbin' (Climbin')
Puttin' in work, I stay grindin' (Grindin')
Lookin' for the answer, can't find it (Find it)

370,Across The Universe,"[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do

[Hook 1]
He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me

His curly hair and his knobby knees
The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat

[Hook 1]
Yeah, he gets that from me
He gets that from me

[Chorus 1]
He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you

[Chorus 2]
How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me

He gets that from you

After I done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you
Oooh!
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you

Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Oooh!
You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference of a man and an adolescent

375,Landed,"[Verse 1]
We'd hit the bottom
I thought it was my fault
In a way I guess it was
I'm just now finding out
What it was all about
Moved to the west coast
Away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still
I was still in love

[Chorus]
Until I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
And I twisted it wrong
Just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up
I've landed

[Verse 2]
The daily dramas
She made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me
And talk me back down
Until I believed
I was the crazy one
And in a way I guess I was

[Chorus]
But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
Treading the sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
If you wrote me off
I'd understand it
Because I've been on
Some other planet
So come pick me up
I've landed

[Bridge]
And you will be so
Happy to know
I've come alone
It's over

[Chorus]
But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's okay to call
And I will answer for myself

Come pick me up
Come pick me up

Pretending the echoes belong to someone

Silhouettes when our bodies finally go

I wanted to walk through the empty streets
And feel something constant under my feet
But all the news reports recommended that I stay indoors
Because the air outside will make
Our cells divide at an alarming rate
Until our shells simply cannot hold all our insides in
And that's when we'll explode
And it won't be a pretty sight

So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?

Say ""Hova!"" – c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]

You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted

Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip

How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw

380,Vertigo,"[Verse 1]
Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up?
I’m breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been better off than broken
I’ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up? (Who am I?)
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?

Are we alive?

381,When I Think About Cheatin',"I've never done anything
That would ever bring a tear to your eye
I've never crossed the line
Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
But darling I'll admit
There've been times when I could have
The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on my mind

[Chorus]
When I think about cheatin'
I just think about you leavin'
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
Oh there's never any danger
I just think about you leavin'
When I think about cheatin'

There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down
Between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone, and I was missing you
He never had a chance, cause I broke up the dance
Before the song was through

I ain't got no motherfuckin' friends
That's why I fucked yo' bitch, you fat motherfucker!
(Take money) West Side, Bad Boy killas
(Take money) You know who the realest is
(Take money) We bring it too
(Take money)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
First off, fuck yo' bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

[Chorus: 2Pac]
See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Check this out, you motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't even know why I'm on this track
Y'all niggas ain't even on my level
I'ma let my little homies ride
On you bitch-made ass Bad Boy bitches, feel it!

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo', pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]
You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

[Outro: 2Pac]
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, ha ha
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob
When we always on our job?
We millionaires
Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?
You're fuckin' with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it!
But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama
Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!
We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!
Now when I came out I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth
With a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this: fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!
And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!
Chino XL, fuck you too!
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!
(Take money, take money)
All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you, die slow!
Motherfucker, my .44 make sho' all y'all kids don't grow!
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life ridas
Westside 'til we die!
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers! We do our job!
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob!
Ain't nothin' but killas
And the real niggas, all you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple
You niggas laugh 'cause our staff got guns under their motherfuckin' belts
You know how it is: when we drop records, they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest

Uh, Killa! Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Ugh, I'm back in, ugh, ugh
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo, street mergers I legislated, the nerve I never hated
On murders premeditated, absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck ya ace, take ya girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior, Star-Spangled Banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh)

Our girls is the models (Oh)
They coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh)
Money back on my mind (No no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina: put ya legs behind ya head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's ""Pet Sematary""
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was Touch Me, Tease Me when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', aaow!

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)

They coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)

Money back on my mind (No no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Uh, Killa, yo, yo...
Ayo you dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice ya face, you're it!
It's I who come by drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her ""Hi boo, how you?
Pony skin Louis? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good ma, I fly too""
Now a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem Shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just ya picture though, you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the fo'
I hope a nigga heard when I said ""I told you so""
Uh, Killa

Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion

No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

387,Let's Go,"[Spoken Intro]
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Ad lib/Instrumental break]
C'mon baby
Let's get nuts!
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy!

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!
Go (Go crazy)

[Bridge]
I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go!)
Go (Let's go!)

[Verse 3]
Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children
He's coming
He's coming
Coming

388,Dare You To Move,"[Verse 1]
You're saying nothing
But your eyes do the talking
Through the greens and blues
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

Your heart is grooving
But your body's still refusing
Cause it's scared to lose
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

[Verse 2]
We're getting closer
But the night is nearly over
Gonna lose the moon
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

And now you're loving
There's a barrel full of tension
Gonna flood this room
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

[Chorus]
Run with me into midnight
Run with me while we're young
Rebels will run from street lights
To the burning sun
Run with me into violence
Run with me into blues
Hills can find horizons
If they dare to move

[Verse 3]
You're saying nothing
But your eyes do the talking
Through the greens and blues
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

Your heart is grooving
But your body's still refusing
Cause it's scared to lose
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

[Chorus]
Run with me into midnight
Run with me while we're young
Rebels will run from street lights
To the burning sun
Run with me into violence
Run with me into blues
Hills can find horizons
If they dare to move

Run with me into midnight
Run with me while we're young
Rebels will run from street lights
To the burning sun
Run with me into violence
Run with me into blues
Hills can find horizons
If they dare to move",McFly,2005,"[49, 35, 27, 28, 25, 25, 21]",7
389,Go D.J.,"[Intro]
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,2005,"[81, 75, 66, 59, 47, 43, 34]",7

Love, love, love

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
A yo.. the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for french curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team
Its only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carries the money, the hammer, and material across town
And understand she fine
Understand she mine
She understand the grind
Cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever shes wanna push I'mma cosign
And if I ain't got it already than I'mma go find it
I guess I'mma lucky don, and shes a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones
And she know that I'm in the hood, but she also knows that I'm coming home
Mr. Raspy, thought I was in love with money
'Til the first time we getting nasty

[Hook: Mariah Carey/Jadakiss]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uh yo, Whatever the road to paradise is we on it
Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything, even my rhymes
I will play a song for you
And you will let me know exactly how the ladies will respond from a womens
Point of view
And that's why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so its crazy ill
And we waiting on the new island
We been to all them 4, 5 times come on mommy you whilin

[Hook: Mariah Carey/Jadakiss]

[Bridge: Jadakiss/Mariah Carey]
When things was ruff only person I could call was you
Now everything I do I do it all 4 you

Come touch me, come kiss me, come love me neway you wanna boy

N I'm hood as long as I'm close to you
N we doing wut grown folks is suppose to do

Come hold me, come feel me, come take me anyway you wanna baby

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
A yo the money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart its more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we build
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
Damn I'm thinking that you gotta hate it
But yet and still you tolerate it
That's why ma we gotta make it

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay!
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop… pajama time!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know; who'd hear it?
Give a little ""poot poot,"" it's okay
(*fart*) Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Just lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Go crazy! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Oh, baby (Ah, ah-!) oh, baby, baby (Ah, ah-!)

[Bridge 1: Eminem]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind!
Dre (ah, aA), be-!e,r goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm…

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Just lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Go crazy! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Oh, baby (Ah, ah-!) oh, baby, baby (Ah, ah-!)

[Bridge 2: Eminem]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin', (Ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back, and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality; look, it's B. Rabbit!
""Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!""
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba Teletubby
Fellas! (What?) Fellas! (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt-squeezin', it's the season
Just go, (Ah, ah, ah, ah-!); it's so appeasin'

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Just lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)

392,Holy Water,"[Produced by SAP]

[Hook]
My Phantom so mean
Like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water
Holy water

[Verse 1]
Back when Michael Jordan was raw
'92 was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em
Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
Return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's
Then you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4's
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin' on my car cause

Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian
Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission
Trynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her
And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain
Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide
Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies
Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!

Baby, hit this weed because it might calm you down

No stress hit off the chest, God I made it, I'm off of paper
Certificate of completion, I felt like I graduated
Enough about that, I ain't come for that
I came to comfort pussy drippin' through your draws
Water mean need to be punctured

In the mirror makin' faces, I'm killin' ya from the back
Stuffin' dick in you slow, tryna rip the track from your scalp
Phone ring, bitch you know you can't answer

It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doing
How I'm holding up
Since you did me wrong

[Chorus]
Well how am I doing since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doing since you did what you done to me

[Verse 1]
Well now wait one minute, I
Failed to mention
Those tears I cried, are tears of joy
Cause' it was no fun there
Under your thumb and
Now that we're done I'm
Getting right every night
With every single ever-loving girl in sight, so

[Verse 2]
Well when all my friends heard what a
You know what you were they
Took me out on the town
But then I heard our song and
I dance along but
It felt all wrong cause

She never took her ever-loving eyes off me so

In the studio all work, no play
I could pay a visit to your block all day
Fuck what ya’ll say I spit raw hard yay
Millz twisting up the sticky not that barnyard hay
We just getting to the money then get on our way
Yep, 3 whips back to back
Followed by a Cadillac
Trucks, sluts with us, fake tits and their asses fat
Gudda ain't your average cat, I’m something like a savage that
Came up in the jungle and adjusted to this habitat
I’m sick of nigga garbage raps
I ain't bout to battle rap
Grab the gat, hit 'em in his chest make a cabbage patch
I’m after that chedder cheese nigga
Where the cabbage at?
Gudda Gudda motherfucker there’ll be nothing after that
I’m bout to go HAM on this motherfucking track
In fact I’m better than a lot of niggas better get your raps intact
See me on that big screen and think shits sweet
Diarrhea music when I let this hot shit leak
Uhh, take heed and listen when a real nigga speak
Or slide on a razor blade up shits creek, nigga

[Hook - Gudda Gudda/Lil Wayne]
Uhh, I’m screaming MOB

I’m talking big money bitch

Take money like a pimp make money like a mint
Gettin money is the only time life make sense
People like me, but people like spiders
And spiders eat flies and you know what flies eat
And kids are the only ones that really blush
I’m real as fuck
I pull that thing and get 'em up
That bullet travel hit a gut
Then hit your fitted up
Hit your whole city up
Hit you while you laying down
Shots leave you sittin up
Run in the bathroom on your girl and get a titty fuck
Right after I bust a nut I bust the gun get rid of her
Y'a bunch of pussy’s having a pity party
My guns look like they in kindergarten
I’m the dirtiest seed in any garden
Got more stripes on my sleeve than any sergeant
The paralyzed feel me, the blind see me
And the deaf can hear me
And the smart fear me
Wh-which side you on?
Hi-highway to heaven, I would drive you home
Uhh

She hit the door 6:55 sack full of groceries split down the side
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb
Look on her face saying don't say a word
So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing
Western sky all turning red
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said

[Chorus]
Been gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there ain't nothing I swear man that I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like i can't make it through
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

[Verse 2]
She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me
I was gonna run the bank
I was gonna run the math
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath
Back then you know I had this plan
Before all of this reality set in
Here comes life boy ready or not
Hey I wanted it all and that's what I got

Because I'm gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman

Good ol' boys, good ol' girls
Lookin' to burn down this night
Tailgates dropped, radios up
Little jack, little crown spillin down, fillin' up those cups

They're probably starin' down that muddy field
Waitin' on my high beams, my KCs
They know I wouldn't miss a party like that for anything
But they can't see what I see

I'm layin', layin' you down on the other side of town
Nobody around, but you and me baby
The high that you got me on is some kinda strong

And I'll hold you all night long girl
Come lay your head down
Down on my chest
It's a party for two in this truck bed

Right now, the whiskey's chilled
Radio low, you and me, kickin' it up on this hill
The moon's shinin', the stars are bright
But I've never seen 'em, like I see 'em, when I see 'em in your eyes

They're probably starin' down that muddy field
Waitin' on my high beams, my KCs
That's why I picked this spot where only my truck can make it

Dejemos todo para hablar después
Hagámoslo como tiene que ser
Damos la cara para que puedan ver
Que nos pueden tirar, pero van a correr
Y que van a intentar tener alguna vez
Toda esta habilidad para soltarlo flex
Y no van a alcanzar girar a este nivel
Estamos más allá aunque no lo puedan creer
Pero nos ven pasar y no saben que hacer
Saben que nuestro track lo baila su mujer
Que Bardero$ se va y nadie nos ve volver
Esto es pure drug hasta el amanecer
Haciendo money a todo horario
Y malgastandola con los chicos del barrio
Solo queremos un aumento de salario
Pa' poder vivir la vida que viven los millonarios
Y mis boys van al frente todo el tiempo, son
Solo salimos en busca de la evolución
Cada cual puede sacar su propia conclusión
Pero saben que esta click es una en un millón
Quieren jugar pero no tengo tiempo
Más, ¿quieren copiar los que les venden, cierto?
No se si lo que hacemos es correcto
Pero deja money, y eso está perfecto
No quiero que me digan lo que ya sabemos
Porque sumar ahora nos cuesta menos
Nos decidimos a ganar el juego
Si en cualquier terreno, nos lo merecemos
Nos vamos siempre pa'l mismo lugar
Pasados de alcohol, cansados de brillar
Esto es Bardero$ click, la mierda mas real
Basta con tanta shit, volvimos a ganar, bitch

Son las tres, son las 3, afuera hace frío
Al menos sonrío, no por vos, sino por hash
No por vos, sino por hash
No por vos, sino por hash
Dame más, dame más
Le seguis disparando al miedo
Criticando en esta mierda
Sin saber que hay más misterios
Dame cash, dame paz, dame todo lo que quiero
Lo merezco por nacer demasia'o lejos de este cielo
Vuelvo a cero, vuelvo a cero, el mundo mira raro
¿Será por lo que vendemos o por todos esos disparos?
Agarramos si queremos, si queremos lo llevamos
Si llegamos no nos vemos, y si nos vemos le negociamos

Hahahaha, man, you crazy

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
‘Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
‘Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back
Please, ain't nothing left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too, you know

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway

I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
‘Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away

Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin'
Aye, so you remember that
Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby

If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me",2Pac,2005,"[100, 98, 100, 98]",4
411,Charlene,"[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
Too hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
She must have told me a thousand times before
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

[Verse 2]
She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds, and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her

[Chorus]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone away
I pray that she'll come back one day

Promise I'll be here to the very end

But I told you I would have you and I don't like to lie

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Out on the sidewalk and then underneath the colora
A photographic power, I told you to love her
But you come with me again because you're dying to be free
And I come with you again because it comes so easily

Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch, they're burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall

With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss

Nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back

R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, ""That's what's up!""
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker

Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame

Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?

33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop

In the middle of a crowd of folks I didn't know
I heard 'em laughin' at me lyin' there

Self-proclaimed free
While trapped by the blindin' symptoms of addiction
At twenty nine
Am I alive?
If I am, I am just barely holdin' on to life

Music used to be my way to escape
Good to bad and everything between
Now it's become what defines my name
Oh I wonder who it was I used to be
And if I still
Have the will
To finish what I started, right or wrong

I've forgotten what it feels like to be alone

I watched the sunrise and it made me think of you
The way you talk to the flowers and make them grow
And in the middle of all these flowers
There's one single stem red rose
It stood out from the rest the fairest of them all
It made me think of what you asked me
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Lady your body moves like poetry
Like a diamond in the raw
You shine for me
No one else can hold her hand up to you girl
Cause you're everything I need in my world lady

Can you call a rose by any other name
Here inside your garden it's like I feel unchanged
Can you call a rose by any other name?

In there, I got a song for you boy
Telling the world about the joy inside my garden

In the shade baby

Uhh, can the headphones go louder?
Kanye West!
Yup, Swag King Cole, yup

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you motherfuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
Flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
G.O.O.D. Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some Theraflu
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the Theraflu
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the Theraflu

Slide on Josephine, holla at Lil' Kia and Pluck
My nigga Troy'll tell it, hey they keep it real as fuck
We goin' to House of Blues tonight after the DJ in the Nolia
On Washington and Frerret, across the street from Babosca
But first I'm bout to snatch up all Saratogas
Head straight to Foot Action and snatch me two pair of Soldiers
Take a left on Taladonna get a oh of that doja

Or hit P town, I heard they drop it off
My couson Leaf from the Vill told me to swing through, on St. Lou
He got two hoes that'll eat and drink too
We can bounce through the Lafitte and we can fuck with these hoes
They take dick in they ass, they take dick in the throat
They take dick in they ear, they take dick in they nose
They take a dick, anywhere your dick can go
But look, it ain't nothin' like my bitch out the St. Bernard
A gangsta broad, get Wacko gangsta hard
She said we might could run a train if I pursue my G
If not I got it poppin' off on Music Street
Last week I had to do about two of them freaks

OK, we fell off for a minute but that Nolia back
We got quarters, ounces, and halfs and birds of smack
Ever since Soulja got killed I keep a murder gats
Stand on the middle of my projects where the murders at
And every nigga, every bitch who ain't heard of Wack
I bang women, bang children, bang them murder cats
I bang blocks, bang cribs, bang the Burban Lac'

I'm just the hit to represent where I was born and raised
And every nigga in my section love to roam with K's

Ain't no game off in this thing, we be deep off in your party

So, if a nigga come and run they mouth just like a hoe
Punch them dead up in his nose and stomp his ass down to the flo'

I betcha I'ma throw them things, so haters best to think twice
See, me, I ain't nothing nice, and Crime Mob, it ain't no stopping

Flawless niggas, lawless, you'll be jawless getting close to me
Bullets busting constantly, rapping in your city streets
Broken bones lay alone, scattered across the concrete
Knucking if you bucking, you'll be ducking if you get too close
In my eyes, you wasn't wise, I think it's time I knuck you, hoe

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow

434,You're My Everything,"You're my everything
The sun that shines above
You makes the blue bird sing
The stars that twinkle way up in the sky
Tell me I'm in love

When I kiss your lips
I feel the rolling thunder to my fingertips
And all the while my head is a spin
Deep within I'm in love

You're my everything
And nothing really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big brown eyes
You're my everything
Forever and a day I need you close to me
You're my everything
You'll never have to worry, never fear for I am near

For my everything
I lived upon the land and see the sky above
I'll swim within her oceans sweet and warm
There's no storm, my love

You're my everything
No, nothing really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big brown eyes
You're my everything
Forever and a day I need you close to me
You're my everything
You'll never have to worry, never fear for I am near

When I hold you tight
There's nothing that can harm you in the lonely night
I'll come to you and keep you safe and warm
It's so strong my love

When I kiss your lips
I feel the rolling thunder to my fingertips
And all the while my head is a spin
Deep within I'm in love",Santa Esmeralda,2005,[99],1
